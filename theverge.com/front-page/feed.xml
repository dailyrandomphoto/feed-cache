    <title>Duolingo interprets 2021, with TikTok and Squid Game inspiring users to learn new languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSZHj4tzG1JnmivcQqed7csWGVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233479/acastro_20200723_1777_duolingo_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V4N1Cu"&gt;Language learning app Duolingo said its phrase of the year is “I am mentally exhausted,” which appears as part of its Japanese course and does seem to nicely sum up 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y5QWo"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo is giving users a look back at the year that was. Starting today, anyone who completed at least 10 Duolingo lessons in 2021 can get a personalized look at what kind of language learner they are, based on when they practice their lessons, how many courses they’ve taken, and how many hours they spent learning on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2mhVkQ2wtenSakDPmW3MEd6ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063133/duolingo_yir_learnerstylereviel.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Duolingo’s Year in Review will tell you want kind of language learner you were in 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joExSM"&gt;In its 2021 language report and survey, Duolingo said the top five languages learned on the app this year were Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and German, with Korean rising in popularity worldwide. Among those who started a new language on Duolingo during the pandemic, 80 percent used the mobile app to conduct lessons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFWk73"&gt;More than two-thirds of users Duolingo surveyed said a “cultural event” might inspire them to try to pick up a new language, with 29 percent saying TikTok videos in other languages served as motivation That number was even higher among Gen Z users, at 40 percent. Among those who were inspired by a streaming show to learn a new language, 37 percent started lessons in Spanish after watching &lt;em&gt;Money Heist; &lt;/em&gt;28 percent decided to learn Korean after watching &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and 20 percent took up French after watching &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrGv28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/language-learning-app-duolingo-pops-35percent-in-public-debut-on-the-nasdaq.html"&gt;Pittsburgh-based company, which went public in July&lt;/a&gt;, had a busy 2021. In May, founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, a native of Guatemala, joined Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/duolingo-founder-a-pittsburgher-and-immigrant-puts-his-app-to-work-fighting-illiteracy-in-central-america/"&gt;push for businesses&lt;/a&gt; to invest in Central America. The app also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362723/duolingo-yiddish-language-classes"&gt; added its 40th language, Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A humanoid robot makes eerily lifelike facial expressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtkc7nfCk1gCHrJ5Wh8I2lKA2IY=/399x0:2381x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232539/humanoid_robot_facial_expression.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Engineered Arts via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPukuYb9xWw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy5qdC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/"&gt;Engineered Arts&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of humanoid robots, recently showed off one of its most lifelike creations in a video posted on YouTube. The robot, called &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/"&gt;Ameca&lt;/a&gt;, is shown making a series of incredibly human-like facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3ekFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ameca opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP8LbE"&gt;At the start of the video, Ameca appears to “wake up,” as its face conveys a mix of confusion and frustration when it opens its eyes. But when Ameca starts looking at its hands and arms, the robot opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement. The end of the video shows Ameca smiling and holding a welcoming hand out towards the viewer — if that’s how you want to interpret that gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEUbI5"&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but Ameca doesn’t walk, flip, or do parkour like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot does&lt;/a&gt;. That said, we likely won’t see Ameca walking and talking among us anytime soon. Engineered Arts says the bot is currently unable to walk, although it wants to give it that ability at some point. As for whether Ameca operates using AI, Engineered Arts explains that it leaves AI capabilities up to developers — it just handles the ultra-realistic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lmwh1s"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTny-MYb4tE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJvjka"&gt;If Ameca doesn’t creep you out enough, Engineered Arts also developed another realistic bot, named &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/mesmer/"&gt;Mesmer&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it used 3D scans of actual humans to give the bot accurate bone structure, skin texture, and lifelike facial expressions. In a video posted just days after the Ameca showcase, Mesmer makes a series of expressions that looks even more convincing, given that this bot has more lifelike skin and facial features than Ameca does at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8NESR"&gt;Since Engineered Arts focuses on creating humanoid robots for entertainment, Ameca and Mesmer will likely be the center of attention at venues and events, rather than robots designed to do a specific job or take over all of humanity. If you want to see Ameca in real life, Engineered Arts says it’ll be on display at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;CES 2022 in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI is closer to getting a US patent for its facial recognition technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNVLdCyF7o8CbXOveUXadxcYvYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232333/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DEjBy"&gt;Clearview AI is on track to receive a US patent for its facial recognition technology, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/04/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-523735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company was reportedly sent a “notice of allowance” by the US Patent and Trademark Office, which means that once it pays the required administration fees, its patent will be officially approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBbFf6"&gt;Clearview AI builds its facial recognition database using images of people that it scrapes across social media (and the internet in general), a practice that has the company steeped in controversy. The company’s &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s1=20210042527.PGNR.&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; details its use of a “web crawler” to acquire images, even noting that “online photos associated with a person’s account may help to create additional records of facial recognition data points,” which its machine learning algorithm can then use to find and identify matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CisU2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcnlGq"&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy and that it may negatively impact minority communities. The technology is allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21131991/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-database-law-enforcement"&gt;less accurate when identifying people of color and women&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to false arrests when used by law enforcement agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfIc6"&gt;Last year, the company said that its technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402978/clearview-ai-ceo-interview-2400-police-agencies-facial-recognition"&gt;used by over 2,400 police agencies&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; — to identify suspects. In the aftermath of the Capitol riots this January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;Clearview AI said the use of its technology by law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; sharply increased as detectives worked to identify those associated with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6h4Rt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last year for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, resulting in Clearview &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stopping the sale of its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and non-law enforcement entities. In November, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete"&gt;Australian government ordered the company&lt;/a&gt; to clear its database of all its citizens, and earlier this year, a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;European agencies filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against Clearview AI. In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canadian privacy commissioner called the company’s technology&lt;/a&gt; “illegal mass surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUmOgV"&gt;Clearview AI hasn’t even been able to get on Big Tech’s good side. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;Facebook, LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/clearview-ai-twitter-letter.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124172/youtube-clearview-ai-cease-and-desist"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; all sent cease and desist letters demanding that the company stop scraping images and videos from the platforms, as the practice is in violation of each site’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0QMR5m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is there any way out of Clearview’s facial recognition database?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s in-store Gamer Drop will be a bust if you’re looking for new consoles like the PS5 or Switch OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rt0PYBOnRxkLcojJ-czXOIwglQI=/0x24:672x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224897/k2__dd3aea10_166c_434f_9b7f_7b3287ed4b4e.v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s Gamer Drop prominently features the big three new consoles that are difficult to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEHRxJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 5th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per &lt;/em&gt;IGN’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TayNixster/status/1467245203283140617"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and an updated message on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart Gamer Drop splash page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the event won’t have the new consoles you’re probably looking for, despite featuring them prominently in the artwork. The post below has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8XU9j"&gt;Walmart has announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop event&lt;/a&gt; coming to select stores on December 11th, where the retailer is promising to have the “latest gaming titles and consoles.” It’s billing it as a holiday shopping event, complete with discounts and exclusive gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prXoF1"&gt; &lt;a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-4866/k2-_331621d6-7642-4095-82d1-ecac1d3f3bc9.v1.pdf"&gt;The posted circular on Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt; prominently features the major consoles, including the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, Xbox Series X / S, and both models of the PlayStation 5 with the note of “Available in-store or online at &lt;a href="http://Walmart.com/GamerDrop"&gt;Walmart.com/GamerDrop.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBT87C"&gt;After the event was announced, Walmart added more text to the notice (you can see the original one in the image below), informing gamers that “PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch OLED will not be available during this event.” It’s unclear whether or not they will have any Xbox Series X consoles on hand, but if there are, then the notice says you will only be able to purchase them as part of an All Access subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jolFad"&gt;This event is exclusive to select Walmart stores. You can find the closest Walmart that’s participating in the Gamer Drop event on Saturday, the 11th, by searching your address or zip code on the &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop&lt;/a&gt; page. Listed stores indicate Gamer Drop hours of 10:30AM to 7PM, which is a limited window compared to store hours of many Walmart stores. We have reached out to Walmart for further details and will keep an eye out for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>The Verizon app might be collecting your browsing history and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTuYkY79miGTm3dxd_vXfaWPL7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231632/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0UWrO"&gt;The My Verizon app might be collecting information about your browsing history, location, apps, and your contacts, all in the name of helping the company “understand your interests,” first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/verizon-customers-might-want-to-check-their-privacy-settings-asap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program, which Verizon appears to automatically opt customers into, is called Verizon Custom Experience and lays buried in the privacy settings on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEtwFY"&gt;The program introduces two different options that appear in the app, Custom Experience and Custom Experience Plus, each of which varies in terms of invasiveness. Verizon provides additional information about both settings within the app, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; on its website. It appears that the Custom Experience option is a stripped-down version of Custom Experience Plus, and as Verizon states directly in the app, it helps Verizon “personalize” its “communication with you” and “give you more relevant product and service recommendations” by using “information about websites you visit and apps you use on your mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUQBfA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Verizon's "Custom Experience" and "Custom Experience Plus" settings appear to let the company collect your device location, phone numbers you call, and your browsing history. Via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inputmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inputmag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv"&gt;https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/M4CHchHmZi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M4CHchHmZi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emma Roth (@emroth08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emroth08/status/1467549460075094023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksz12I"&gt;Meanwhile, Custom Experience Plus has the same purpose — to help Verizon provide you with a more “personalized” experience. However, it not only uses information about the websites and apps you use on your mobile device, but it also says it uses your “device location,” along with “phone numbers you call or that call you” to help Verizon “better understand your interests.” This also includes your CPNI, which tracks the times and duration of your calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4sKvUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8S3iG"&gt;As Verizon explains on its site, it might use your information to, say, present you with an offer that includes music content, or give you a music-related option in its Verizon Up reward program if it knows you like music. Verizon explicitly states that you “must opt in to participate and you can change your choice at any time,” but it doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in themselves, or perhaps they’re doing so unknowingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ToCtG"&gt;After checking the privacy settings on my own app, I found that “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus” were both already toggled on. I don’t recall ever turning either of these features on, or being asked about it. As Andrew Paul of &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt; notes, he only discovered the feature after mistakenly opening a promotional email from Verizon that describes the new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xx4PS9"&gt;To opt-out of the Custom Experience altogether, open your My Verizon app, and then hit the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Scroll down and select “Manage privacy settings” beneath the “Preferences” heading. On the next page, toggle off “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus.” To erase the information that Verizon has already collected about you through the program, tap “Custom Experience Settings,” and hit “Reset.” The company says that it won’t sell your information to advertisers and that it will “use it only for Verizon purposes,” but it’s still unnerving either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV3HkK"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers"&gt;T-Mobile started automatically enrolling users&lt;/a&gt; in a program that shares your data with advertisers unless you manually opt-out from your &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F5%2F22818783%2Fverizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/full_privacy_policy.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s privacy center&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that it collects web and browsing information, along with the apps you use, and that you can manage these settings from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/rights_choices.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Station Eleven, The Matrix Resurrections, The Book of Boba Fett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8egd3nYkAzv2HWHDWnLYtryjwo=/284x0:1592x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231469/mackenzie_davis_station_eleven_two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mackenzie Davis stars in Station Eleven | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaAG-SwEa7k&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6lf8U"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, and even though it meandered a lot, I found myself wanting more. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’&lt;/em&gt;s Jason Gay &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-miss-my-new-best-friends-the-beatles-11638543379?st=0mjtpkgws5h1pit&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;nicely captures what it felt like&lt;/a&gt; to watch this 50-year old footage as a fan, like we were all kinda just hanging out with John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they worked on new material. Highly recommend watching, it will make you question some of the prevailing narratives about the Fab Four (like the widely held belief that they were at each other’s throats constantly as the band neared its breakup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk8hn5"&gt;Also! We got some late-breaking news Saturday about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:  Into the Spider-Verse. &lt;/em&gt;It’s going to be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will actually be a two-parter, with part one to be released October 2022, and part two following in 2023. Hit that link for the first trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2xh02y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C8pqve"&gt;The rest of this week’s trailers include a new peeks at a few movies and shows we’ve seen previous trailers and teasers for, and a (fictional) new HBO Max series about people living in a post-pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6EoPs9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaAG-SwEa7k?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JAa7dl"&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TDk3sf"&gt;Based on the Emily St. John Mandel novel, &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the aftermath of a pandemic whose production was delayed by the real-world pandemic. Twenty years after most of the population was wiped out by the Georgia flu, a band of performers travels the post-apocalyptic landscape staging performances and encountering all manner of survivors including a mysterious person known as The Prophet. (One glimpse of a “museum of civilization” shows a display of some 21st-century relics including “the internet”, a “Switch, Nintendo,” and a “car key fob”). We see both the Before and After Times mainly through the eyes of Kristen, who was a child actress at the onset of the flu and is played by Mackenzie Davis as an adult. Himesh Patel, David Wilmot, Nabhaan Rizwan, Daniel Zovatto, Lori Petty and Matilda Lawler star in &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt;, which begins its 10-episode run December 16th on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tkKri9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgYs_NDyaLs?rel=0&amp;amp;start=60" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uuJiQz"&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l8BVVu"&gt;I did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; review/appreciation for this trailer the day it came out and have watched it a few (OK many) times since. We don’t get a lot more insight into the movie’s plot here, except that a main element will be “change.” We do hear a voiceover mention that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,” and I hope the movie rolls with this idea! Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christina Ricci, and Jada Pinkett Smith star in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters and HBO Max December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TtNOOi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCAlNWNbN5c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="57TlAX"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X4KDVW"&gt;“I am Boba Fett, left for dead on the sands of Tatooine” this new teaser begins. We see our protagonist submerged in what looks like a &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacta_tank"&gt;Bacta tank&lt;/a&gt; with a breathing apparatus attached to his face, likely explaining what happened to him post-Sarlacc ingestion in &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; (but not how he actually got out). A few characters look surprised to see Boba in this (very brief) new teaser titled “Message.” Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen star in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BS5ly"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHXq62VCaCM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XEW1qb"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XNt4ox"&gt;We got a teaser in October, and now we have a full trailer for the eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series. John Cena reprises his role from James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;(Gunn also created the &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series and wrote and directed most of its episodes), but he’s teamed up here with a new bunch of oddballs to try to keep the peace by assassinating people who are supposedly threats to the US. We see in the trailer that despite his bravado Peacemaker seems to question what he’s really doing and why. Along with Cena, Robert Patrick, Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, Steve Agee, Jennifer Holland, and Chukwudi Iwuji star in &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UsXJBB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkV2_4ZsqAQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8aaE7e"&gt;Studio 666&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W8QtU0"&gt;The premise of this horror/comedy flick: The Foo Fighters are recording a new album in a haunted mansion and some evil and bloody hijinks ensue. We don’t get a whole lot of clues about the plot, but we see Dave Grohl get the demon eyes and start levitating, along with glimpses of monsters, an ostensibly evil book, and other supernatural staples of horror flicks. It looks silly and fun as hell. Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett, and Rami Jaffee, along with Whitney Cummings, Leslie Grossman, and Will Forte star in &lt;em&gt;Studio 666&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An interactive Doja Cat music video can introduce you to programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZmcFaepP24sNNY_r1haTHYAxr4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231226/doja_code_woman_music_video.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Doja Cat codable music video. | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dojacode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Girls Who Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4RMua"&gt;Girls Who Code, the nonprofit organization that aims to get more women and girls interested in the field of computer science, has debuted what it calls the “first ever” codable music video. The organization partnered with Doja Cat, transforming her new music video for &lt;em&gt;Woman&lt;/em&gt; into an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fS40l4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HUGE NEWS: We just made the first ever codable music video with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DojaCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dojacat&lt;/a&gt;. You can control the story using code   Go try it now at &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgVStNr5om"&gt;https://t.co/EgVStNr5om&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dojacode?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#dojacode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q2MQhMDd0s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q2MQhMDd0s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Girls Who Code (@GirlsWhoCode) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GirlsWhoCode/status/1466784319846944771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDVREX"&gt;You can try out the experience for yourself at &lt;a href="https://dojacode.com/"&gt;Dojacode.com&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll be greeted by a futuristic image of Doja Cat that becomes pixelated as you drag your mouse over the screen. On the next page, you’ll see three stars, each of which represents a different programming language — yellow for CSS; blue for Javascript; and pink for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg7bkg"&gt;Once you click the music video, the experience begins. It plays just like Doja Cat’s original music video, only you’ll get to make decisions throughout, sort of like a choose your own adventure game, but with code. The timeline on the bottom of the screen contains four color-coded stars, showing when the video will pause and which programming language will be showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnCMJ4PtLW_BR5OKDMkhkLGuLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23064505/doja_code_video_nails.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Emma Roth / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Typing in a color changes the look of Doja Cat’s nails.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrJrz"&gt;When the video stops, you’ll be able to fill in the blanks besides lines of code. For example, the first break lets you change the color of Doja Cat’s nails using CSS; the color you type in alters the color of Doja Cat’s nails in real-time. In another scenario, entering the name of a city changes the time of day in the video, and it even stays true to that location’s current time — after I typed in “Tokyo” at around 10:00AM ET, the sky in the video turned dark and constellations became visible, all in line with Tokyo’s 12:00AM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtHBxF"&gt;At the end of the experience, you’ll get snapshots of how each area looked after you finished “coding” it, which the site then lets you download or share to social media. While the DojaCode video doesn’t involve any intense amounts of programming, I still found it fun to experiment with typing in different options and seeing my changes instantly take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite: Chapter 3 is now live with new island, Spider-Man, and plenty more changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-1PfRxJvbR_4SbZkk8nvk0VbWU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230178/19BR_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TexQAX"&gt;And then there were three. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;a dramatic live event on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is moving on to Chapter 3, which introduces some big changes for the battle royale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7Bbec"&gt;This morning developer Epic launched &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-3-season-1"&gt;season 1&lt;/a&gt; of the new chapter, called “Flipped,” and the most dramatic change is the shift to a fresh, snow-covered island, one that features weather conditions, along with new locations like Sanctuary — which appears to play a large part in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore — and the Daily Bugle. Those who pick up the new battle pass will also be able to get their hands on characters like Spider-Man and (eventually) The Foundation, voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. You can get the full run-down of the battle pass right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="94buvi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/knAYcg7Tt8E?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPD4Fk"&gt;(It’s been a busy weekend for spider-news, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"&gt;a trailer for the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; also dropping&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYvIt7"&gt;It also appears that the core gameplay will be shaken up quite a bit. Chapter 3 features two new mechanics — sliding and swinging — that could make the experience even faster and more vertical, particularly for high-level players. And for those who spend time in the game’s creative mode, there’s now an option to earn battle pass XP in player-made experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDrIdT"&gt;Outside of that, developer Epic is introducing some persistent elements to the game. Here’s how the studio explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hD9tXF"&gt;This new chapter brings camps, where players and their squad can heal and store items from match to match — bringing new persistent, social gameplay options to&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, there are new weapons and items to help win a victory royale and earn the all-new, ultimate prestige — the Victory Crown. Keep winning to keep the crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmcw69"&gt;Many of these details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;leaked out earlier on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of an intense live event that saw the previous island literally flip over. After that the game went down for hours as players stared at their characters adrift in a vast ocean. Once the downtime was over, players washed up on the shore of the new island before getting a pep talk from The Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcpqea"&gt;You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;our full recap&lt;/a&gt; of the event right here, or watch it all in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uAoyWR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Rasl5UwwNY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjiVOi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;a surprise black hole event&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly led to an all-new island. It spanned eight seasons that included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Marvel superhero takeover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJ3kCT"&gt;eBay inadvertently suspended an unspecified number of users on December 3rd. The platform has since acknowledged the incident, noting that users who were accidentally suspended have received a notification so they can resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJl2ko"&gt;Users across social media began reporting that they’ve been suspended from eBay on Friday, despite not knowingly breaking any rules on the platform. An &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/ebay_is_apparently_going_on_a_suspending_spree_if/"&gt;entire Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; on r/ebay is dedicated to the issue, and although the original post has since been deleted, dozens of other users have added their own experiences to the thread. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4m6pp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;One user&lt;/a&gt; describes their own account of the situation, much of which is echoed by other comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XZ5Ywp"&gt;Suspended tonight with no chance of appeal, did an online chat and the woman just told me it wouldn’t be discussed and then cut me off. Member since 1999, 100% positive, haven’t sold anything for years, no disputes, have bought 5 small items over the last month with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs2k29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5fda1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5bs7u/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; claim that eBay canceled their bids on products that they’ve already purchased and received, some of which were “Buy It Now” items, which users can buy outright. As for the justification for these bans, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5e4j3/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4pirc/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they got an email from the company saying that they put “the eBay community at risk.” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4simb/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn50mei/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; allege that when they contacted eBay’s customer service about it, their bans were upheld, and no further information was given to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rSeIjb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended. The issue is resolved &amp;amp; any users who need to take action have been notified. If you still need help, please DM your name, email &amp;amp; zip so we can check it out. ~Beca  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr"&gt;https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ask eBay (@AskeBay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskeBay/status/1467223956168052738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zCV4MI"&gt;Outside of Reddit, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSteeplejack/status/1466869336732311552?s=20"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zebulooon/status/1466772689499086853?s=20"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Onioncakes1/status/1466902427102179329?s=20"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; also complained of the seemingly random suspensions that took place on the 3rd. The next day, eBay responded to some of the reports, noting that users can DM the @AskeBay Twitter account with their information to sort out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJwxag"&gt;“On December 3rd, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended,” said eBay spokesperson Trina Somera in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The issue has been resolved and any users who need to take action have been notified. We regret any concern this may have caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g28jkJ"&gt;Although eBay has acknowledged the issue, we still don’t know how many users were accidentally suspended, as well as why this occurred. However, we can speculate that the mass suspensions might’ve been caused by some kind of error with eBay’s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSuGUZhbcNjXJz00BK8RRzS-DnU=/460x0:1972x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229604/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_7.59.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAreQb"&gt;The first trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to the animated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just dropped, revealing both the title — &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;— and the surprise that the upcoming adventures of Miles Morales will actually be a two-part affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojuIL"&gt;The first-look trailer picks up right where the last Spider-Verse movie left off: with Miles (Shameik Moore) lying in bed, before a portal to Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and her universe opens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXCqdb"&gt;From there, it seems like &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;is going to be trying to one-up the already stellar animation of the original film, with Miles bouncing across multiple animated universes in a variety of art styles as he dukes it out with Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac, who voiced the character in the post-credit scene of the first movie.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GoqE05H4JRnpDK541_WdnxGZ_u0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063667/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_8.14.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oEFYAZ"&gt;According to the official description, the upcoming sequel will “transport Brooklyn’s full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OloYN"&gt;Sony isn’t saying who that villain is (although it’s possible the movie could draw on the 2014 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; comic crossover, which saw the multiverse’s Spider-People under attack from Morlun and the Inheritors), although whatever the threat is, it appears that it couldn’t be contained to just a single film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QExGhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One)&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on October 7th, 2022, with Part Two set to follow sometime in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
