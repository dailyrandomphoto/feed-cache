    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service grows to 25 million subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQf2LQ"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/18/welcoming-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-gaming/"&gt;now has 25 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. That’s up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;18 million&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft previously reported in January last year. The Xbox Game Pass all-you-can-eat catalog of downloadable games — or the “Netflix for video games” as it’s often described — continues to attract new subscribers as Microsoft looks to extend the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD40Dc"&gt;As Microsoft’s subscriber numbers grow, so does the amount of titles available on Xbox Game Pass. In 2021, Xbox Game Pass added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;iconic Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 in total on the service, including &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnYwXZ"&gt;Microsoft announced the milestone while revealing its planned $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which will have Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and its 10,000 employees reporting to Phil Spencer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geCOEE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5zc14j"&gt;The acquisition also bolsters Microsoft’s Game Pass portfolio with plans to launch Activision Blizzard games into Game Pass, which has reached a new milestone of over 25 million subscribers. With Activision Blizzard’s nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and three billion-dollar franchises, this acquisition will make Game Pass one of the most compelling and diverse lineups of gaming content in the industry. Upon close, Microsoft will have 30 internal game development studios, along with additional publishing and esports production capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b08X7q"&gt;Spencer said in a blog post that “we will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog.” There are no specifics, but with the Warcraft, Call of Duty, Diablo, and Candy Crush brands to choose from — to name a few — the service will have a lot of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GTG23"&gt;Microsoft has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311265/xbox-game-pass-nba-2k21-madden-nfl-21-nhl-21-ea-pass"&gt;chasing sports fans&lt;/a&gt; over the past year with the addition of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NHL 21&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;also debuted on Xbox Game Pass last year, and Microsoft added &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; to the service over the summer. Microsoft also had a big Xbox Game Pass holiday, with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;launching day one on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7hjpy"&gt;Microsoft has also been working on extending where Xbox Game Pass is available, thanks to Xbox Game Streaming. A web version of Xbox Cloud Gaming (formerly Project xCloud) was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;made widely available&lt;/a&gt; to players on iOS and PC last summer, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;Microsoft started rolling the service out to Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; in November. This will allow newer games, like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, to be streamed and played on older Xbox consoles too, as the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;fully powered by Xbox Series X hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 SE laptops arrive to take on Chromebooks in schools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eU7gGk1OCYeFGMW2RPR8tL33Jnw=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403262/WIN22_Hybrid_Learning_11SE_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tNJqHL"&gt;Microsoft’s Chrome OS competitor, Windows 11 SE, is making its way onto a handful of laptops. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771742/microsoft-windows-11-se-features-release-date"&gt;detailing Windows 11 SE in November&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s OEM partners are now starting to make devices available globally for schools and students. Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Lenovo, HP, and JP.IK have all created Windows 11 SE laptops, with devices from Fujitsu and Positivo arriving later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8sSuu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771742/microsoft-windows-11-se-features-release-date"&gt;Windows 11 SE&lt;/a&gt; will only be available on new low-cost devices and only for schools and education customers. It’s designed to really take on Chromebooks in education, and is optimized for Microsoft Edge, Office, and Microsoft’s cloud-based services. Windows 11 SE isn’t limited to just Microsoft apps though, with both Zoom and Chrome part of an authorized selection of apps that IT admins can install. Microsoft has also simplified Windows 11 SE so apps always run fullscreen, multitasking using Snap Layouts has been reduced to side-by-side only, and the Widgets section has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXW4fqWY5BBIyQodmo1_d-MwF0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23176451/xYJ29Id.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Windows 11 SE laptop includes stylus support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7waCdx"&gt;In terms of hardware, a variety of laptops will be available in the coming weeks. Most OEMs seem to be repurposing existing low-cost devices to ship with Windows 11 SE preinstalled. Acer is updating its existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fprofessional-series%2Ftravelmatespinb3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889184%2Fwindows-11-se-laptops-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo-education-schools" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TravelMate Spin B3 laptop&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 SE. The 11.6-inch device includes shock-absorbent bumpers to protect against drops and even drainage nearly the keyboard for spillages. Intel Pentium Silver or Celeron processors will power the TravelMate Spin B3, which are fairly common processor choices among Windows 11 SE laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQuIc2"&gt;Asus has its own wonderfully named &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FLaptops%2FFor-Students%2FAll-series%2FASUS-BR1100F%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889184%2Fwindows-11-se-laptops-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo-education-schools" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BR1100F laptop&lt;/a&gt; that includes a 360-degree hinge, a touchscreen display with stylus support, and a rubber bumper and spill-resistant keyboard. Dell has opted for an 11-inch display on its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-3120-education/spd/latitude-11-3120-2-in-1-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Latitude 3120 laptops&lt;/a&gt;, with a quick charging feature that lets owners get around 80 percent charge in an hour. That’s useful in schools where trying to keep devices charged is half the struggle with laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbXnYl"&gt;Dynabook (known previously as Toshiba) is shipping Windows 11 SE on its existing &lt;a href="https://us.dynabook.com/computers-tablets/laptops/e-series/e10"&gt;E10 laptop series&lt;/a&gt;, with an 11.6-inch HD display, Intel Celeron processors, and solid stage storage. The keyboard is spill-resistant and this compact laptop is designed to easily fit inside backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KRxmg8gFB0qisd7TQpmwNCOBS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23176450/QpvNLav.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP has one of the only larger Windows 11 SE laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r2mqAJ"&gt;HP’s new ProBook Fortis 14-inch G9 Notebook is one of the only Windows 11 SE laptops with a larger display. The 14-inch device includes an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, and 128GB SSD. HP also has a smaller 11-inch Pro x360 model that’s powered by Windows 11 SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3xEA0"&gt;JP IK’s Windows 11 SE laptop starts at just $219. The Leap T304 has an 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, and even a rotatable 2-megapixel webcam. Lenovo is also repurposing its &lt;a href="https://techtoday.lenovo.com/gb/en/solutions/education"&gt;existing 100w, 300w, 500w, and 14w laptops&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxWodE"&gt;“Our partners are building a broad portfolio of Windows 11 SE devices that are now starting to become available globally,” says Nicole Dezen, corporate vice president of device partner sales at Microsoft. “There are many more Windows 11 SE devices coming this year, including releases from Fujitsu and Positivo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJzek"&gt;Microsoft has also created its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771778/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-features-price-release-date"&gt;$249 Surface Laptop SE&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first true Chromebook competitor. The Surface Laptop SE will be sold exclusively to schools and students when it’s available early this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Women who drive for Uber and Lyft are being left to fend for themselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggIOOUw9yklvR_t-_SPylwjsHGE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403313/VRG_ILLO_4949_K_Radtke_Rideshare_Assault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Two dozen women drivers speak out about their experiences with sexual assault and harassment &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6KUOVp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this story contains descriptions of sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPu2NO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this story, last names have been omitted to protect the identities of these women and in some cases, the names have been changed for privacy reasons. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Kg44WC"&gt;Tara, a former elementary school English teacher who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, had been driving for Uber for about two years when she had her first distressing experience with a customer. Late one night, several years ago, she picked up a male passenger outside of a bar. A few minutes into the ride, the man suddenly unzipped his pants and exposed himself to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e0YnO"&gt;Tara said that she reported the passenger to Uber. The rideshare company assured her that she would not be paired with that rider again, but said nothing about his ability to use the app in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6DLKc"&gt;Several months later, Tara was outside the same bar in Charleston, waiting for a surge in requests with some other female drivers. They were talking, and she told them what had happened. To her surprise, both women told her that they had recently picked up the same passenger, weeks after Tara said she had reported him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OB4r18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;both women told her that they had recently picked up the same passenger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hPR563"&gt;Tara’s story is not uncommon. In interviews with over 25 female rideshare drivers across the country, their experiences vary, from having passengers flirt with them, solicit them for sex, or making unwanted advances toward them. Many said they have taken to carrying pepper spray or other defensive weapons in their vehicles in defiance of the app company’s policies banning such items. All of the drivers said that they do not feel completely protected or supported by the companies on whose platforms they conduct their business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sDXCO"&gt;“It just feels like they don’t care about our safety,” said one driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vj93KJ"&gt;Earlier this year,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740609/lyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death"&gt; Lyft released its first-ever safety reports&lt;/a&gt;d, which revealed&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740609/lyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death"&gt; 4,000 sexual assault claims&lt;/a&gt; from 2017–2019. Similarly, in 2019,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt; Uber released its safety report&lt;/a&gt;, which showed just over 3,000 sexual assault claims from 2017–2018. (Uber hasn’t released an update in three years.) Around half of these claims &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/7/20998646/uber-safety-report-sexual-assault-lyft-cases"&gt;came from drivers&lt;/a&gt;, who alleged that they were victims of sexual assault from their passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0zHb3"&gt;Over the last few years, most of the attention has been on passenger safety, prompting Uber and Lyft to roll out more safety measures for their customers. Both companies are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;currently facing multiple lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-sued-for-allegedly-failing-to-prevent-womans-sexual-assault-2020-9"&gt;from female customers&lt;/a&gt; who allege Uber and Lyft have failed to protect them from rape or assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFkIG0"&gt;Currently, new drivers on both Uber and Lyft have to undergo detailed background checks before being authorized to drive. Both drivers and customers now have access to an in-app panic button that automatically contacts a 911 dispatcher and shares the caller’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocUYCl"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/07/uber-mandatory-sexual-misconduct-assault-driver-training-u-s-canada/"&gt;Uber announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to require all new drivers in the US and Canada to complete sexual assault and misconduct training as a part of the companies’ partnership with RAINN, a national anti-sexual assault organization — a big step in regards to passenger safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcZqxH"&gt;But many drivers say these efforts still aren’t enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7T3uI"&gt;“They don’t do enough when a driver is assaulted,” said Michelle Dottin, a driver and advocate. “Safety, in general, should be for everyone. It shouldn’t be one-sided, and the way that these companies do it, it feels more one-sided — they don’t really worry as much about their drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mFgUiz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Safety, in general, should be for everyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnIAh"&gt;In 2019,&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-lyft-driver-arizona-stabbed-death-passenger-police-say-n963766"&gt; a pregnant Lyft driver in Arizona, 39-year-old Kristina Howato, was fatally stabbed by a passenger,&lt;/a&gt; reigniting conversations regarding driver safety. But two years later, many female drivers say that they don’t feel that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5wHhB"&gt;Passengers are not currently required to complete background checks or sexual misconduct training before making an account. Despite making it safer for drivers, enforcing these additional measures could slow down the sign-up process, which rideshare companies tout as a central, seamless feature of their service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys6T2D"&gt;As it stands, there is no identity verification needed for passengers unless they are paying with a gift card or prepaid card. Riders can technically still use fake names or their friend’s accounts, making them harder to identify and track down if a report is made against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xwULZ"&gt;Rideshare drivers are legally classified as independent contractors, so they lack the protections available to regular employees. Everything from company-provided equipment such as dashboard cameras to the right to collective bargaining for better working conditions is denied to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hCsmc"&gt;Many drivers appreciate the freedom and flexibility that contract work allows but become frustrated when they feel unsupported by the companies — especially when it comes to safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EMQ06"&gt;A few months after the first incident occurred, Tara recalls driving a group of drunk men back to a golf resort in Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwRhHP"&gt;After making several stops, she had one man left to drop off. He was sitting in the front seat, she remembered, still intoxicated and still flirting with her, as he had been for the entire ride. He noticed that Tara was reading Stephen King’s “It,” which was placed on the dashboard. She was on page 262.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y6y19"&gt;“You must be smart if you’re reading Stephen King,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcTK2o"&gt;Tara ignored him and drove cautiously to his destination. She waited for him to get out of the car. But then, according to Tara, the man began making advances towards her. She resisted. He grabbed her keys from the ignition. She honked the car horn, hoping that someone would hear, and as she reached for the car door, he slapped her hand. Tara froze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKFVTc"&gt;Out of nowhere, the passenger’s friends reappeared and took him back to the hotel. After they were gone, Tara remembers sobbing in her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGBFfH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He was very drunk, so I was lucky”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6pNP5"&gt;“He was very drunk, so I was lucky. If he hadn’t been as drunk, he would have raped me,” she said, thinking back to that night. “He made me feel weak; I still feel weak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28c6FS"&gt;Tara said that she never reported it to Uber or the local police. She had made several reports against passengers in the past but contends that she was left disappointed by the lack of action from both Uber and local law enforcement. She assumed that reporting this incident would again amount to nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj3SNW"&gt;Tara says that she has an audio recording of the incident but has never given it to law enforcement or Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2zhyV"&gt;To this day, the bookmark in Stephen King’s “It” is still on page 262. After what happened, she couldn’t bring herself to finish the book.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RdAsOK"&gt;One of the realities of gig work is the trade-off between flexibility and protection. Many female drivers are mothers and value the ability to set their own schedules. But they say that the lack of safety measures limits the flexibility that drew them to the work in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GPSdU"&gt;Choosing whether or not to drive at night is a decision that many female drivers face. The demand is higher at night, so they can make more money, but they are more likely to encounter inappropriate or threatening passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZLeYf"&gt;Around 21 percent of &lt;a href="https://gridwise.io/who-are-rideshare-drivers-a-demographic-breakdown-of-rideshare-drivers-in-the-u-s"&gt;Lyft drivers&lt;/a&gt; and 27 percent of &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf"&gt;Uber drivers&lt;/a&gt; in the US are women. Nearly half of the women interviewed for this story said that they do not drive at night for safety reasons. But for some, driving at night is essential in order to make a living as there is more money to be made, and many drivers interviewed also have day jobs, so they are only able to drive at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpfQP"&gt;“There are also women who only pick up at the airports or in certain neighborhoods,” said Moira Muntz, spokesperson for the Independent Drivers Guild, a driver-led advocacy group. “But that limits their income, as they spend a lot more time waiting between pickups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fauqWm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nearly half of the women said that they do not drive at night &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Mn8Wg"&gt;The Independent Drivers Guild is currently advocating for more passenger verification, background checks, and subsidized in-vehicle cameras, among other measures focused on making conditions safer for drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNOPWi"&gt;Susan, 58, is a Lyft driver in Houston, Texas. She mainly drives at night as there is less traffic and higher demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7P7Ay"&gt;Around two years ago, Susan said that she picked up a male passenger from a club in Houston. During the ride, she claims that he propositioned her for sex and kept offering her money for sexual favors. She declined multiple times and drove a little faster to the destination. They were right around the corner from his house, so the incident did not escalate further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFNsxy"&gt;Susan said that she reported this passenger, and though she could not locate a copy of the two-year-old report, she remembers receiving a message from Lyft saying that they had unpaired her with this passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwaLrJ"&gt;“All they say is, ‘Oh, sorry that this happened to you, we’ll make sure you never get a ride with him again. And we’ll investigate this.’ But we never know what’s gonna happen because they don’t ever tell us,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0rZ4ME"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He had a different name this time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FrBV13"&gt;Earlier this year, two years after she originally picked up that passenger, Susan said that she accepted a ride and was driving to the passenger’s pick-up point when she received a message from the rider. She recalled that the message said that he did not need a ride after all but that instead, he began offering her money for sexual favors. Susan looked at the address again and realized that it was the same man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDcd7K"&gt;“He had a different name this time. But when I drove up, I remembered the address right where I dropped him off,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG79K9"&gt;Susan said that she immediately canceled the ride. She continues to be frustrated at how the passenger had been able to make a new account with a different name despite having been reported in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITcGRA"&gt;“He is probably still out there doing the same thing,” said Susan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oy92v7"&gt;Some female drivers take it upon themselves to find ways to pre-empt passengers from doing anything inappropriate or unsafe. The tactics range from putting music on to avoid conversation to forgoing makeup and wearing baggy clothes so they don’t come across as “too attractive.” Several drivers even wear fake wedding rings and tell their passengers that their partners work in law enforcement, even if it’s untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wECFGE"&gt;“Men will always respect other men more than women,” said one driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLsDiu"&gt;Dashboard cameras are another tool that can help a driver feel safer. But these can cost anywhere from $100–$400, often more than a day’s income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WOpWD"&gt;“When a rider sees a dashcam, their behavior changes, it makes a difference,” said driver advocate Michelle Dottin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqlgTu"&gt;Many women admitted to carrying some type of weapon in their cars for protection, from pepper spray and wasp spray to tasers and knives — often going against company policy, such as Lyft’s “No Weapons” policy. Uber has a similar policy, their website states that riders and drivers are “prohibited from carrying firearms or weapons of any kind (e.g., knives, tasers) while using the Uber apps, to the extent permitted by applicable law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntM1aJ"&gt;Most of the women admitted to never having used the weapons they carry but explained that having them easily accessible is important when it comes to safety, especially considering the lack of screening for riders. For several drivers, the risk of being deactivated is overshadowed by the importance of protecting themselves from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aGaQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just turn on the taser real quick, and that pretty much calms them down”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9R026W"&gt;A driver from Houston, Texas, admitted that in the past, she has brandished a taser when dealing with male passengers who have persisted in making her feel uncomfortable, even after declining their advances multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXe0Jv"&gt;“I just turn on the taser real quick, and that pretty much calms them down,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giGBZ8"&gt;Others rely on significant others or family members who track them on their phones, which makes many drivers feel more protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdKd68"&gt;Uber and Lyft have long defended their safety measures with regard to their drivers and passengers. When approached for comment, Jodi Kawada Page, a spokesperson from Uber said that they are committed to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxDBJ3"&gt;“We remain steadfast in our commitment to safety,” said Page in an email. “We have pioneered new safety features, processes, and policies guided by experts and gender-based violence prevention advocates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlrGWK"&gt;Page went on to highlight many new features and policies that Uber has implemented in the last few years that are focused on passenger and driver safety. These include but are not limited to having launched a 24-7 dedicated survivor support hotline, an in-app emergency 911 button as well as educational videos, developed with RAINN, which are sent to riders and drivers when they receive a report of inappropriate behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erNP88"&gt;The spokesperson explained that Uber has recently implemented a system that prevents people who have been previously deactivated from making a new account by flagging fraud indicators such as similar data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBglZf"&gt;Last year, Uber announced their new rider verification system that asks some passengers for an extra level of verification. This feature only applies to passengers using anonymous forms of payment such as Venmo or a gift card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBH82s"&gt;Whatever their hours, rideshare driving can be a lonely profession, and lots of drivers gather in Facebook groups to get advice, share stories, and meet others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB5OuC"&gt;Allison, a Lyft driver in Austin, Texas, shared in one of the female-only drivers’ Facebook groups in November of 2021 that she had reported a passenger for making unwanted advances towards her. She explained that Lyft had emailed her and told her they had dealt with the passenger. But then, later that week, she said that they sent her another email saying they could not find the ride in question, leaving her unsure if she would pick him up again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWpR7s"&gt;She then said that she followed up with Lyft and provided them with additional information regarding the incident, but said that she never heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iRl7DG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are so vulnerable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXtWIO"&gt;“We are so vulnerable,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PK502f"&gt;Ashley Adams, a spokesperson from Lyft, said that safety is fundamental to their company and that they are constantly designing features and policies in an attempt to help make every Lyft ride safe. In the email, the spokesperson pointed to features such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634087/lyft-panic-button-911-app-riders-safety"&gt;in-app emergency help button &lt;/a&gt;as well as their 24/7 safety support line. (Both of these features have been well received by drivers across the country.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOMjLn"&gt;“While we do unpair riders and drivers who rate each other 3 stars or fewer, when we receive safety reports it is our policy to take additional action, which can include investigating internally, gathering additional information from riders and drivers, and deactivating the accounts used,” said Adams in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kI7f4E"&gt;In certain markets, Lyft said that they are working on ways to identify and take action against new and existing rider accounts that they determine to be high-risk. These include temporarily and permanently deactivating accounts, blocking users from creating new accounts, and requiring riders to submit additional information before requesting a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuAI5x"&gt;“Violence and harassment are not tolerated on the Lyft platform, and accounts of drivers or riders who engage in such behavior or otherwise violate our Community Guidelines are permanently removed from the platform,” Adams said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC2Rac"&gt;A few years ago, Tara created a local Facebook group for Myrtle Beach and Charleston drivers. Through it, she met Cathy, a 60-year-old former special education teacher, who was driving in the same area. They quickly became friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1S6bT0"&gt;Tara and Cathy began keeping an eye on each other throughout their rides. At the end of each work night, they would meet at a Walmart parking lot in Charleston to take naps before heading back to Myrtle Beach, about two hours away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4RJTEn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We had each other”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3E5up"&gt;“We had each other. If I were gone too long, she would call to ensure I was okay,” Tara explained. “And, you know, same for me if I didn’t hear from her for a while, I would call her and make sure everything was going okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXpkRF"&gt;They both stopped driving full-time recently but occasionally still take the wheel on busy days like Thanksgiving. They are still friends. Both Tara and Cathy hope that Uber and Lyft start doing a better job protecting their drivers, holding their passengers accountable, and getting better at responding to sensitive incidents, including sexual assault and harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10QdTW"&gt;Looking back, Tara said that she wished that she’d had Cathy during her first few years on the job but is grateful for the years that they were able to support each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="W8ICQC"&gt;“We were just two women from the same city who had to create a buddy system and keep track of each other to make sure we were safe,” she said. “We supported each other when Uber didn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vLhi0fC7du_N2HBXm1IjmOHK8g=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402797/activisionmicrosoft.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ScZIsQ"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Activision, the troubled publisher of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;. The deal will value Activision at $68.7 billion, far in excess of the $26 billion Microsoft paid to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13882622/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-finalized"&gt;acquire LinkedIn in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s Microsoft’s biggest push into gaming, and the company says it will be the “third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony” once the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaPJb7"&gt;Microsoft plans to add many of Activision’s games to Xbox Game Pass once the deal closes. With the acquisition of Activision, Microsoft will soon publish franchises like &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;. “Upon close, we will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog,” says Microsoft’s CEO of gaming Phil Spencer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZX6Pt"&gt;Xbox Game Pass now has 25 million subscribers, as Microsoft continues to acquire studios to boost the subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNQ6gk"&gt;Microsoft’s deal comes after months of sexual harassment claims against Activision Blizzard. Last July, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for promoting a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” More &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;employees have come forward&lt;/a&gt; with more allegations of sexual misconduct ever since, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;reached an $18 million settlement with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; in September. That settlement is being appealed, and reports indicate that nearly 40 Activision Blizzard employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22887855/activision-blizzard-employees-fired-sexual-harassment-misconduct-controversy"&gt;reportedly “exited” the company since last July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Um3Oer0FpTlm4MRSeckHuaOGIeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23176546/GLT_OrgChart.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new gaming org chart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7neYQ"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t detail exactly how it will approach solving these issues, and the company says Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard for now. It looks like Kotick won’t remain once the deal is fully closed and after the transition period to Microsoft, though. Phil Spencer, formerly head of gaming at Microsoft, is now CEO of Microsoft Gaming and the company says the Activision Blizzard business will report directly to Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttYNKr"&gt; “As a company, Microsoft is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players,” says Microsoft’s CEO of gaming Phil Spencer. “We deeply value individual studio cultures. We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mta1pm"&gt;Microsoft’s huge Activision Blizzard deal comes nearly a year after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;acquired Bethesda (ZeniMax Media) for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, that acquisition bolstered the company’s first-party Xbox game studios to a total of 23, and was seen as a huge boost for Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQj6r0bHP5nOrtxHEULCvRhhAGc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66922524/VRG_ILL_4947_Zoom_secure_call.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Becca Farsace&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Remember last summer, when things were starting to open up and Omicron was just a Greek letter you found in crossword puzzles? Yeah, me too. But now, many of us are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCcs6d"&gt;There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats. We’ve left them out because they require that all participants be members of a specific social network (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime, which is Apple-only). We’ve also tried to concentrate on applications that allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host), and that allow at least 10 or more participants on their free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8yIwt"&gt;A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and that of your friends. This list is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6libON"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LQuFKh"&gt;The most popular video meeting app&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5zsGsMM_zzRUfccXF_2EdkoflI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_1.20.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CYiJpA"&gt;Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps — in fact, its name is quickly becoming synonymous with video meetings. Before the pandemic hit, the company pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it also provides a free basic version for individuals. At first, because Zoom didn’t expect its sudden popularity among non-business users, there were several missteps involving privacy and security; the company quickly instituted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230962/zoom-update-security-privacy-features-improvements-download"&gt;a number of changes and updates&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nndg"&gt;The free version of Zoom allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which can be pretty limiting. At the time of publication, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fcovid19.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering help and advice&lt;/a&gt; to new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BYNFVw"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHNl6l"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b91yn2"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 30-hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JIlwSK"&gt;Group meetings: 40-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XpI4G1"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kF9xF4"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FqBb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; Meet Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StW6sf"&gt;A longtime go-to for online calls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOsT4"&gt;Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since its beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows for videoconferencing; up to 100 people (including you) can meet with a generous 24-hour time limit on meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB02lU"&gt;There is also a separate page that lets you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Ffree-conference-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;create a free video meeting&lt;/a&gt; without having to actually sign up for the service. However, you get more features using the app, so if you’re okay with registering for a free account, you’re better off doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FQrF4L"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lgPZGp"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcIFOJ"&gt;Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ’90s, and was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a &lt;a href="https://cart.webex.com/sign-up-webex?experienceType=Unified&amp;amp;ft=selfsignup"&gt;fairly generous free version&lt;/a&gt; that’s worth checking out. During the current pandemic, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, and you can meet for up to 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iVgdLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B6FO7y"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet is a video calling option that requires Google accounts to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msl2WU"&gt;Meet offers a very simple and efficient way to video chat with colleagues, friends, and family — assuming they all have Google accounts, which is a requirement for both hosts and participants. In fact, Google is not only pushing people to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;its Meet videoconferencing app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom, but also instead of its own previously pushed Google Hangouts app. You can find a Meet link in the Gmail app and in every appointment you make using Google Calendar. And Meet has some neat features, including real-time captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v1Sc5Q"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ndFlQU"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0gleS7"&gt;Not just for business&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e6cKl0CUoE2ruyM1Bb3kGununBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489400/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.58.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="celGBu"&gt;Microsoft Teams was built as a competitor to Slack and is an especially good idea if you’re part of the Office ecosystem. While the application is mainly focused on business use, Microsoft has stepped out of its three-piece suit and unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349783/microsoft-teams-texting-calls-videoconferencing-how-to"&gt;a free personal version of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone chat, talk, or have video meetings — you just have to create an account with Microsoft in order to use it. You can have up to 100 participants for a maximum of 60 minutes per meeting; you also get 5GB of OneDrive storage for files and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z7fDpG"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VPM1Xz"&gt;Maximum participants: Normally 100; extended to 300 during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3OY8iA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MaDoxu"&gt;Group meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OU4H3U"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lqJ1wZ"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdqxTy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duo.google.com/about/"&gt;Google Duo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdg4C0"&gt;A mobile app best suited to one-to-ones&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0KN9x"&gt;You don’t really expect Google to only offer one simple videoconferencing app, do you? Besides Google Meet, Google also has its mobile app Duo, which was built as a consumer app (whereas Meet was originally designed as a business app). While Duo was first touted as the app to use for one-to-one conversations and could only be used on phones, it now allows you to create groups of up to 32 participants and includes a web app. All participants must have Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrdSff"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aqu3zn"&gt;Maximum participants: 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k4gNud"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rd9Yef"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Tah4o"&gt;Screen sharing: Mobile only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdHECg"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSGznj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.starleaf.com/resources/remote-working-hub/"&gt;StarLeaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="05W8yJ"&gt;A corporate meeting app with a free basic version&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzst4"&gt;If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf. It’s really a platform for companies rather than individuals; its lowest-cost paid plan starts with one to nine licenses, suitable for a small business. But it also offers a basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWyY2P"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W5dlgk"&gt;Maximum participants: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hGcJD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gtv4JL"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uPfKjn"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gxuvie"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TzLjf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si/"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Zxxcw"&gt;Open source with plenty of features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYifcw"&gt;Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply going to the site and clicking on “Start meeting.” If you’re a developer, you can build your own conferencing app via &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/"&gt;Jitsi Videobridge&lt;/a&gt;, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as fake backgrounds, chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VhdHjO"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JlbkKB"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bN9uN0"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3n0cX0"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GpB4PM"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCwVWj"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEZRsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://whereby.com/"&gt;Whereby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0tRyD7"&gt;Single meeting rooms with up to 50 participants&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47xmn6lLGej9EWf2brZ_EXrP7f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489313/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.13.49_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3ZHs"&gt;Whereby’s free version gives you the use of a single meeting room with up to 50 participants, along with the ability to lock rooms (participants have to “knock” to gain entrance). Each room has its own URL that you get to choose, which is great — assuming that nobody else has already taken that name. (For example, I first tried &lt;a href="http://whereby.com/testroom"&gt;whereby.com/testroom&lt;/a&gt; and found it was already taken.) But it also has a chat function, lets you share a screen, allows you to mute or eject users, and offers breakout groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQQ6g6"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kgniVF"&gt;Maximum participants: 50	&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVdrv"&gt;RingCentral mainly sells business communications services, but also offers a free video meeting app called RingCentral Video Pro. The app includes a nice range of features, including 24 hours of meeting time, screen sharing, recordings (up to 10 hours and stored up to seven days), chat, and virtual backgrounds, among others. It even offers closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d0yA3C"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u3cQbc"&gt;Maximum participants: 100 &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spike can be used without having to download anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n46v"&gt;Spike, an expanding email service, offers paid group videoconferencing to its subscribers, but it has also made a basic video meeting web app available to anyone who wants it. It’s quick and easy to use: just go to &lt;a href="https://video.spike.chat/"&gt;video.spike.chat&lt;/a&gt;, type in a name, and click on “Join Video Chat Meeting.” Spike generates a unique URL for the chat and even lets you share your screen. And unlike most of the other services listed here, there is no maximum for participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zCfIFs"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3KJGq9"&gt;Maximum participants: No limit &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram has introduced group video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbKf3x"&gt;Telegram is a messaging chat app that offers video group chats also. It’s well set up for that: the app already has a feature that lets you create groups with up to 200,000 members, and you can have either private or public groups. For now, video chats are limited to 30 people (although up to 1,000 can watch); still, this was a welcome add-on for Telegram users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FMWRLA"&gt;Signal is a communications app known for its emphasis on secure messaging via end-to-end encryption. Until recently, it only allowed a maximum of five participants in its video calls; however, it &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360052977792-Group-Calling-Voice-or-Video-with-Screen-Sharing#group_call_requirements"&gt;now allows up to 40 people&lt;/a&gt; to take part via &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/how-to-build-encrypted-group-calls/"&gt;its own open source Signal Calling Service&lt;/a&gt;. Signal is mainly meant for mobile devices; to use it on a desktop, you have to link it to an existing mobile app. Still, if you already use Signal messaging, you now have the option to use it as a meeting app as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of these don’t have a free version, or the number of participants who can use the free version is limited. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluejeans.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlueJeans&lt;/a&gt; starts at $9.99 per month for unlimited-time meetings with up to 100 participants, while the free version of &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/meeting/"&gt;Zoho Meeting&lt;/a&gt; only permits a maximum of two participants (and up to 10 webinar attendees), and &lt;a href="https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing"&gt;Intermedia AnyMeeting&lt;/a&gt; allows four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nhBhm"&gt;Other apps offer some video meeting ability as an added feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is mainly set up for text chat, but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0ADE9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 4th, 2021, 2:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 11th, 2020. Since then, all entries have been updated; in addition, two apps have been dropped (Hangouts and Spike) and Glip Pro has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fBE0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 2021, 9:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect the fact that Whereby’s breakout groups feature is out of beta and to add Signal to the list of alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd3p07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 2021, 4PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Spike back to the main list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngMfAf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 2021, 2:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Telegram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JpuW0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 19th, 2021, 3:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to change Meet’s time limit and to reflect the change of Glip Pro to RingCentral Video Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ADwy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2021, 8:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The introduction and some entries were updated, Signal was added to the main list, and Houseparty was removed from the alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin adds touchscreen and flashlight to its best multisport watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nLdnRacV40A7O9k-e-_m0EBlfRs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402549/47433_FENIX.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garmin’s new Fenix 7 series &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Garmin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71XQB9"&gt;Despite being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845465/garmin-fenix-7-smartwatch-leak"&gt;leaked to hell and back&lt;/a&gt;, the Garmin Fenix 7 series was a no-show at CES 2022. That’s because Garmin decided to wait until today to separately announce its revamped multisport GPS smartwatches. On top of an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2F735520&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22883556%2Fgarmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated flagship Fenix 7 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, Garmin is also launching the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2F760778&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22883556%2Fgarmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epix&lt;/a&gt; — a rugged outdoors smartwatch with an always-on color display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4TG33"&gt;Some things with the new Fenix 7 smartwatches will be familiar to Garmin fans. There are still three sizes: the 42mm Fenix 7S, the 47mm Fenix 7, and the whopping 51mm Fenix 7X. The Fenix 7S and 7 will come in “regular” versions made of fiber-reinforced polymer, but there are also Solar Editions and Sapphire Solar Editions for all three models. Additionally, the Sapphire Solar Editions upgrade the materials to titanium and a sapphire display for extra durability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3W2VNt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGQqO9yukME?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lU202x"&gt;As the names suggest, Garmin is also adding solar charging capabilities to all three sizes. Garmin says that compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;Fenix 6X Pro&lt;/a&gt;, these watches have 54 percent more solar surface area — and that purportedly translates to longer battery life. With GPS enabled, Garmin says the max battery for the 7S is 90 hours and 162 hours with solar charging. The numbers jump up for the 7 from 136 hours to 289 hours with solar. For the 7X, Garmin says you’ll get 213 hours or 578 hours with solar. Of course, these are all estimates, and what you actually get will heavily depend on your individual usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mkr57Q"&gt;The Fenix 7 watches will all support every major satellite system but also add the L5 frequency range for better accuracy in “challenging GPS environments.” L5 is one of three “modernized” GPS signals for civilian use that, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/"&gt;the US government&lt;/a&gt;, have “higher power, greater bandwidth, and advanced signal design.” The lineup also gets touchscreen capabilities — but don’t worry, Garmin isn’t getting rid of button controls. (In fact, it’s actually adding button guards to the start and stop button to minimize accidental presses.) The idea is to offer multiple ways of navigating through menus, such as scrolling through your settings or zooming in on GPS maps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVCfXIRb-fusJPGdngyzDKt8fsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168926/fenix7X_Solar_HR_1007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also opt for a red light, and a “strobe mode” that matches a runner’s cadence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TkZq7l"&gt;The 7X also has a shiny new hands-free LED flashlight feature with adjustable red or white light to help multisport athletes see, and be seen, during nighttime activities. Garmin says it’s activated via a double-tap and works for both left-handed and right-handed users. It has an optional strobe mode, where the flashlight matches a runner’s cadence, too. Basically, it’ll flash red when your arm swings down and white when it swings up. Garmin says it functions like head and tail lights on cars so that others have a better sense of which direction a person is headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvmPYs"&gt;For software, Garmin’s adding a Real-Time Stamina tool to help you compare the potential stamina you’d have at moderate intensity versus your stamina at your current effort level. The company’s also adding a new mapping feature called Up Ahead, which tells users the location of aid stations, elevation climbs, water, and other points of interest on a particular course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c514f4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYDXEh07VzQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ0dpY"&gt;Meanwhile, Garmin’s finally refreshing its Epix smartwatch, seven years after it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7486787/garmin-fenix-3-epix-vivoactive-smartwatch-connect-iq-ces-2015"&gt;first introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new Epix is basically what you’d get if you took the Fenix 7 and asked, “What if I swapped out the transflective screen for a 1.3-inch always-on OLED display?” It comes in three 47mm models and includes many of the same features as the Fenix 7 like buttons, touchscreens, and Real-Time Stamina. The main difference between the two lineups is the Epix doesn’t have the new LED flashlight or support solar charging. As for battery life, Garmin claims the Epix can last up to 16 days on a single charge — and an impressive six days with the always-on display enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxldcJRFVV-q5J6D9LRGlLBF09c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168929/47433_EPIX_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Epix lineup adds a 1.3-inch, always-on color touchscreen display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0KpwxB"&gt;Both smartwatch lineups also support push notifications, Garmin Pay, music storage, and safety features. They also come with the usual Garmin health features, like heart rate monitoring, respiration, stress tracking, body battery, fitness age, and sleep tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adr0LX"&gt;The Fenix 7 series cost a pretty penny, but that’s par for the course for Garmin’s flagship GPS smartwatches. While it depends on which materials and models you opt for, the Garmin Fenix 7S and 7 start at $699.99 and go up to $899.99. Meanwhile, the 7X models range from $899.99 to $999.99. The Epix is similarly priced, as Garmin considers it a premium multisport GPS watch. It costs $899.99 for the slate and steel model and $999.99 for the white and black titanium models. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s next update adds adorable monsters and brings back Tilted Towers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jqTd0Renz5Tasec8ePg2M9pjSs=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402447/19BR_Klombos.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2wGScA"&gt;The next big update for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; brings back something old and adds something new. As fans have long expected, the snow on the battle royale island has slowly melted, revealing the return of Tilted Towers, an iconic urban area that dates back to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s first island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIupE2"&gt;Elsewhere in the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v19-10-update-battle-atop-tilted-towers-and-klombos"&gt;v19.10 update&lt;/a&gt; is the addition of a new kind of creature: a giant, adorable monster called a Klombo. It looks like something ripped out of &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, and developer Epic says that they’re mostly gentle and they appear to add a new way of getting around the map. “Ascend their tails to get to the blowhole on their heads, then get launched a great distance upwards to escape a tricky situation,” Epic wrote in a blog post. There’s also a new item, a colorful kind of berry, that can be used to feed them and lure them around the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OON6d0"&gt;Between these monsters and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22817392/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-spider-man-new-island"&gt;other chapter 3 additions&lt;/a&gt; like sliding, swinging around like Spider-Man, and unpredictable weather including destructive tornadoes and lightning storms, this might be the most hectic &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdNML1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10982502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZwv1H"&gt;Aside from the gameplay additions, Epic also announced a new collaboration with street artist Kaws — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1451971688250454016"&gt;who previously designed a character for the game&lt;/a&gt; — and London-based gallery Serpentine. The two are launching a virtual version of Kaws’ “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYzCoI6pmNi/"&gt;New Fiction&lt;/a&gt;” exhibition, which will also be featured at the IRL gallery. The virtual recreation was built by BeyondCreative and Alliance Studios inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Creative, and will be available to check out from January 18th at 10 AM ET until January 25th. (Players can access it using the island code 9441-7852-6686.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNSXcc"&gt;This isn’t the first time the art world has come to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Creative. In 2020 the Manchester International Festival debuted “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"&gt;Your Progress Will Be Saved&lt;/a&gt;,” which featured interactive exhibits from artists like LaTurbo Avedon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US airlines warn of ‘catastrophic disruption’ on Wednesday due to 5G activation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="United Airlines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yR3wkaDo8JQ3vHDqDtxpTFYjHvU=/1x0:5268x3511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402433/1237621702.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;United Airlines was among those to issue a warning.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Daniel Karmann/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0Fg5n"&gt;CEOs from major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines have warned that the impending deployment of new 5G spectrum on Wednesday could cause “catastrophic disruption” for flights across the country starting tomorrow. The warning, which was also signed by shipping companies including UPS Airlines and FedEx Express, was issued in a letter from the CEOs &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that both commercial and cargo flights could be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAWxrF"&gt;The letter was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, and White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emfBTu"&gt;The 5G spectrum in question is known as C-band, and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s deployments are due to go live on Wednesday, January 19th after suffering multiple previous delays. At the core of the issue are fears that these new C-band airwaves could interfere with sensitive radar altimeters on certain aircraft, my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;explained earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. Altimeters are critical for landings especially when visibility is limited, and failures in this system were linked to a fatal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ej6Pz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kxZjie"&gt;“Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded” as a result of the new 5G deployments, the airlines wrote in their letter. “Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies,” that could cause “chaos” and strand “tens of thousands of Americans overseas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyc9K"&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment that pilots rely on to take off and land in inclement weather,” United Airlines said in its own statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Without more safeguards, the rollout of this 5G spectrum could “result in significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities” and cause “hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, [and] also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CjG21s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq9xgz"&gt;Although there’s technically 220MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the plane’s equipment and the new 5G spectrum, airlines are worried that the older equipment found in some planes might still be affected. Air safety concerns have already delayed the rollout of C-band from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;to this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glSd7F"&gt;United is calling for 5G to be implemented “everywhere in the country on Jan. 19, except within approximately 2 miles of airport runways at affected airports.” It indicates the size of this buffer could be reduced after further analysis by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). On January 3rd, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T previously agreed to take steps to mitigate the potential effect on aviation, including placing buffer zones around 50 airports for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msu3ya"&gt;C-band spectrum has already been rolled out in &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com"&gt;nearly 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; without causing altimeter failures according to one tech trade group, and United says the right government policies could allow for a safe deployment in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ1rql"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have a lot riding on this new spectrum, which they paid $65 billion for in an auction last year. Both need the extra spectrum to handle the traffic demands of 5G, especially given AT&amp;amp;T’s plans to shut down its 3G network next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSAvPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Pen is a durable stylus made for Chromebooks in the classroom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Pen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_FW146VRm80nfHVu6Gev67FvJg=/0x0:5180x3453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402369/logitech_pen_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Logitech Pen doesn’t requiring pairing, thanks to its USI support. But, it won’t work on every Chromebook released.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKVHJ3"&gt;Logitech has announced a new stylus called Pen, and it’s aimed at being the best option available for classrooms full of Chromebooks. Unlike many rubber-tipped styli, the Pen is an active stylus that supports the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standard, effectively guaranteeing one thing: it’ll work out of the box on a number of recent Chromebooks — no pairing required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRZOAN"&gt;If a Chromebook is mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/usi-enabled-devices"&gt;on this list&lt;/a&gt;, the Pen will work with it. Logitech says that more Chromebook manufacturers have been moving forward with the USI standard, so expect to see more models added to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuKZbq"&gt;The Pen can recharge via a USB-C port located where you’d find the eraser on a traditional pencil, and Logitech says it can last for up to 15 days of regular school use, though that claim assumes your student is using it for about 2.5 hours a day with its smart sleep and wake feature enabled. If it dies, Logitech claims that a 30-second charge can yield 30 minutes of use, and it can be used while recharging.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it’s just for education, and IT managers in your districts will be able to inquire through Logitech’s site and other education tech resellers about orders starting today, with shipping kicking off in April 2022. Logitech shared that each Pen costs $64.99, but it isn’t allowing piecemeal purchases yet. You’ll have to place a larger order.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C port on the back of the Pen makes it easy to charge it with the same charger that comes with most Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yeqvOr"&gt;It’s true that Logitech isn’t the first company to release a USI-compatible stylus, nor is its Pen the most affordable or the most capable. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Faccessories-and-software%2Fstylus-pens-and-supplies%2Fstylus-pens-%26-supplies_pens%2F4x80z49662&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22879874%2Flogitech-pen-usi-made-for-chromebook-stylus-education" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s $34.99 USI Pen that’s available for purchase here&lt;/a&gt;, just to name one example of many, offers the same 4,096 levels of pressure and support for the USI standard. But Logitech’s angle for the Pen is to be more of a staple for the classroom with its design. Its yellow splashes of color are meant to be reminiscent of a pencil, and there’s even a Pen loop that can be adhered to the lid of a Chromebook display for easy storage. The Pen features a silicon grip to make holding it feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGTKS4"&gt;We had a chance to test the Pen on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, a higher-end Chromebook that’s compatible with the USI standard. The Pen worked very similarly to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JCCW94F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penoval USI stylus&lt;/a&gt; in terms of lag and writing dynamics and its larger, triangle-shaped design might be easier for younger hands to grip. It lacks any buttons or even an eraser tip on the top, which is compatible with some, but not all, USI Chromebooks. It’s clear Logitech prioritized simplicity over an abundance of features here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHx6I1HSNENIkO7eTJyb_EVG3Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23174978/logitech_logi_pen_USI_stylus_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pen’s triangular shape and rubberized texture are designed to make it easier for small hands to hold it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aWX25"&gt;Logitech says the Pen meets the MIL-STD-810G spec for durability and is able to survive up to four-foot drops. It’s also spill-resistant. Additionally, Logitech built its Pen tip in such a way that students who fidget shouldn’t easily be able to pull it out (though it can be removed with needle-nosed pliers). Logitech is backing each stylus with a three-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGkEor"&gt;Given that several other USI-supporting styli are widely available to consumers, it’d be great if Logitech made this one available to more than just educators. The company didn’t even hint at an eventual widening of its availability. Though, perhaps that might change once it launches in April 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces first smartphone chip with AMD ray tracing GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdgzfFADNMneGsNwEeisOZ1I6K4=/50x0:1400x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401999/exynos.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlSgCH"&gt;Samsung has announced the Exynos 2200, its new in-house mobile processor for smartphones. It’s the first mobile system-on-a-chip to include a GPU with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, enabling features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfvFJq"&gt;The collaboration with AMD has been long in the making. The two companies first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18651894/amd-radeon-samsung-graphics-soc-chipset-exynos-smartphones"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a licensing deal in 2019, then AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462678/samsung-amd-exynos-ray-tracing-mobile-soc"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; last year that Samsung’s “next flagship mobile SoC” would use RDNA 2. Samsung recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860530/samsung-exynos-2200-amd-rdna-2-graphics-gpu-january-11th-teaser-chip"&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; an announcement event for the Exynos 2200 that was supposed to take place on January 11th, but it was mysteriously delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMfCZL"&gt;The Exynos 2200 is manufactured on Samsung’s 4nm EUV process. Samsung is branding this GPU as “Xclipse,” and AMD’s SVP of Radeon GPU tech David Wang says in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “the first result of multiple planned generations of AMD RDNA graphics in Exynos SoCs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uTOS3w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22880297/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-review-screen-battery-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lyx7H9"&gt;On the CPU side, the Exynoss 2200 uses Armv9 cores: one high-powered Cortex-X2 “flagship core,” three Cortex-A710 cores for balanced performance, and four more efficient Cortex-A510 cores. There’s also an upgraded NPU that Samsung says offers twice the performance of its predecessor, and the ISP architecture is designed to support camera sensors of up to 200 megapixels, one of which Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653558/samsung-isocell-hp1-gn5-200-megapixel-camera-sensor-announced"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THNPMt"&gt;Samsung’s highest end Exynos chips usually make their way into the company’s flagship Galaxy S phone series, although models sold in the US and certain other markets use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SoCs. Other phone makers like Vivo occasionally use Exynos chips in their own devices, but we’ll likely have to wait until the presumptive Galaxy S22 is in our hands to find out if AMD’s technology translates into a meaningful leap forward in mobile GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
