    <title>Are you ready to eat your delicious nutrient square? Yum, yum, yum</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVi4tAygjyEh6nUZdAMYWFsFebw=/0x74:1596x1138/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69777917/image.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s normal food, blitzed into a pulp, and compressed into 50 gram squares&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: SquarEat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jlw5Ts"&gt;Slap bang in the middle of a Venn diagram with two circles labelled “sincere tech startups” and “dystopian satires that are a little on the nose” you will find &lt;a href="https://squareat.com/"&gt;SquarEat&lt;/a&gt;: a company that you would swear is a joke if you weren’t already familiar with how the simulation we’re all living in likes to collide fact and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJEsxs"&gt;SquarEat was apparently born of a simple idea: what if you could eat squares? But boy oh boy does it deliver on that premise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfRR7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SquarEat says it’s “created a new concept of food” (squares)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lchbPQ"&gt;The company claims to have “created a new concept of food” (squares) which it makes by blitzing ingredients and compressing them into “ready-to-eat” 50 gram packages (squares). You can buy your squares in packs of four or six and have them delivered to your house. They can be eaten hot or cold, heated in a microwave or a frying pan, and come in a &lt;a href="https://squareat.com/squares"&gt;dazzling array of flavors&lt;/a&gt; including chicken, beef, asparagus, peanut, seabass, and salmon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeQOZA"&gt;The Miami-based startup seems to have launched in June, and, honestly, I’m still not totally sure it’s not satire. When images of its products started doing the rounds on Twitter this week most people were similarly confused, with its square meals drawing comparisons to dystopian TV shows and films like &lt;em&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1N7dij"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uAHJeS"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/food/what-squareat-modular-squared-food-company-taking-over-twitter-t229104"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, SquarEat’s chief marketing officer Laura Vacaflores assures the publication that square food is both real and tragically misunderstood. Vacaflores said the square shape of the foods helps standardize preparation and packaging, and that a single square isn’t supposed to be a full meal replacement. The squares are intended to be eaten as multiple units (my favorite way to measure meal intake) and can be combined with other non-square nutrient forms, aka regular food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NoJ13J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not the first food concept that adopted the square shape, if you, for example, think about tofu”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0XlCj"&gt;“Thanks to the square shape, we are able to run mass production using gourmet techniques […] Allowing us to produce a superior-quality food and sell it at an affordable price,” Vacaflores told &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;. “We are not the first food concept that adopted the square shape, if you, for example, think about tofu. The only thing we are asking people to leave behind is their original idea about the external appearance of the food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocexfz"&gt;Vacaflores added that each square is seasoned ready to go and uses proper ingredients. “There’s no substitute at all [...] For example, the chicken is just chicken breast, black pepper, lemon and rosemary,” she told &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;. “It has nothing weird, no additives. I know a lot of people think this is a meal replacement, but it’s not, it’s just chicken. People try it and say, ‘Wow, it tastes just like chicken,’ and yes, because it is chicken. There’s nothing else.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ipe82F-7tEZ5zRudmBPpJ-dox2E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806564/Screen_Shot_2021_08_26_at_1.09.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SquarEat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The squares come in a variety of flavors, both sweet and savory, each 50 grams in size. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZsekdyijRFqFjz0yT4L5OOF3MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806553/Screen_Shot_2021_08_26_at_1.00.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SquarEat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The square shape is supposed to help standardize packaging and production&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wam1xy"&gt;While SquarEat doesn’t seem to be an elaborate joke, it’s also very much a startup that, I would wager, is not yet manufacturing its squares at anything near industrial scale. The company is currently &lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/squareat"&gt;raising money on WeFunder&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s pitching an extremely ambitious plan to “disrupt the food delivery market” by replacing meal plan programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1cjwF"&gt;Honestly, I’m not sure what to think about SquarEat. It strikes me as an unnecessary and dispiriting way to eat food, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be a success. Meal replacement shake companies like Soylent and Huel are still with us after all, and leaning into the dystopian imagery inherent in their product didn’t seem to hurt them in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Krzdbw"&gt;More than that, I now have a genuine urge to find out what these squares taste like. Their little Lego forms are now embedded firmly in my imagination, and I must know what it feels like to bite into a square chicken. Maybe for lunch today I’ll make a square meal of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who’ll make the next million-dollar NFT?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A stylized illustration of artists all copying the same pixelated Mona Lisa." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYoieVHwOeIyqzGW-6tWLiRJUyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69777709/VRG_ILLO_4687_NFT_Copycats.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Generative profile picture NFTs are all the rage, but creators say it’s not just about the money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LcznG3"&gt;The first time Tom Williamson and Rob Mehew tried to make an NFT project, they landed on unicorns. Overweight unicorns, actually. Plump and slumped over, unable to stand up on their own four hooves, and illustrated in a chunky 16-bit art style. They called the project &lt;a href="https://www.faticorns.com/"&gt;Faticorns&lt;/a&gt;, generated 10,000 of the creatures, and put them all on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXEI68"&gt;Only one sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHSQJ6"&gt;So they scrapped the project, and teamed up with Evan Luza and artist Colin Egan on something different: &lt;a href="https://www.coolcatsnft.com/"&gt;Cool Cats&lt;/a&gt;, a generative NFT project that planned to make 9,999 cartoon cats. They were cute, blue, illustrated, and decked out in accessories like beanies, bandanas, and flannels. This time when they went on sale, all 9,999 sold out in eight hours, netting them around $400,000 in Ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZigPdF"&gt;What was different about the cats? They were “cute and cool,” said Luza, who goes by ELU online. And the experience of buying the cats felt like an event. “The way we packaged the offering, it felt like opening a pack of Pokémon cards,” Luza said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A collage of Cool Cats NFTs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah3XhR_d9hwz9evZQZZW59T_Qos=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802474/unnamed.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cool Cats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collage of Cool Cats NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JVnYEt"&gt;Projects like Cool Cats have become all the rage in the NFT space in the past few months, driven by the success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs"&gt;ludicrously valuable collections like CryptoPunks&lt;/a&gt;, some of which have sold for millions of dollars each. These projects typically follow the model CryptoPunks set back in 2017: they include 10,000 pieces, all of which are “programmatically generated” — randomized, basically, from a set of premade components like smirks, hats, mustaches, and T-shirts — and formatted as headshots, perfect for a profile picture on Twitter or Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GcxNMW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dozens of generative NFT projects have started in recent months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvp4hr"&gt;You can think of these NFT series a bit like big games of Pokémon, except each creature can only be captured once. That means if you want more of them, or never caught one in the first place, you have to buy one from someone who started playing early. Naturally, fan favorites like Pikachu and Charizard are going to be valued more than some seventh-generation throwaway like Cutiefly. That’s why in an NFT series like Cool Cats, you’ll see some cats going for 3ETH (around $10,000), others going for 15ETH (around $49,000), and all of them &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; above the initial “capture” price of .02ETH (about $42 at the time), for people who got in on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U482oM"&gt;Dozens of these projects have popped up in recent months, typically themed around a single creature. There are penguins, aliens, and robots; lions, tigers, and bears; plus a whole lot of cats — Gutter Cats, MoonCats, Mad Cats, Punk Cats, Stoner Cats, and BlazedCats (yes, there are &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;weed-themed cat NFT series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2w2vI1"&gt;The biggest, at the moment, is apes. &lt;a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in April, includes 10,000 apes with a punk vibe, dressed in trucker hats, stud earrings, and mischievous grins. At launch, apes were sold for the equivalent of $186 a pop. Now, the cheapest ape costs more than $80,000, and several have sold for more than $300,000 each at today’s exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Six apes wearing different clothes and accessories. One has pizza in its mouth, another wears a flannel, another has 3D glasses." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-KPTklU8ysNSmsqoNGMk-b3NIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802500/bayc.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bored Ape Yacht Club&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BAYC website includes a gallery of all 10,000 apes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUQ9wT"&gt;“We were thinking, we have this club, this dive bar, what kind of people do we imagine would go into this bar? Who do we want? What kind of club would we ourselves want to be a part of?” one of the Bored Ape co-founders, who goes by the pseudonym Gargamel, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “After a long night of brainstorming, it came to [Gordon, another co-founder] in a dream: Bored Ape Yacht Club.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqVNHY"&gt;It’s easy to get the impression that these projects, all modeled after and inspired by the immense success of CryptoPunks, are cash grabs for project owners and NFT holders alike, snatching up cookie-cutter JPGs with the hope of reselling them a couple of months or years later for a surprise windfall. Pop into the Discord servers for any of these projects, and you’re likely to see a conversation about “floor prices” — the cheapest an NFT from the series is selling for — before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="utODkQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re trying to build this long-term”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbTVeA"&gt;But nearly everyone who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about their involvement in launching or buying these NFT series said the monetary component was just one part of the story, and often not even their primary interest. “When I had an ape as my profile picture, I could DM any other ape and connect with them,” Spencer Gordon-Sand, a current Cool Cats owner (and former ape owner) who works in venture capital, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a really easy in to a community of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MfFr0"&gt;The projects’ real selling point is supposed to be some combination of great art and access to a great community. Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC for short, was really the first to figure this out. The BAYC founders tried to make the process of getting an ape as easy as possible for initial buyers, and they styled their series as offering membership to a literal “club.” Their website is built around illustrations of a divey bar, and it grants access to a members-only board where you can leave digital graffiti, so long as you own an ape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pR2Ji"&gt;Several project founders said that focusing on money first and leaving community behind was a recipe for disaster. “That’s a loser’s game,” Gargamel says. “That’s how you create an unsustainable pump” — a temporary price surge that eventually crashes — “and we’re trying to build this long-term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Eight dogs wearing different accessories. One has a monocle, others have sunglasses, one has a bowtie." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQ80rWmI55Z6Xu5Hipyt-lKnszI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802525/dogepound.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Doge Pound&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of The Doge Pound’s 10,000 NFT dogs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yRpysb"&gt;So far, building a community has mostly meant launching a Discord, doing free giveaways, and announcing plans for new features. BAYC plans to launch “mutant apes,” while Cool Cats is working on models to bring its cats into the metaverse. The giveaways mean that NFT owners get &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; NFTs, giving them more to sell, and driving up the floor price as outsiders see the added value that comes with owning a cat, ape, or whatever else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkSUDj"&gt;BAYC, in particular, is interested in expanding what it means to be a member of their club. “Your ape is your Amex black card,” Gargamel said. It gets you NFT cred online, but maybe it can also get you into exclusive presales and events, like a recent meetup in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Vh7Zf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important that you do the best you can to get a good return on everyone’s money”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGEFO0"&gt;The potentially lucrative financial return is very much still an incentive for buyers and founders, though, and other projects are clearer about that. &lt;a href="https://www.bonesandbananas.com/"&gt;Bones &amp;amp; Bananas&lt;/a&gt;, a series of NFT bananas, is meant to bolster the price of Bored Ape NFTs. The project, run by Bored Ape fans (and ape owners), uses some of the money raised from its own 10,000-edition series to buy up apes at floor prices, increasing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hpjyL"&gt;And one leader of &lt;a href="https://thedogepoundnft.com/"&gt;The Doge Pound&lt;/a&gt; was straightforward about viewing buyers as people trusting him with their money. “I view everyone as an investor ... and I think it’s important that you do the best you can to get a good return on everyone’s money,” says the co-founder, who goes by the pseudonym John Lemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dJsQG"&gt;Plus, successful projects essentially become booming small businesses for their founders overnight. After their initial sale, project leaders may have hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital (Lemon said he netted $1.2 million). They’ll typically then get a small cut — usually around 2.5 percent — every time one of their NFTs is resold. So the next time a rare ape goes for 100ETH, the project leaders would collect 2.5ETH from the sale, or more than $8,000 at today’s exchange rate. That’s a huge incentive to continue maintaining a community and stoking further interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5iRJW"&gt;“It’s pretty insane,” Gordon says. “That was actually the joke: we’re now running a multimillion-dollar hedge fund with like 13,000 really active users in a Discord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMiOzW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After NFTs comes merch, events, and games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h3gn4n"&gt;Their end goal isn’t necessarily just the cash they make by skimming a little off the top, though. The Bored Ape creators say they envision turning BAYC into more of a streetwear brand — they’ve already offered limited-release hats, T-shirts, and hoodies, which have subsequently been flipped for outlandish prices on eBay — and that NFTs might just be their first product. And the Cool Cats team envisions their brand turning into the next Hello Kitty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOsBUG"&gt;For Luza, the Cool Cats co-founder, the dream looks something like this: “You walk into Target and you see Cool Cats plushies on the shelves, and buy a Cool Cats game on the Switch that comes with a Cool Cats NFT, and when you’re at the register at the front you cop a Cool Cats Snickers bar on the way out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WycoTk"&gt;So far, the generative NFT model has worked. Many of these projects have built both community and monetary value in the months since they launched. But no one has figured out what comes next. It took years before CryptoPunks skyrocketed in value. And while the free goodies and second-generation characters can give these projects a boost for now, creating new generations of their NFTs risks diluting the exclusivity that comes with joining these oddball clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztHYSr"&gt;“Too many new NFT projects using what is becoming a tired playbook,” Kevin Rose, a venture capital investor, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/1425827716595474447"&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the morning he switched his avatar to a Cool Cat. “I’m going to avoid buying new projects that have 10,000 unique [insert animal], where they swap out 3D glasses, hats, hair, necklaces, and skins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VzwtQy"&gt;But as long as the cat — or robot, or alien, or ape — is cute enough, people might still be willing to spend a fortune to get one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celebrate Jeff Bezos’ big day out to space with a $69 miniature dick rocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESisugweWfoGPiahQPtFt55iUu8=/0x34:1400x967/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69777646/blue_origin_new_shepherd_rocket_model.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gz6Phz"&gt;Capitalism is all about fairly distributing wealth based on hard work and personal merit, which is why Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-is-jeff-bezos-mind-blowing-facts-net-worth-2019-4"&gt;earns in 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt; what the median US worker makes in a year. He’s just that much better than you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsVuxj"&gt;Thankfully, Jeff’s also a &lt;em&gt;super sweet&lt;/em&gt; guy who’s totally grounded and knows how to use his  wealth to help people. For example, he spent billions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585470/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-amazon-customers"&gt;taking a tourist trip into space&lt;/a&gt; on a dick-shaped rocket which I personally found to be very chill. Sure, some people say the trip was a huge vanity project; a colossal pissing-contest between egotistical, morally blind billionaires whose pocket change could save countless human lives with just as much intrinsic value as their own, but to that I say: &lt;em&gt;stop being such a bummer, dude!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blue Origin New Shephard rocket model: yours for $69.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ANJtKi"&gt;If, like me, you want to celebrate Mr Bezos’ Big Day Out to Space, then I have just the thing for you: a &lt;a href="https://estesrockets.com/blue-origin-new-shepard/"&gt;1/66th scale model of the New Shephard rocket&lt;/a&gt; with a pricetag of $69.99. Yes, that’s right: it’s a miniature dick-rocket that costs $69, which means the noise you can hear right now is the invisible hand of the market making jerk-off motions behind your back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhQBMb"&gt;And okay, so while I’m obviously not personally jazzed by the vast wealth inequalities that Jeff Bezos embodies, I definitely am still a nerd who thinks rockets and space are very cool. And for that reason it’s my duty to point out that Estes Rockets makes &lt;a href="https://estesrockets.com/product-category/rockets/"&gt;all kind of models&lt;/a&gt; that you can equip with little ballistic packs and fire into the air, which seems like a very fun way to spend an afternoon. I mean, the rockets even have little parachutes built into the nose-cones that deploy mid-air to float them down safely for god’s sake! That’s brilliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deMX9n"&gt;The Blue Origin rocket (which we &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/jeff-bezos-dick-rocket-goes-on-sale-for-69-in-scale-mo-1847560824"&gt;spotted via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) costs $69.99 by itself, but you can also pay $109.99 for a &lt;a href="https://estesrockets.com/product/new-shepard-starter-set/"&gt;full starter set&lt;/a&gt; including launch pad, controller, and a pack of single-use engines. The rocket’s coming out November 1st but you can preorder now. It’s almost certainly the nearest you’ll get to going to space like Jeff. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Panos Panay now directly advises CEO Satya Nadella </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8FXR8fCQIHhdV1Qo790UE1ea0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776820/akrales_191002_3704_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uiYtp"&gt;It was just last February that Microsoft Surface chief Panos Panay was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124805/microsoft-panos-panay-windows-hardware-devices-joe-belfiore-office-team-reorg"&gt;promoted to lead the company’s entire Windows software and device teams&lt;/a&gt;, and now he’s moving up in the world again — he’s becoming an Executive Vice President who’ll be part of the Senior Leadership Team that advises Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella himself, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/microsoft-promotes-product-chief-panay-to-senior-leadership-team?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFw8Xh"&gt;We’ve interviewed him &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426955/microsoft-surface-duo-folding-android-phone-history"&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931870/microsoft-surface-panos-panay-andromeda-pocketable-surface-interview"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550134/microsoft-windows-11-panos-panay-interview"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; over the years, and not just because he’s one of the company’s faces — as Microsoft’s Chief Product Officer, he’s had a direct hand in creating and introducing many of Microsoft’s Surface devices including the recent Surface Duo. Also, yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2015/10/6/9465373/microsoft-surface-panos-panay-pumped"&gt;he’s the one who’s perpetually pumped&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpsie7"&gt;From a corporate standpoint, this means Windows will have a seat at the senior leadership table for the first time since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176220/microsoft-windows-reorg-business-terry-myerson-ai-cloud"&gt;former Windows chief Terry Myerson departed in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which makes sense: then, Nadella believed in a shift away from Windows to the cloud, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22549385/microsoft-satya-nadella-interview-windows-11-decoder"&gt;he recently changed his mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LyPov4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the business of Windows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22549385/microsoft-satya-nadella-interview-windows-11-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bjEffv"&gt;It’s not clear what the move means for Rajesh Jha, who served as Microsoft’s EVP of Experiences and Devices last we checked, or others on Microsoft’s leadership page, for that matter. That page appears to have been recently replaced with &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/leadership/"&gt;a smaller list of “Executive Officers”&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210629044942/https://news.microsoft.com/leadership/"&gt;the previous list of “Senior Leaders&lt;/a&gt;,” but a number of Microsoft’s other EVPs like Xbox boss Phil Spencer and Cloud + AI boss Scott Guthrie haven’t returned to the list yet, and there’s no evidence their roles have changed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyl5Ri"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella himself recently became more powerful than ever: in June, he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;unanimously elected to become chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt; in addition to CEO, the first person to have both roles at Microsoft since Bill Gates himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51f8zU"&gt;Panay also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371995/microsoft-surface-panos-panay-joining-sonos-board-of-directors"&gt;joined Sonos’ board of directors&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go’s pandemic-era distance changes are here to stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-Cj3dxrlVD37fC4YPmk8sfBrEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776652/jbareham_160711_1134_0051_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nOwMXZ"&gt;Niantic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274?s=20"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s going back on at least one of its controversial gameplay changes to Pokémon Go. The company is permanently increasing the distance you can be from the real-world locations of Pokéstops and Gyms and still interact with them. The new base limit is 80 meters (262 feet), the distance Niantic introduced at the start of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goMjmW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274?s=20"&gt;At the start of August&lt;/a&gt;, Niantic reverted the in-game interaction distance back to 40 meters (131 feet) in the US and New Zealand, much to the disappointment of fans who had appreciated the added accessibility benefits and COVID-19 safety the change offered. Now Niantic is promising to keep the increased distance permanently, along with other changes it’s announcing on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCmgoK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trainers - we’re looking forward to sharing our plans as a result of the task force on September 1, but one thing does not have to wait! From now on, 80 meters will be the base interaction radius for PokéStops and Gyms globally. (1/2)&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1430644448929718274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WWLJ1P"&gt;You can see all the details &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=top-articles&amp;amp;f=covid-19-event-feature-updates&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;on Niantic’s changelog&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s worth calling out the other changes that are sticking around for now in the US. Incense — used to attract wild Pokemon — will be less effective unless you’re moving, just like it was before the start of the pandemic. The changes to gift frequency from Buddy Pokémon are also locked in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6LZtM"&gt;This move from Niantic is a positive sign that the company is willing to adapt to the needs of its players. That may be in part due to &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/pgo-exploration-bonus-response/?hl=en"&gt;the internal “task force”&lt;/a&gt; Niantic formed &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-creators-form-rules-task-force-after-players-1847434506"&gt;to address player issues and the threat of a boycott&lt;/a&gt;. Niantic plans to “share the findings of this task force by the next in game season change” on September 1st. Until then, sticking to a longer interaction distance is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google finally releases YouTube Music Wear OS app, but only for Samsung’s new watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KH0R9GpthaPAYFaSlyhFoFKVrtg=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776599/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZdESe"&gt;Google has finally released a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music"&gt;Wear OS app for YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;, which could seem like welcome news for people who have been waiting for a way to play their music off Google’s streaming service after the company shut down Google Play Music on Wear OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355887/google-play-music-wear-os-smartwatch-shut-down-youtube-music"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. But the new app comes with a few caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJf8JX"&gt;The biggest catch is that the new app only works on one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s two new watches&lt;/a&gt; powered by Wear OS 3, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9231765#zippy=%2Csmartwatches"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;. Those watches won’t be available until August 27th, so even if you want to try the new app right now, you won’t be able to unless you have a Galaxy Watch 4 or a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v72Yi2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if you have a compatible watch, it sounds like the app has some frustrating limitations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqvlUQ"&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; lucky enough to have one of the new watches, the YouTube Music Wear OS will let YouTube Premium subscribers download music right to their watch, meaning you can listen to tunes with just a watch and a pair of Bluetooth headphones, even when you don’t have an internet connection. However, based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/youtube-music-for-wear-os-hands-on/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s &lt;/em&gt;hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the app, it sounds like there might be some frustrating caveats you’ll have to keep in mind when you’re actually using the Wear OS YouTube Music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6BmNg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says there doesn’t appear to be a way to &lt;em&gt;stream&lt;/em&gt; music from the app — it appears that you can only download music right now. And annoyingly, you can only download songs while the watch is on a charger, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyPEyq"&gt;Still, it’s nice that a YouTube Music Wear OS app is available at all, even in its currently limited form. Google hasn’t shared details about when the app might be available on other Wear OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Halo-themed Xbox Series X will be available for preorder Wednesday night at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NL8cM3ielzKurMIO--NeMnnJbgI=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776517/Xbox_Series_X_Halo_Infinity_Limited_Edition_Console.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XpHAgv"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Series X — one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22640993/gamescom-opening-night-live-2021-trailers-halo-call-of-duty-marvel-xbox"&gt;many announcements&lt;/a&gt; to come out of Gamescom Opening Night Live — is set to arrive on November 15th, nearly a month before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;confirmed launch of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on December 8th. Preorders for the $549.99, limited-edition bundle went &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x-halo-infinite-limited-edition-bundle/8rpm8t9ck0p6&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22405673%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;live at the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/BX2bPx"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, with initial preorder stock selling out in a matter of minutes. Thankfully, if you weren’t able to snag the &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;-ready console earlier, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F288604110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is giving you another chance Wednesday, August 25th, at 8:30PM ET / 5:30PM PT, according to a Walmart spokesperson who &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-preorder-the-xbox-series-x-halo-infinite-limited-edition-console/#listicle-fc5f04f8-4d87-4184-a3d1-eb1291d8ed3f"&gt;confirmed the details with &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="M43Fzl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft announces $549 Halo-themed Xbox Series X console","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="teZbgm"&gt;Like with all next-gen console restocks, we suggest signing in to Walmart and updating your address and payment information before the preorders go live. You might also have better luck securing a console through Walmart’s mobile app, if you’re struggling to do so using your browser. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750124999975188068#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy already has a landing page&lt;/a&gt; for the bundle as well, but we haven’t received any indication as to when the preorders would go live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4utwUP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10718933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OToBaH"&gt;As for the console, the limited-edition model is designed to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, with gold accents, metallic plating, and a starry exterior that takes a cue from the franchise’s celestial setting. The console also comes with a downloadable copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;(upon its release), a matching controller, and blue accents on the top vent instead of green. It even powers on and off with custom, &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LtpE5l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You won’t be able to play Halo Infinite co-op or edit multiplayer maps at launch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634448/halo-infinite-co-op-campaign-forge-delay-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ct3PRn"&gt;In addition to the limited-edition bundle, Microsoft announced a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller with a design that differs slightly from its bundled counterpart. The &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Limited Edition Elite Series 2, as it is known, dons a green, Master Chief-inspired exterior, as well as a custom case and a gold D-pad. It launches on November 15th for $199.99, though initial preorders have already sold out at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-halo-infinite-limited-edition/90z8k1dbj8zd&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22405673%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dvoxmedia.stories.usechorus.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ioJH8Z"&gt;A manual uploaded to the FCC gives us a look at Facebook’s experimental Project Aria AR glasses, which apparently go by the codename Gemini (&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/project-aria-gemini-ar-glasses"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;announced Project Aria in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with a message big on vision and light on details — though it was clear that the device exists to help Facebook in its quest (no pun intended) to create a computer that sees and understands the world. Seeing the &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AWS6-5646/Users-Manual/Users-Manual-5086339"&gt;actual headset’s manual&lt;/a&gt; gives us a bit of an idea about how it does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdETyC"&gt;In some ways, the Gemini headset is like a real pair of glasses, though in other ways it’s very much not: it can be fitted with corrective lenses if need be, but you can’t fold the arms down or use it in a VR headset. And, of course, it’s loaded with things that normal glasses don’t have, like a proximity sensor, Qualcomm chip, and, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;, the same camera sensors found in the Oculus Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_qXY-viM5YofHJnhxuoq6J0LNM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805786/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.50.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There aren’t a ton of buttons on the glasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oHg1mu"&gt;The glasses are charged using a Fitbit-esque magnetic connector, which can also transfer data. There’s a companion app for uploading data that the glasses collect and checking on the connection status and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5n8XIJiadgRli7yNqz08w-dGyE8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805790/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.50.34_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the “Ariane” app used to manage Gemini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VoOumi"&gt;While the manual gives us an interesting look into a project that Facebook hasn’t shared a ton about, it’s not an up-to-date one. It seems the version found on the FCC’s site is version 0.9 of the document, which is dated August 28th, 2020 — it’s likely that Facebook has made some changes in the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nbVzd"&gt;Facebook says &lt;a href="https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/"&gt;on its Project Aria site&lt;/a&gt; that the glasses aren’t a commercial product. They’re not acting as a prototype for something that the general public will eventually buy. That’s reiterated by the manual’s many statements that the headset is an engineering product and is only for use by people working for Facebook. The company has said that the headset is worn by researchers on its campuses and in public — though it says that any data collected is anonymized, and the headset has a “privacy mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uAVWdizoaQXHrxzNuXFdcjncrh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805827/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_3.06.36_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gemini captures four different angles of videos, which can be viewed on a computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SNsm9d"&gt;While Aria may not be headed to store shelves, Facebook does have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599599/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-next-product-launch-specs"&gt;entirely different set of “smart glasses”&lt;/a&gt; that it plans on releasing in collaboration with Ray-Ban. Like the Aria, Facebook says that they won’t actually augment your reality with a screen, so at this point, it’s unclear what will make them smart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Microsoft promise billions to help bolster US cybersecurity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Meets With Advisors And Experts On Improving Nation’s Cybersecurity" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sO9sjnrqFaJW0Sl418EjTZ2C1kU=/0x0:7308x4872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776275/1234864172.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YrRvnX"&gt;Tech companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft promised to help bolster US cybersecurity after a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday. The pledges vary by company but range from spending billions on cyber infrastructure to offering supply-chain aid and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnIorJ"&gt;Wednesday’s high-profile meeting with tech CEOs comes on the heels of major cyberattacks against US government agencies and energy infrastructure like the Colonial Pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="00rsvw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The federal government can’t meet this challenge alone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2QaFQE"&gt;“The reality is, most of our critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, and the federal government can’t meet this challenge alone,” Biden said at Wednesday’s meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwflTO"&gt;Apple announced that it would work with its suppliers to “drive mass adoption of multi-factor authentication” as well as providing new security trainings, incident response, and vulnerability remediation. Amazon plans to offer a multi-factor authentication device to all Amazon Web Services account holders for free and to make all of the company’s employee security awareness training available to the public at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="froyyv"&gt;Google said it would spend more than $10 billion over the next five years to strengthen US cybersecurity and the software supply chain. Google also promised to train more than 100,000 Americans in data analytics and IT support through the company’s Career Certificate program. Microsoft said that it would invest $20 billion in five years, making similar promises as Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdlqB9"&gt;Wednesday’s meeting was attended by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Apple CEO TIm Cook, IBM Chair and CEO Arvind Krishna, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, along with representatives from other industries like energy and education.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s improved search could help close the gap with TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxOJDx0NR2fnOWkuxHE9Ev8jsqA=/50x0:1175x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69776262/visualsearchInstagram.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QIKBE4"&gt;Instagram plans to more prominently feature photos and videos in search results in the future, Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/break-down-how-instagram-search-works/"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The change could show the grid of photos and videos a keyword search can pull up alongside results for accounts and hashtags, not dissimilar to how TikTok displays results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1IgsN"&gt;The search tweak is part of “a series of improvements designed for inspiration and discovery,” according to Mosseri. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570475/instagram-keyword-search-update-hashtag-account"&gt;has used keyword search&lt;/a&gt; as a way to offer visual results — certain terms can pull up pages of suggested images — but Instagram’s new plan will give those more prominence. Mosseri writes that searching with a term like “space” will pull up suggested photo and video results along with traditional accounts and hashtags, encouraging more exploration. The visual results will still live behind a tap of a keyword, but they should be more prominent and common. (Mosseri demos the tweaked search experience &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1430625664583880704?s=20"&gt;at around 3:30 in this video&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMFVygBPHKAqYIpPuHPoFvFbHKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805632/Image.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s layout for search results, featuring visual results first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2OhGO"&gt;Instagram’s current keyword search is pretty hit or miss, however; it doesn’t always pull up results universally or with relevant collections of photos. That’s why Mosseri says the company is also expanding the number of terms that will pull up results, starting with English and then building out from there. When asked, Instagram wasn’t able to provide a specific launch date for the search improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4MBtseMinCUjSvxGar-BPR2ASx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805377/currentsearchInstagram.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram’s current account and hastag-focused search results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSzpbg"&gt;Even without more visuals or new keywords in the mix yet, Instagram’s main criterion for what results it shows is relevance, according to Mosseri. The company has a series of “signals” it considers when showing results, listed below in order of importance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BtcK26"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your text in Search&lt;/strong&gt;. The text you enter in the search bar is by far the most important signal for Search. We try to match what you type with relevant usernames, bios, captions, hashtags and places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9roRw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your activity&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes accounts you follow, posts you’ve viewed, and how you’ve interacted with accounts in the past. We usually show accounts and hashtags you follow or visit higher than those you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4Cbxu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about the search results&lt;/strong&gt;. When there are a lot of potential results, we also look at popularity signals. These include the number of clicks, likes, shares and follows for a particular account, hashtag or place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kIcZpB"&gt;Those same suggestions apply to how your content shows up as well. The platform looks at the text in your Instagram handle and bio, your location, and the captions on individual posts to determine if your content is relevant for a given search. The company also attempts to filter out content that violates its &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendations Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, including sensitive topics like violence or semi-nudity. You don’t have to go back far to see how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585623/instagram-sensitive-content-control-setting-explore-tab-limit-offensive-posts"&gt;Instagram’s handling of these issues&lt;/a&gt; has provoked concern in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8dpD4q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram making changes to its algorithm after it was accused of censoring pro-Palestinian content ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22460946/instagram-making-changes-algorithm-censoring-pro-palestinian-content"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gAzyq7"&gt;Both of the improvements to search should make Instagram more usable and maybe more enticing to keep clicking through. The surface-level similarities to TikTok might not be a mistake either: Mosseri has openly discussed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus"&gt;post-photo-sharing era&lt;/a&gt; Instagram is entering with an embrace of video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547045/instagram-suggested-posts-test-algorithm"&gt;and more suggested content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
