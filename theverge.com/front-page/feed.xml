    <title>Amazon is using a custom logging device to track the trucks moving its freight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZzGjwwumMl0EIxmLA3WJ_9adJM=/150x0:4050x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755052/1155745555.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FjSI4T"&gt;Amazon has developed electronic tracking technology for the trucks used by its partners to monitor their movement and hopefully improve driver safety, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-amazon-tracking-device-to-monitor-trucker-safety-collect-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Electronic logging devices (ELDs) are federally required to prevent fatigue-related accidents on trucks, but now it seems Amazon will offer its partners a custom ELD offering, possibly giving Amazon direct access to a lot more data from a tool it maintains itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlYtjo"&gt;Amazon’s Relay ELD — named after the company’s &lt;a href="https://relay.amazon.com/"&gt;Relay platform&lt;/a&gt; for booking delivery jobs — works by plugging hardware into the diagnostics port of trucks to directly digest information from the engine, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;writes. It then communicates that data over Bluetooth to be logged in an accompanying app. ELDs typically track location, movement, and when a truck turns on or off, to monitor drivers' hours. When asked, Amazon didn’t explicitly confirm that it had created its own ELD hardware. “As with many solutions, we use a third party for hardware manufacturing,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4xQrL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ELDs are required, whether they’re made by Amazon or not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="StUgu4"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s ELD product is being offered to members of the Amazon Freight Partners Program (who often also lease trucks from the company) with the plan to have them installed in hundreds of tractor trucks by the end of the year. Amazon was able to confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had begun piloting new ELDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LS7AZB"&gt;“We are actively investing in safety mechanisms across our operations and recently started piloting new electronic logging devices, which are required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, with a select number of carriers to capture driver compliance with Hours of Service regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gb9fkp"&gt;Amazon says that currently the new ELDs are being piloted on six tractor trucks, to monitor &lt;a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service"&gt;hours of service (HOS)&lt;/a&gt; compliance — basically the maximum amount of time a driver is on duty, including breaks. The company didn’t share if the data is used for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjZJ9Z"&gt;The location and movement data Amazon sees could help make sure drivers are taking rest breaks on long-distance trips, or potentially help the company make other logistics-related decisions. Previous plans that put cameras in the cabs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-amazons-trucking-ambitions"&gt;semi-trucks&lt;/a&gt; have also raised questions about what kinds of Amazon monitoring go too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fPq72"&gt;Still, an ELD seems far less invasive than a camera — and again, the ELDs would be there anyway — but it’s still a valuable piece of a larger information puzzle, for keeping drivers safe, and Amazon packages on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ed4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VFuDW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSiXkk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the Android 12 public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Z1jFBKwTqk84s2rFuJUaCgwyjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754827/vpavic_210517_4586_0020.0_2.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HfA92K"&gt;Android 12’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22206092"&gt;public beta is now available&lt;/a&gt;, following Google’s deep dive into the new software at Google I/O 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;My colleague Dieter Bohn got an exclusive in-depth look&lt;/a&gt; at the new Material You design language, as well as everything else that’s new. And good news: if you’ve got an eligible device, you can try it out right now, and that’s what I’m going to walk you through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt42YD"&gt;What’s great is that you don’t have to go through the tricky, fail-prone task of flashing your phone. Instead, you can easily enroll it to receive the update with a few clicks from your desktop or mobile browser, and in just a few minutes, you’ll be ready to install it on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcSZRh"&gt;When you set up the Android 12 beta on your device, you’ll be set to receive all future beta updates to the OS (including the final release) over the air, which is convenient. As always, keep in mind that this beta is unfinished software, so you could encounter bugs ranging in severity. At the very least, make sure that your device data is backed up on the cloud, and maybe think twice about loading the beta onto your daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2tPxD"&gt;First, let’s see if you have an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PSE32G"&gt;Which phones currently work with Android 12 beta?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="shYkqe"&gt;Pixel 3, 3 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0y9mMh"&gt;Pixel 3A, 3A XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCnwI5"&gt;Pixel 4, 4 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uz1NKb"&gt;Pixel 4A, 4A 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f7OJNO"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="60pdaS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FContent%2FAndroid-12-Beta%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22442576%2Fandroid-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z5CUDP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fcn%2Fos%2Fdeveloper-preview%2Fandroid12&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22442576%2Fandroid-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9, 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wofbdn"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developers.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc/index#id=91"&gt;Oppo Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (model CPH2173)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4WKaBi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/global/en/android-12-beta.html"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rf6h0u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.vivo.com/doc/detail?id=103"&gt;Vivo iQOO 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKmMME"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fservice%2Fsupport%2Fandroidsbeta.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22442576%2Fandroid-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11, Mi 11 Ultra, Mi 11I, Mi 11X Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m4HRC0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/developer/android-12/"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8q22Yu"&gt;as well as models from &lt;a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android12_betaprogram/"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spot.tecno.com/global/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=98054&amp;amp;id=98054"&gt;Tecno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realmebbs.com/post-details/1393156430865309696"&gt;Realme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;How you get this software on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the Android 12 beta on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “view your eligible devices”. You might be nudged via notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. Google says it may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, follow the instructions on each page, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Nvidia controlling Arm could create real problems,’ UK regulator concludes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0V-y4GgPsoBKmJh90KrCo2uQTyM=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754619/NVIDIA_Endeavor_building_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="390JrG"&gt;Remember when Nvidia’s CEO warned yesterday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;buying Arm might take “longer than initially thought&lt;/a&gt;,” but that it was no big deal and “not one particular delay”? It sure &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like a big deal as of today: on Friday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended a Phase 2 investigation, because it’s worried that Nvidia would be incentivized to stifle innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwUmEZ"&gt;“We’re concerned that NVIDIA controlling Arm could create real problems for NVIDIA’s rivals by limiting their access to key technologies, and ultimately stifling innovation across a number of important and growing markets. This could end up with consumers missing out on new products, or prices going up,” writes CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-finds-competition-concerns-with-nvidia-s-purchase-of-arm"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rml1FK"&gt;While the CMA’s full report isn’t available yet, it does offer &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summary-of-the-cmas-report-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-digital-culture-media-sport-on-the-anticipated-acquisition-by-nvidia-corporation-of-arm/nvidia-arm-summary-of-the-cmas-report-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-digital-culture-media-sport-on-the-anticipated-acquisition-by-nvidia-corpo#public-interest"&gt;an executive summary&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of the reasons for concern: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ryycJy"&gt;1.7 The CMA found significant competition concerns as a result of the effect of such foreclosure in the supply of CPUs, interconnect products, GPUs, and SoCs across several global markets, spanning the datacentre, internet-of-things, automotive and gaming console applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y94K7T"&gt;1.8. The CMA found that the foreclosure strategies identified would reinforce each other and would, individually and cumulatively, lead to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition (&lt;strong&gt;SLC&lt;/strong&gt;), and consequently to a stifling of innovation, and more expensive or lower quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DtbV"&gt;“The CMA believes that the Merger may create incentives to change Arm’s business model to favour NVIDIA,” one passage reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKKrDN"&gt;While the CMA notes that Nvidia offered to “ensure an open licensing regime, based on equal access and interoperability,” the regulator suggested that it doesn’t believe that would be enough. Even if Nvidia agreed to sell off some of Arm’s intellectual property, that wouldn’t be enough without a deeper investigation, the CMA says, given how complex the licensing arrangements can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXwEit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;National security was also a potential concern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBeTpG"&gt;The British government announced in April that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;also worried about national security implications&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the CMA to investigate those as well, but the executive summary doesn’t offer any conclusions there. If there had been any, they might have pushed the CMA to move to a phase two investigation — but it sounds like that’s what’s happening regardless. The investigation now gets referred back to the UK’s Secretary of State to decide “whether the merger should be referred for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation on both competition and national security grounds, or if it should be passed back to the CMA to investigate on competition grounds only.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rBnhz"&gt;As my colleague James Vincent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;wrote yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; the UK isn’t the only regulator interested in this deal, and Nvidia currently has until 2022 to clear the purchase with those regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZJ1q9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONyrRs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to take advantage of Android 12’s new privacy options  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bi2nWiys1f38Ptr8LN5ZzUQ_N30=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754580/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eoCcjO"&gt;Privacy is probably one of the biggest buzzwords in tech these days, and even the data-loving Google is getting in on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZo9mH"&gt;The Android 12 update boasts a handful of privacy-related additions you’d be wise to explore. (The software is currently at the tail end of its beta phase and expected to launch any week now.) Some of them are under the hood and automatic — such as the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436367/google-io-android-private-computer-core-machine-learning-data-privacy"&gt;Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt; that’ll allow certain types of sensitive computing to happen in an isolated environment, entirely on your device. But others are more on the surface. And that means it’s up to you to take advantage of them — or at least understand what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1WUkx"&gt;Here are the three most significant privacy-related additions in Android 12 and what you need to know in order to take advantage of them. (Note that for now, Android 12 is only available on Pixel phones; once it is available on other devices, directions may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mPCfiA"&gt;Privacy Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk2htd"&gt;First and foremost in the Android 12 privacy lineup is Google’s shiny new Privacy Dashboard. It’s essentially a streamlined command center that lets you see how different apps are accessing data on your device so you can clamp down on that access as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3PPkP"&gt;In Google’s version of Android, you can get to the Privacy Dashboard in three easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bKuCAA"&gt;Open up your system settings (by swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the gear-shaped icon on the panel that appears).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEvrUI"&gt;Scroll down and tap the Privacy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qcO2iF"&gt;Tap the “Privacy Dashboard” entry at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Privacy Dashboard in Android 12. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7a0xXt-xmDfDEqvzhDayI8UKpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795021/android_12_privacy_dashboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Privacy Dashboard in Android 12. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A timeline of data access is never more than a tap away. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zU31T4ntdzXxohO_UcQwXaSA4I8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795023/android_12_privacy_dashboard_list.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A timeline of data access is never more than a tap away. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBwdG6"&gt;From the Privacy Dashboard, you can drill down into any specific type of feature (such as “Location” or “Camera”) and you’ll get a timeline that tells you exactly which apps have been accessing that feature when. (If you’re looking for a feature other than location, camera, or microphone, you may need to tap on “See other permissions” at the bottom of the screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqyR4O"&gt;After that, if anything seems amiss to you, all it takes is one more tap to get into any app’s permission list and pull back on what it’s able to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gBsXBW"&gt;Sensor access indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ck7ZMV"&gt;Next on the Android 12 privacy list is a feature you’ll occasionally see on your screen but whose message might not always be obvious. Whenever an app is accessing your phone’s camera or microphone — even if only in the background — Android 12 will place an indicator in the upper-right corner of your screen to alert you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk98r3"&gt;When the indicator first appears, it shows an icon that corresponds with the exact manner of access. But that icon remains visible only for a second or so, after which point the indicator changes to a tiny green dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p809BU"&gt;So how can you know what’s being accessed and which app is responsible? The secret is in the swipe down: Anytime you see a green dot in the corner of your screen, swipe down once from the top of the display. The dot will expand back to that full icon, and you can then tap it to see exactly what’s involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12’s access indicators start out as icons, but then change to tiny green dots." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DtKvRdBgQimBBKq4pM-uLcMi1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795138/android_12_access_indicator.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s access indicators start out as icons, but then change to tiny green dots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A swipe and a tap will reveal any current and recent past sensor access." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlDGNVhME3OdnW3nEHIgl7M_ENg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795463/android_12_access_indicator_details_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A swipe and a tap will reveal any current and recent past sensor access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bZLdw"&gt;Tapping on any app’s name in that pop-up will take you directly to that app’s permission page, where you can reassess what types of access it does and does not allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKYzoY"&gt;Fast-toggle sensor switches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oeBXvp"&gt;Last but not least is a new series of toggles that let you turn your phone’s camera, microphone, or GPS sensor completely off with a single fast tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkUsP7"&gt;The toggles live within Android’s Quick Settings panel, and they might be hidden by default. To uncover them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZigVyP"&gt;Swipe down twice from the top of your phone’s screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DkNKlg"&gt;Tap the pencil-shaped icon in the lower-left corner of the Quick Settings panel. If you’re using a phone other than a Pixel, you might have to tap a three-line menu icon and then look for an “Edit” command there instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CDnMMN"&gt;Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list and look for the tiles labeled “Camera access,” “Mic access,” and “Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NzCsIf"&gt;One by one, press and hold each tile for a second, then slide your finger up to move it into the active area of your Quick Settings panel. The higher up you go, the higher it’ll appear in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new camera, microphone, and location access toggles can easily be moved..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WgJykj6-jNa80pXo956nz9pnuog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795464/android_12_sensor_toggles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera, microphone, and location access toggles can easily be moved...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...into the active and visible area of the Android Quick Settings panel." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ece5XVNTl9bZCWf0c0cbPfMSmEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795465/android_12_sensor_toggles_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...into the active and visible area of the Android Quick Settings panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7zaxo"&gt;Once you’ve got all three in place, just tap the arrow in the upper-left corner of the screen. The fast-toggle switches will now be present and accessible in your regular Quick Settings area. And all it’ll take is a swift swipe down and a tap on the right tile to disable any associated sensor at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnxCat"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7vcqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You won’t be able to play Halo Infinite co-op or edit multiplayer maps at launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JafLuy1R8vSvwdh5ONVfwJc6h8k=/142x0:1234x728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754565/bbe15939_a7a9_41cb_9010_a9f8e0a30adf.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSbdhT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is set to release this holiday season, but at launch, you won’t be able to play the campaign mode cooperatively with your friends or edit multiplayer levels in Forge mode, developer 343 Industries announced Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCU6yT"&gt;“When we looked at these two experiences — campaign co-op and Forge — we made the determination [that] they’re just not ready,” Joseph Staten, head of creative on &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Yct2QKgF5e4?t=1086"&gt;said in a video&lt;/a&gt;. “So we’re going to keep campaign co-op and Forge in the oven for a little bit longer. When they’re ready, we’re going to release them as part of our seasonal roadmap next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWBNff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Campaign co-op is targeted for season two while Forge is set for season three&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QHB76X"&gt;343 Industries is targeting shipping campaign co-op in season two and Forge in season three, Staten said. The goal is to ship a new season every three months, which means campaign co-op will likely be available about three months after launch while Forge arrives six months after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4b9iD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign co-op and Forge mode are two of the series’ hallmarks, so fans may be disappointed to hear that they won’t be available at launch. But 343 is still committed to launching the campaign and season one of multiplayer this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b71LA9"&gt;“We’ll be talking about our actual release date very soon,” said Staten. Xbox is hosting an event in just a few days &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/09/join-us-for-the-gamescom-2021-xbox-stream-and-more/"&gt;on August 24th&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps Microsoft and 343 Industries will reveal the date there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q8qkYH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Halo Infinite has had a bit of a rocky history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fR9bOS"&gt;The delays to campaign co-op and Forge are the latest for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, which has had a bit of a rocky history. The game was originally set to release alongside the Xbox Series X and S in 2020, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;it was delayed to 2021&lt;/a&gt; following a campaign showing that birthed &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;the infamous Craig meme&lt;/a&gt;. Staten, who was involved with the first three &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403687/halo-infinite-bungie-joe-staten-returns-campaign"&gt;was brought onboard&lt;/a&gt; shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q5ikh"&gt;Despite the game’s bumpy development, though, impressions of the game’s recent multiplayer technical preview were &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-beta-multiplayer-technical-preview"&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-infinite-multiplayer-hands-on-technical-preview-beta/"&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt;, which could indicate that the game will live up to fans’ expectations when it’s finally released this holiday season. Whenever it does come out, though, you’ll have to wait a little while longer to play the campaign with friends or modify things in Forge mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjUeAk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS6Nfr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VidCon cancels its 2021 event, says next one will be in June 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6JV_wAbFSq8fkG7iUQIfRMIGLN0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754362/mgid_arc_content_vidcon.com_e633f61d_681a_4968_957e_7cbca730d86d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: VidCon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6evpLK"&gt;VidCon &lt;a href="https://www.vidcon.com/info/fz5mw5/covid-19-statement"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that its US convention, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/vidcon-2021-dates-featured-creators-announced-for-return-to-anaheim-convention-center-1234934765/"&gt;scheduled in late October&lt;/a&gt;, has been canceled due to concerns over the increasing number of COVID cases. The organizers, however, say that VidCon 2022 is scheduled for June 22nd-25th and that non single-day tickets for the 2021 event will automatically transfer to the new event. VidCon has noted, though, that the event next year won’t necessarily have the same guests and activities planned for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHB7lh"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21191134/video-2020-canceled-youtube-influencers-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;VidCon 2020 was canceled&lt;/a&gt; with hopes of holding the event in the fall, which then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525328/vidcon-digital-summer-2021-panels-sessions-rebrand-creators"&gt;turned into hopes of holding the event in summer 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Those hopes finally became the scheduled event that’s now canceled. However, the company does have &lt;a href="https://www.vidcon.com/now"&gt;digital events that it’s been holding&lt;/a&gt; as part of what it calls VidCon Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HNnfhW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With a heavy heart, we must confirm we are canceling VidCon US 2021   We hope to see you in Anaheim June 22 – 25, 2022! For more information on ticket transfers, refunds, and FAQs, please visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/VwfnzSH0mR"&gt;https://t.co/VwfnzSH0mR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3lHz0A9uMU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3lHz0A9uMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— VidCon (@VidCon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VidCon/status/1428738607129538566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh1wk"&gt;VidCon’s announcement post says that anyone who wants a refund will have until June 3rd, 2022, to get one and that single-day tickets will be automatically refunded. It also points users to &lt;a href="http://help.vidcon.com/support/solutions/folders/19000169510"&gt;an FAQ about the cancellation&lt;/a&gt; if they have more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xPO8V2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VidCon isn’t alone in its hesitancy to hold large-scale events in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTjoAj"&gt;VidCon isn’t alone in its hesitancy to hold large-scale events in 2021. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455077/blizzcon-canceled-global-event-blizzconline-blizzard"&gt;other in-person events&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356451/pax-east-canceled-online-west-unplugged-penny-arcade-reedpop"&gt;scheduled for this year&lt;/a&gt; get canceled, and tech keynotes from the likes of Apple and Samsung have remained virtual. Some events are still planned for later in the year, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1428386279578750976?s=20"&gt;PAX West&lt;/a&gt; and our own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606531/on-the-verge-event-tickets-date-time-nyc-10-year-anniversary-party"&gt;On the Verge&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will require attendees to be fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA2KVs"&gt;Planners have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370176/covid-19-vaccinated-people-cdc-guidance-herd-immunity"&gt;struggled to find a balance&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to organizing events during the pandemic, having to figure out whether to hold hybrid events, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;cancel things entirely&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609757/new-york-auto-show-2021-canceled-delta-variant-covid"&gt;move things to a future date&lt;/a&gt; where conditions will, hopefully, be better. In early 2021, it appeared as if that time would come sometime this year, but various concerns have kept that from being the case. There’s uncertainty about the delta variant, unvaccinated people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22622344/breakthrough-covid-delta-uncertainty-vaccines"&gt;breakthrough cases&lt;/a&gt; for people who have gotten the shot, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611045/moderna-third-shot-covid-19-vaccine-booster-delta-variants-coronavirus"&gt;how many shots people should receive&lt;/a&gt; (not to mention the concerns about the &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/16/covid-vaccine-tracker-update-map-world-countries-coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-johnson-johnson-vaccinations-june/"&gt;vaccine’s availability outside of the US&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop a hate raid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5etykSdhcvMCO6XEjJmbMWHqtE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754143/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SXcJQ2"&gt;Hate raids happen with little warning. A streamer will get a follow notification and instead of feeling joy that a new person has joined their community, dread sets in as their chat suddenly erupts into an uncontrollable geyser of hateful messages. Hate raids have infested Twitch over the last few weeks, primarily targeting marginalized streamers making life on the platform so miserable many are considering abandoning it altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqmm1W"&gt;Twitch has promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;new safety features are in the works&lt;/a&gt;, but streamers are upset and angry that more hasn’t been done to stop hate raids. Streamers are using the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitchdobetter&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#twitchdobetter&lt;/a&gt; hashtag to agitate for change, and they are creating and sharing resources to protect themselves against the seemingly endless tide of trolls bombarding streamers with racist, transphobic, and ableist messages. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with the streamers and Twitch community members taking the safety of marginalized creators into their own hands about the tools they’ve created to do battle against the trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AKtq5U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Twitch Ambassadors aren’t safe, who can be?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcCIoj"&gt;Raids are a normal part of Twitch culture and happen when a user on Twitch sends their viewers to another streamer, usually as a show of support. Every Twitch streamer is competing for more eyeballs on their channel, and raids are a way to spread the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hU3Cj1"&gt;Hate raids are when people use the raid mechanism to abuse a streamer. Instead of another user’s organic audience, a streamer’s chat is flooded with hateful messages from bot accounts. Hate raids are difficult to deal with since a streamer or their mods have to ban hundreds of fake, bot-generated accounts at a time, slowing down the normal, everyday process of chat management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Qo1Yb"&gt;To combat this, streamers are creating what they’re calling a “panic button” — a string of chat commands that are executed all at once at the press of a single button. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/queerlybee"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitch streamer who has experience with this “panic button” setup, to explain what it does and how streamers can use it to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMsYKU"&gt;“It’s a multifunction button on my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579144/elgato-stream-deck-mk-2-stand-faceplates-usb-c-valve"&gt;Elgato Stream Deck&lt;/a&gt; that disabled the alert box, disables on-stream chat, clears chat, switches to sub-only mode, creates a stream marker, slows chat down, and plays ads,” Bee says. “I also then have a reverse button to undo those actions for when things have calmed down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seg8lI"&gt;For users who don’t have fancy equipment, Twitch streamer &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/EarthToBre"&gt;EarthtoBre&lt;/a&gt; created a program that does the same thing using &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/lioranboard-stream-deck-animator.862/"&gt;Lioranboard&lt;/a&gt; — a free stream management tool that works similar to the Stream Deck. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@earthtobre/video/6989351750478138630"&gt;She even made a tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LFEMkZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@earthtobre/video/6989351750478138630" data-video-id="6989351750478138630" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@earthtobre" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@earthtobre"&gt;@earthtobre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @pixeldaddie Trolls Be Gone button, but make it FREE!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - EarthToBre" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6989351668534020869"&gt;♬ original sound - EarthToBre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmUL9y"&gt;Streamer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JustMeEmilyP"&gt;JustMeEmilyP&lt;/a&gt; took the response to combating hate raids a step further by creating a &lt;a href="https://hateraidresponse.carrd.co/"&gt;Hate Raid Response&lt;/a&gt; website full of useful tools like how to program a “panic button” and tips on what to do before, during, and after a hate raid occurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX3L8F"&gt;The Hate Raid Response website was created in January, long before this most recent hate raid boom. JustMeEmilyP told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she actually created the website in anticipation of Black History Month, when Twitch promotes black streamers and consequently makes them targets for racist trolls. She saw anxiety from Black streamers ahead of Black History Month and acted accordingly. At first, the Discord she set up was relatively quiet and the resources were lightly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Amvam"&gt;“That’s where we kind of sat all year until &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RekItRaven"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/11/twitch-do-better-hate-raids/"&gt;started #TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt;. Folks came rushing in,” JustMeEmilyP says. “The hashtag has been a blessing because even the most veteran [streamers] among us have learned this past week!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tndKr2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CommanderRoot"&gt;CommanderRoot&lt;/a&gt; created a tool that lets users &lt;a href="https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/follower_remover.php#"&gt;block or ignore followers en masse&lt;/a&gt;. Combine this program with &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hackbolt"&gt;Hackbolt&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l_9rcxS6VSVka2WqvcjRbEDSPacEdKa/edit#gid=1331099117"&gt;Bots n Bigots&lt;/a&gt; spreadsheet that is a constantly updated catalogue of bots known to be involved in hate raids, and streamers can fight back. But increasingly, streamers are wondering why they have to fight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FOyiRJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Hate raids makes marginalized content creators nervous.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kmBsFj"&gt;Hate raids aren’t a new phenomenon, but their recent explosion across the platform is causing anxiety and anger in the Black, trans, queer, and disabled creators they target because it seems that Twitch, knowing of this endemic problem, hasn’t done enough to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yZ6nS"&gt;“If [Twitch] Ambassadors aren’t safe, who can be,” asks Tanya C. DePass, founder of the non-profit I Need Diverse Games and the creative director of the RPG &lt;em&gt;Into The Motherlands&lt;/em&gt;. “[Twitch] can’t keep minority streamers safe. Why should we keep creating content on a platform that isn’t going to at least update and show as if they are working on something as a measure until a more permanent solution can be implemented?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDIUPn"&gt;A lot of the resources being used to combat hate raids are shared on Twitter and in Discords with the attitude of, “If Twitch won’t do it, we will.” When Twitch announced a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428476525570056202"&gt;Public Access Channel&lt;/a&gt; show on Twitter in the midst of the #twitchdobetter movement, the replies were filled with people complaining about what they saw as Twitch ignoring the problem to instead promote their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ei7wM"&gt;But a spokesperson for Twitch confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that tools are in the works that will hopefully address this problem. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1425550620887375876"&gt;Twitch’s statement&lt;/a&gt; after the #twitchdobetter hashtag started gaining popularity alludes to solutions like improved account verification and ban evasion detectors. Twitch also has &lt;a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Managing-Harassment?language=en_US"&gt;a page dedicated to offering tools&lt;/a&gt; to help streamers fight harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDrVSV"&gt;And after we published this article, Twitch said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428813772391522307"&gt;in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; that hate spam attacks “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428813849885495298"&gt;do not have a simple fix&lt;/a&gt;,” but reiterated that it is committed to fighting hate raids and other harmful behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jCzeoQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've been building channel-level ban evasion detection and account improvements to combat this malicious behavior for months. However, as we work on solutions, bad actors work in parallel to find ways around them—which is why we can't always share details.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428814017779306499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4R4zYR"&gt;But the promise of help to come doesn’t do much to combat what streamers are facing right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvAdGc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Content Warning: Racial slurs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7nRohq"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Only took 7 hours but we did it yall!&lt;br&gt;Completed the Hard R speedrun at 100%&lt;br&gt;Thank you Twitch for making this all possible!&lt;br&gt;Couldn't do it without you!!!!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitchDoBetter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oMo6y3PcZV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oMo6y3PcZV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— hymn (@visecs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/visecs/status/1428164099167473666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, streamed today. Chill BG3, no cam, just mic. And you guessed it! Attempted hate raid, AGAIN. CW: Nazi imagery in the screenshots below. So &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; what y'all doin' about this? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who else wants to ask if it's racially motivated. Who? &lt;a href="https://t.co/4ty5IejJ7v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4ty5IejJ7v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cypher | Watch Game Changer on #BETHerTV (@cypheroftyr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cypheroftyr/status/1427665867752579084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5VMNr"&gt;Images like the above are becoming all too common, and aside from the obvious distress such attacks can cause, there are other, more insidious ways hate raids are affecting streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGSJzd"&gt;“It makes marginalized content creators nervous,” says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYMG_saffista"&gt;Dr. Saffista&lt;/a&gt;, a games academic who streams as community outreach and research. “And in that trepidation they are either not streaming, putting things into place that ultimately limit community building and growth, or become so nervous every time their alerts go off that they are ‘off their game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1fp0a"&gt;Indeed, some of the solutions to hate raids are not tools streamers typically use. According to Twitch culture, such limitations (like turning on subscriber-only mode — a mode that limits who can speak in chat to those who have subscribed to the channel — or limiting chat to emotes only) inhibit a channel’s ability to grow. So this epidemic of hate raids has a one-two punch effect of harassing an already vulnerable group of people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; making it that much harder for marginalized streamers to have the same kinds of success cis het white men (a demographic curiously unaffected by the recent rash of hate raids) have had on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq4r1l"&gt;For the casual viewer interested in helping, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/amazon-twitch-do-better-stop-hate-raids-against-people-of-color-and-marginalized-creators"&gt;change.org petition&lt;/a&gt; and concerned Twitch users can always continue to support marginalized creators and uplift their voices when these things happen and in general. The tools outlined here will help streamers prepare for the possibility of a hate raid. Hopefully, they won’t need them for too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="J5m9NK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWFA5k"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JHLP0"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gY4Mp"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice right now. You won’t find a big, show-stopping screen here, or bells and whistles like a fast refresh rate screen. Instead, you get a phone that covers the basics really well, plus IP67 waterproofing and timely software updates — all at a lower price than last year’s model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bkDOPH"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZnehD"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, and you definitely won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOgwn4"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5TvHua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tETMb0"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAfzxG"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB1ZXR"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="smYbEU"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best budget Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VAnoi0"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery too, a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMgcHa"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor, and that’s fine. The 4A 5G was already a well-equipped midrange device and the 5A makes some strategic updates to its foundation. The dual standard / ultrawide rear-facing camera, Snapdragon 765G processor, and 6GB RAM / 128GB storage combination served the 4A 5G well and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdocxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQBwQn"&gt;Another thing we can count on Pixel phones to do well is software, and the 5A is no exception. It ships with Google’s own Android 11 OS and is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS platform upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan, but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQGX8e"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but that’s a highly range-limited network that’s still pretty hard to find. That’s fine, but there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using later this year called C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release — it’s only available in the US and Japan, and isn’t being sold through any of the major US wireless carriers. Taking all of that into consideration, the Pixel 5A is still the inexpensive Android phone that we’d recommend to most people. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best budget Android phone with a fast refresh-rate screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GW6KVJ"&gt;On the Android side, the Galaxy A52 5G is a great option, albeit at the very top of the price range considered in this guide. It includes some features that aren’t too common in a budget phone, like its fast-refresh rate screen, an IP67 water resistance rating, and for now at least, monthly security updates for fast access to bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s379P4"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIaTf"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating is handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSNCy0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if you want to make an investment in a phone that you can keep using years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHMHO"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright-spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 4A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFmNNo"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;The best “get it while you can” affordable Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc3Oon"&gt;If you want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt; Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, lacks 5G support, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349 but you’ll have to act fast if you want one — with the Pixel 5A and Pixel 6 debuting this fall, Google won’t be selling the 4A for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huw9Ph"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera. It’s based on generation-old technology at this point, but it’s still the best in this class and it can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g65TGg"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrF1h5"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it, putting you first in line for Android updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggNCE"&gt;Unfortunately, in a little over a year’s time, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be slowing down. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VV1d"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for well under $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal — while you can still find it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 covers the essentials with a couple of nice touches, like a 90Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;A great midrange option if you’re outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hMRHe3"&gt;The OnePlus Nord 2 isn’t sold in the US, and that’s our loss because this follow-up to the original Nord checks all the right boxes for its £399 / €399 price. Even more so than last year’s model, the Nord 2 feels like a pared-down flagship that covers all of the basics well, with (almost) nothing that you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8pZjK"&gt;The Nord 2 offers a 6.43-inch display with 90Hz refresh rate — a bit faster than the standard 60Hz, but not quite the buttery smoothness of a 120Hz screen. We were a little apprehensive of the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI chipset that OnePlus has opted for in favor of proven Snapdragon processors, but in testing, it was more than adequate for daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfaweu"&gt;The 4,500mAh battery will comfortably get you through a full day’s use, and although there’s no wireless charging included (not a surprise at this price), OnePlus’ signature fast wired charging is supported. With the included charger, you can power the phone from zero to fully charged in well under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZKaIkM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdTWar"&gt;OnePlus’ unfussy UI is another strong point. The Nord 2 ships with OxygenOS 11.3, and is the uncluttered, unfussy experience we’ve come to expect from OnePlus. The company says it will offer two OS upgrades and three years of security support for the Nord 2, which is a good, if not great update policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir7jlU"&gt;You won’t find the Hasselblad branding of the OnePlus 9 flagships on the Nord 2’s cameras, and that’s no great loss. What you do get is a capable camera system consisting of a 50-megapixel main stabilized rear camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a questionably useful 2-megapixel monochrome sensor, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera. Image quality is good all around — photos from the main camera lean into a slightly saturated, punchy look, but nothing distracting. Low-light photos aren’t up there with the Pixel’s, but they work in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;It’s a shame that US customers can’t pick up the Nord 2 (technically you can import it, but it won’t work properly on our wireless bands so it’s not recommended), because it’s an ideal midrange device in a lot of ways. Our loss is the rest of the world’s gain. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;If you want an inexpensive 5G phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zVN77Q"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth considering in this price bracket for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nice features like a faster refresh rate screen, the camera isn’t as good, and its software feels more cluttered and bloated. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;If budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The budget phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;If top-notch battery performance is an extremely important feature in your smartphone, then the Moto G Power should be on your shortlist. It’s capable, and you really will get multiple days of battery life on a charge. But if you’re fine getting by on a battery that’s just average, then we think you’ll be happier with a more well-rounded device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Play covers all of the basics for well under $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLkqZB"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Play (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0rkwQp"&gt;The best phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8w9H"&gt;There are plenty of options for those shopping on a tighter budget, but the Motorola Moto G Play is the one that stands out to us. It covers the basics well with a big 5,000mAh battery and a Snapdragon 460 processor that does a good enough job handling daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHIya"&gt;The G Play has a generously sized 6.5-inch screen. It’s a lower-resolution panel at 720p and is difficult to see outside in direct light, but it’s more or less just fine. Camera specs are likewise basic: there’s just one rear-facing 13-megapixel camera that performs well in bright light but isn’t well suited for low-light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXRvU"&gt;You’ll also want to strongly consider a microSD card purchase with this phone. It only includes 32GB of built-in storage, a lot of which is already occupied by system files. Motorola has only promised security updates for two years, but realistically, the G Play isn’t built to last much longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhtEOa"&gt;It has its shortcomings — the G Play’s performance doesn’t keep up with many phones that are just $50-100 more expensive, for example — but it’s hard to argue with what it does offer for its price: good, basic performance without any major flaws. If there’s flexibility in your budget to spend a little more, you’ll get some meaningful upgrades, like a better camera or a longer-lasting device. But for its price, the G Play does just what it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hides friends lists on accounts in Afghanistan as a safety measure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYATfyB4B2BfUuqogfvNcmg1lwM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753829/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook has started hiding friends lists from accounts in Afghanistan | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GezXO"&gt;Facebook’s head of security policy said the company is putting into place &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474000611573762?s=20"&gt;security measures for users in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, including hiding “friends” lists and adding a tool to quickly lock down accounts. Nathaniel Gleicher said in a thread on Twitter that Facebook made the changes based on feedback from activists, journalists, and civil society groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DN1OWo"&gt;As the Taliban have regained control of the country over the past week, the group has found ways to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/technology/taliban-social-media-bans.html"&gt;push its messages on social media&lt;/a&gt;, despite being banned by YouTube and Facebook. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/taliban-violence-drives-afghans-wipe-social-media-profiles-rcna1731"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday&lt;/a&gt; that people in Afghanistan fearful of the Taliban were deleting from their social media accounts and phones any photos that could show a connection to Western countries, the former Afghan government, or the Afghan military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P66HGR"&gt;People in Afghanistan will now have access to a one-click tool to lock down their Facebook accounts. “When their profile is locked, people who aren’t their friends can’t download or share their profile photo or see posts on their timeline,” Gleicher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474006609399811?s=20"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also removed the ability for users to view and search “Friends” lists for Facebook accounts in Afghanistan, to protect people from being targeted, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eBTs3L"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4/ We’ve launched a one-click tool for people in Afghanistan to quickly lock down their account. When their profile is locked, people who aren’t their friends can’t download or share their profile photo or see posts on their timeline. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUANh5uBgn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pUANh5uBgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nathaniel Gleicher (@ngleicher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474006609399811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BGUjHp"&gt;On Facebook-owned Instagram, Gleicher said, the company is adding pop-up alerts in Afghanistan that include steps for protecting accounts. He also urged people with friends and family in Afghanistan to tighten their own visibility settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPjGPm"&gt;Gleicher added that it’s added a special operations center “to respond to new threats as they emerge.” The company is watching the situation closely, he said. “and will take steps to help protect people in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHQUrx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="H16wid"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0lasJ"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve got a cast of Nilay, Dieter, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Allison Johnson, and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Dan Seifert. The crew discusses reviews for the Google Pixel 5A, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, and Z Fold 3, as well as some other news in the tech world like the T-Mobile data breach that exposed the personal info of more than 47 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7GZar"&gt;In the second half of the show, Alex, Dieter, and Nilay discuss the tech news you may have missed — like Intel’s new PC gaming GPUs, Facebook’s new metaverse conferencing software, and the interesting emails revealed from Apple, Google, and Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
