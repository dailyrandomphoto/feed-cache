    <title>Tesla ordered to pay $137 million to former worker over racism and hostile workplace</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AFDC2x"&gt;A jury in California has ordered Tesla to pay $137 million in damages to a Black former elevator operator after he experienced a hostile work environment, including racial harassment and discrimination, at the company’s Fremont plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cLXri"&gt;Owen Diaz worked at the plant between June 2015 and May 2016 as a contractor, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/tesla-must-pay-137-million-to-ex-worker-over-hostile-work-environment-racism.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/04/tesla-discrimination-case/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Diaz told the court that “daily racist epithets” were used in the plant, including the n-word; that racist graffiti and cartoons appeared in his workspace and the toilets; and that he was told to “go back to Africa” by colleagues. Supervisors failed to consistently intervene in these issues, said Diaz, and the stress of the situation caused him to suffer weight loss and “sleepless nights.” As reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-04/tesla-ordered-to-pay-137-million-for-harboring-workplace-racism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he told the jury: “Some days I would just sit on my stairs and cry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QoXMCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe that’s the largest verdict in an individual race discrimination in employment case”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T0jRB1"&gt;The judgement is unusual for a number of reasons. First, because of the amount of damages awarded by the judge ($130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress). “I believe that’s the largest verdict in an individual race discrimination in employment case,” David Oppenheimer, a clinical professor of law at Berkeley Law, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. And second, because the case took place in an open court at all. Like many Silicon Valley companies, Tesla often forces workers to agree to &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-arbitration-epidemic/#epi-toc-13"&gt;mandatory arbitration&lt;/a&gt; to resolve workplace disputes, meaning they can’t directly sue the company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMBTI0"&gt;Activist Tesla shareholders have complained about the company’s use of arbitration for years, saying it stifles cases like these. “The use of mandatory arbitration provisions limits employees’ remedies for wrongdoing, precludes employees from suing in court when discrimination and harassment occur, and can keep underlying facts, misconduct or case outcomes secret and thereby prevent employees from learning about and acting on shared concerns,” said one group, Nia Impact Capital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000121465921009522/j913212px14a6g.htm"&gt;recent shareholder proposal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Jr6D"&gt;Despite this, Tesla has faced &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html"&gt;numerous allegations&lt;/a&gt; of racial discrimination and harassment at its Fremont plant. Tesla reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611725/tesla-paid-1-million-black-former-employee-racist-slur"&gt;paid $1 million&lt;/a&gt; to another former employee, Melvin Berry, who said he was called the n-word by a supervisor, and the company currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;faces a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging racism at the same facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EViLqD"&gt;In response to the verdict in Diaz’s case this week, Tesla’s vice president of people, Valerie Capers Workman, sent an email to employees later published as a &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/regarding-todays-jury-verdict"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Workman says that when Diaz complained about harassment “Tesla stepped in and made sure responsive and timely action was taken,” but acknowledges a number of incidents took place, and notes that “[t]he Tesla of 2015 and 2016 (when Mr. Diaz worked in the Fremont factory) is not the same as the Tesla of today.” Workman did not say whether Tesla plans to appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is BGP, and how might it have helped kick Facebook off the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUX_U2aTbKaCicm0z-2jikMkx6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950766/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06o5Y9"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Facebook was completely knocked offline&lt;/a&gt;, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"&gt;a few other websites&lt;/a&gt;) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is on its way back up, but this all begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there’s a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP’s job is to show them the way and make sure it’s the best route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBANNl"&gt;I’ve heard BGP described as a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;system of post offices&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjkU7Hw2TY4"&gt;air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt;, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dsS9q9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGE7t8"&gt;When it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they’re networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what’s responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVV2vk"&gt;Since the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don’t want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it’d be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They’ll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they’ve made to their maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QFYfuw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turn left into the river&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwhMP"&gt;Using maps as a framework, it’s easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it’s not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn’t caught, that mistake will end up on everyone’s map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we’ll get to those in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt174N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn2Yhp"&gt;Of course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can’t talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that’s the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1vLb7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHByP"&gt;Right! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn’t always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;cost can be a factor as well&lt;/a&gt;, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1M9KLB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKHu1I"&gt;Also, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to &lt;a href="https://palousetocascadestrail.org/maps.html"&gt;plan a trip&lt;/a&gt; where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it’s that hard to pin down for a “town” that has all of five roads, imagine what it’s like &lt;em&gt;trying to connect the entire internet together&lt;/em&gt;. Real roads don’t change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1hup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUWdq"&gt;I’ll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqmwFa"&gt;But Facebook didn’t! In fact, it’s built its own BGP system, which lets it do “fast incremental updates,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-abhashkumar.pdf"&gt;a paper presented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the system the company describes there is meant for communication &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; data centers — at this point, it’s hard to say what caused Facebook’s problems on Monday, and it’d take someone smarter than me to say whether Facebook’s datacenter communications could cause this kind of issue. Cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;Bryan Krebs claims&lt;/a&gt; that the outage was caused by a “routine BGP update.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoGOJr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/"&gt;InFacebook’s engineering update&lt;/a&gt;, it said that the issue was caused by “configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers.” That then led to a “cascading effect on the way [Facebook’s] data centers communicate, bringing [its] services to a halt.” At least to my eye, it reads like the problem was Facebook communicating within itself, not to the outside world (though that can obviously cause a worldwide outage, given &lt;a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2016/04/14/facebook-now-owns-domain-name-registrar/"&gt;how much of its own network stack&lt;/a&gt; Facebook controls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wo7RY5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHfYUbKNEyc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xoON2I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does DNS have to do with all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGuWsc"&gt;To borrow &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/"&gt;an explanation from Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: DNS tells you where you’re going, and BGP tells you how to get there. DNS is how computers know what IP address a website or other resource can be found at, but that knowledge itself isn’t helpful — if you ask your friend where their house is, you’re still probably going to need GPS to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1Pfe6"&gt;Cloudflare also has a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;great technical rundown&lt;/a&gt; of how BGP errors can also mess up DNS requests — the article is specifically about Monday’s Facebook incident, so it’s worth a read if you’re looking for an explanation of what it looked like from an autonomous system’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5gSi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can go wrong with BGP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulglag"&gt;Many things. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;According to Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, two notable incidents include a Turkish ISP accidentally telling the entire internet to route its traffic to its service in 2004 and a Pakistani ISP accidentally banning YouTube worldwide after trying to do so only for its users. Because of BGP’s ability to spread from autonomous system to autonomous system (which, as a reminder, is one of the things that makes it so darn useful), one group making a mistake can cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="opwgjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is sometimes called the duct tape of the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAmSlc"&gt;One group getting owned can also cause problems — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275982/myetherwallet-hack-bgp-dns-hijacking-stolen-ethereum"&gt;hackers were able to hijack requests to Amazon’s DNS&lt;/a&gt; and steal thousands of dollars in Ethereum by compromising a separate ISP’s BGP servers. Amazon wasn’t the one hacked, but traffic meant for it ended up somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUS9AS"&gt;Or, you can mess it up and delete your entire service off the internet with a bad BGP update. BGP is lovingly called the duct tape of the internet, but no adhesive is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nLdTL"&gt;So what happened to Facebook?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FZM7pm"&gt;It seems like Facebook’s servers, for some reason, told everyone to take them off their maps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;Facebook has issued an initial report&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s light on details — it’s possible Facebook plans on releasing a more in-depth explanation later, saying why the changes were made, but this may also be the last we hear about it (at least officially). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNQyrK"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176"&gt;Cloudflare’s CTO&lt;/a&gt; reports that the service saw a ton of BGP updates from Facebook (most of which were route withdrawals, or erasing lines on the map leading to Facebook) right before it went dark. One of Fastly’s tech leads tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryan505/status/1445072241256013828"&gt;Facebook stopped providing routes to Fastly&lt;/a&gt; when it went offline, and &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/"&gt;backs up the idea&lt;/a&gt; that it was some update to Facebook’s BGP that knocked out its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksYqld"&gt;I’d recommend &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;Cloudflare's explanation&lt;/a&gt; if you want nitty-gritty technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx49q6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If BGP was the problem, how does Facebook fix it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReG75S"&gt;Given that the outage went on for hours, the answer seems to be “not easily.” Facebook needed to make sure that it was advertising the correct records and that those records were picked up by the internet at large. In other words, it needed to make sure its maps were right and that everyone could see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccYKNf"&gt;That’s easier said than done, though. There were reports of Facebook employees &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057"&gt;being locked out from badge-protected doors&lt;/a&gt; and of employees struggling to communicate. In situations like these, you not only have to figure out who has the knowledge to solve the problem, and who has the permissions to solve the problem, but how to connect those people. And when your entire company is dead in the water, that’s no easy task — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;received reports&lt;/a&gt; of engineers being physically sent to a Facebook data center in California to try to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dEvABc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Locked out and totally down: Facebook is scrambling to fix massive outage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETZccb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would Web3 solve this problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKifo"&gt;Stop it. I will cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JHHM"&gt;But to quickly answer the question, probably not — even if Facebook hopped on the decentralized train, there’d still have to be some protocol telling you where to find its resources. We’ve seen that it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/"&gt;misconfigure or mess up blockchain contracts&lt;/a&gt; before, so I’d be a bit suspicious of anyone who said that a contract and blockchain-based internet would be immune to this kind of issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sIC21"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure was fishy timing on that outage given all the bad Facebook news, huh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjEq4n"&gt;Right, so obviously, the fact that this all happened while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;a whistleblower was going on TV and airing out Facebook’s dirty laundry&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to come up with alternative explanations. But it’s just as possible that this is an innocent mistake that some (very, very unfortunate) person on Facebook’s IT staff made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uimo91"&gt;For what it’s worth, that’s Facebook’s explanation. It lays the blame on a “faulty configuration change” that it made, not any devious hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wxu2O4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:44PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information from Facebook’s official engineering post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0Qx5icf91JlXCq-1SEPtG9q6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948694/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dY4v4"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;issued an explanation for the outage on Monday evening&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it was due to a configuration issue. The company says it doesn’t believe any user data was impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC6Rko"&gt;After failing all tests for most of the day, a test of ISP DNS servers via &lt;a href="http://DNSchecker.org"&gt;DNSchecker.org&lt;/a&gt; showed most of them successfully finding a route to &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; at 5:30PM ET. A few minutes later, we were able to start using Facebook and Instagram normally; however, it may take time for the DNS fixes to reach everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="edlDtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook engineers were dispatched to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” Mike Schroepfer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;who will step down from his post as CTO next year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdUNeh"&gt;Inside Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;the outage has broken nearly all of the internal systems employees use to communicate and work&lt;/a&gt;. Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts, though employees can’t receive emails from external addresses. Employees who were logged into work tools such as Google Docs and Zoom before the outage can still use those, but any employee who needs to log in with their work email was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht1q2C"&gt;Facebook engineers have been sent to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem, according to two people familiar with the situation. That meant the outage, already Facebook’s most severe in years, could be further prolonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l3G5TB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook down right now?

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems were widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms were unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXykPn"&gt;Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — were suddenly “withdrawn from the internet.” While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over last night’s whistleblower report, there isn’t any information yet to suggest anything malicious is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; was flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely told us that something went wrong. The problem also affected its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users could load games they already have installed, and the browser works, but social features or installing new games didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhSAXC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXsyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, along with internal Facebook updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ06Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted outage is still ongoing, added information about the 2019 outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGZJ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNS updates suggest Facebook is closing in on a solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av16YP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoEdQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Facebook’s explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has finally given a reason for the six-hour outage Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4kYBh37I-MdRI8PBOYrNAuIkJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69951874/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook was down for six hours on Monday | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjLRIN"&gt;Facebook said &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/"&gt;in a blog post Monday night&lt;/a&gt; that the six-hour outage that took it offline along with Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp, and OculusVR was the result of a configuration change to its routers — not of a hack or attempt to get at user data. The explanation doesn’t give much in the way of detail, but it seems like Facebook’s machines weren’t able to talk to one another — Facebook says that “this disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3ZlIa"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113957526871061"&gt;posted an apology&lt;/a&gt; Monday evening, saying the platforms were coming back online. “Sorry for the disruption today — I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLgOdz"&gt;The outage began around 11:40AM ET Monday, and led to widespread problems for the company. It was Facebook’s worst outage since 2019, when the site was down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. Employees were unable to connect with each other on company message boards, and some told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were using work-provided Outlook email accounts to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egDXnz"&gt;The problems appeared to begin with a routine BGP update that went wrong, wiping out the DNS routing information that Facebook needs to allow other networks to find its sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XS6dHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is BGP, and how might it have helped kick Facebook off the internet?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MyDIVm"&gt;Facebook’s outage came a day before whistleblower Frances Haugen was set to testify before Congress about her experiences at the company. Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who worked on its Civic Integrity group, provided a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;trove of internal Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; to reporters at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;She &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; 60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook “pays for its profits with our safety.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, Is It Down, and tons of other sites were struggling due to the Facebook outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufVdtjvxagzzrODMeyYf-yQ1-Pg=/315x0:1728x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949303/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.06.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOH1L8"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;something like Facebook drops off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, there are massive knock-on effects. For example, a website that’s meant to tell you if services are down, called Is It Down Right Now, struggled mightily under the load of people trying to see Instagram’s status. Cloudflare, a company that runs a DNS service (DNS acts like a map for your web browser when it’s trying to find a website and is also the likely culprit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;when it comes to major outages&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?s=20"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had to mobilize extra resources to keep up with the traffic of people trying to load Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp) over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpJzYZ"&gt;If you need to check if other sites are down, you do still have options. There’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;the venerable DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com"&gt;Down for Everyone or Just Me&lt;/a&gt; (DFEOJM informed me that it’s not just me having issues with Is It Down). I’m going to need all of you to decide between yourselves how to split up traffic between these two sites, so we don’t crash them too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZ91u_y2HjJ9H1v0YamzWdO_0Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900268/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.11.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a little awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="opQCm8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now, here's the fun part. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; runs a free DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1, and lots of people use it. So Facebook etc. are down... guess what happens? People keep retrying. Software keeps retrying. We get hit by a massive flood of DNS traffic asking for &lt;a href="https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6"&gt;https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDItZX"&gt;Of course, with Facebook down, we all needed something to do with our time. Twitter’s official account (as well as Jack Dorsey himself) was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"&gt;happy to poke fun at the situation&lt;/a&gt;, but every site has its limit. As a result, Twitter broke for some users too. The company’s status page &lt;a href="https://api.twitterstat.us/incidents/8tvtkby1svkv"&gt;says it had an issue with its API&lt;/a&gt;, which has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVoVsBAqXvyYMCvMgwr4fbt9QoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900720/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_12.49.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graph: DownDetector&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well NOW what do I do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wiY7iP"&gt;In the hacking world, there’s something called a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, where attackers basically pool together tons of computing resources and use them to generate tons of traffic to a website. If they’ve got enough power, the website will go down — and that’s very likely what’s happened with Is It Down Right Now, except instead of malicious hackers, it’s half the internet accidentally overwhelming the service through sheer combined will. I guess that’s what happens when &lt;a href="https://status.fb.com"&gt;Facebook’s status page&lt;/a&gt; goes down along with the rest of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="26rWHQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When Facebook goes down, an economy goes with it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A3SNbY"&gt;PS: there’s one funny side effect that comes from many people basically only using their internet connections for Facebook — many ISPs and cellular providers, like &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and more, have also been reported as down, even though their services seem to be working fine. But because people can’t access Facebook, they may assume the problem is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXUsUx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:56PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about Twitter also experiencing problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyi1Jd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 8:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect the end of Facebook’s outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing Facebook is bad, but losing WhatsApp is worse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRVNFgk3sROfsC8ae00ZkoepJw4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950894/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZUIMDs"&gt;In the chaos of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Monday’s Facebook outage&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to lose sight of the company’s reach. Not being able to post a new photo to Instagram is an annoyance, but it's not necessarily catastrophic. Yet for WhatsApp users, especially outside of the US, losing Facebook’s encrypted messaging service is a life-halting change, and one competing messaging services were eager to capitalize on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59GmX"&gt;In February last year, WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook"&gt;announced it had 2 billion users worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Compare that to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-whatsapp-tops-2-billion-users-ceo-vows-to-defend-encryption-11581516000"&gt;original flavor Facebook’s 2.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; and it's easy to see how many lives WhatsApp touches. It’s become the default method to contact people in plenty of countries, including around 400 million unique monthly users in India &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-09/facebook-fb-plans-to-turn-messaging-app-whatsapp-into-a-moneymaking-business"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. That goes beyond casual communication, as well: WhatsApp is also focused on becoming a critical tool for business. The app already takes in-app payments in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, WhatsApp claimed in October 2020 that &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;175 million people globally&lt;/a&gt; used its app to message businesses every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AahLzX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When Facebook goes down, an economy goes with it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cmA10w"&gt;With WhatsApp down, that means calls and messages to friends and family can go unanswered, customer service requests unaddressed, and vital organizing information undisseminated. The secure messaging app is frequently also one of many tools &lt;a href="https://qz.com/africa/1916319/how-nigerians-use-social-media-to-organize-endsars-protests/"&gt;organizers use to lead demonstrations and protests&lt;/a&gt; (unless &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cubans-protest-government-cracks-internet-access-messaging-apps-rcna1400"&gt;it’s blocked&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SDE39"&gt;A WhatsApp outage is a huge problem for the people who rely on it, but a possible boon for competing encrypted messaging apps. The major players, Signal, Telegram, and at least in the US, iMessage, all stand to benefit when Facebook and WhatsApp fumble. So far at least, only Signal has taken a public victory lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MjQU0k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Signups are way up on Signal (welcome everyone!) We also know what it’s like to work through an outage, and wish the best for the engineers working on bringing back service on other platforms &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mondays?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#mondays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1445062426739855366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWebeC"&gt;The company wasn’t able to disclose specific figures to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but did say that Signal was hitting levels of new sign-ups, “on par with January of this year.” The same month, I’ll note, when WhatsApp rolled out its controversial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;new privacy policy for business messages&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook at large came under fire yet again for the role it may have played in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;January 6th riots at the Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. Telegram and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUvISx"&gt;Facebook is restoring its services and it’ll take more time before we can really know how many people the Facebook outage negatively impacted. For now though, it’s safe to say it was probably a lot more annoying than not being able to update your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBIQNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gloomhaven and other popular tabletop games are on Amazon’s Deal of the Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_nJtG9igkBphOunlm5cM-Zs3bRw=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950797/gloomhaven_3_2048x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven is like a ready-to-play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign in a box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cephalofair Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CvhCV9"&gt;Amazon has billed today’s Deal of the Day as its “Epic Daily Deal,” and the shoe certainly fits when it includes one of the most epic RPG-in-a-box titles of all time. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZXVN4P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/em&gt; is currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;, tying its all-time low price of $85 just for today. This shaves 40 percent off its usual MSRP of $140. If you have ever considered playing &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; but could never get one of your friends to buckle down and put in the work as gamemaster, &lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/em&gt; might be the perfect solution for you and up to three friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UowpcB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQRFyn"&gt;The cardboard gaming deals don’t end there, with plenty of lighter and easily approachable titles also on sale. If you’re partial to simple games that use cards and dice and can be learned and played in less than an hour, consider &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragonwood-Game-Dice-Daring-Board/dp/B00UB7OV7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragonwood&lt;/em&gt; for only $10&lt;/a&gt;. Are you a murder mystery fan? You can pick between two &lt;em&gt;Cold Case &lt;/em&gt;games by ThinkFun to solve, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThinkFun-Cold-Case-Murder-Mystery/dp/B0937P214V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Story to Die For&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThinkFun-Cold-Case-Murder-Mystery/dp/B0937P8DBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pinch of Murder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — each just $10. Prefer something totally unique? Grow trees in the beautifully designed game of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Orange-Games-Photosynthesis-Strategy/dp/B074K5W5N5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photosynthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $23. Want to play co-operatively with friends and family in a fantastical game of exploration and survival against the elements? Gamewright’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-317-Forbidden-Island-Card/dp/B003D7F4YY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbidden Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-415-Forbidden-Desert-Board/dp/B00B4ECHJI?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbidden Desert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are amazing introductions to getting newer players into designer board games, and they’re only $14 and $17, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZizj1"&gt;If some of those titles are relative unknowns to you, this one might need no introduction. &lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; helped create the era of modern tabletop and board games we currently live in. It has been an institution of the gaming world since it was released in 1995 and has maintained popularity and influence throughout the years. There are many expansions and spin-offs, as well as myriad games taking inspiration from it. The base game of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studios-cantan2017/dp/B00U26V4VQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; is currently on sale at Amazon for just $30&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studio-CN3222-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B08CD3QS55?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;25th Anniversary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is $52&lt;/a&gt;, and some further expansions range from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studios-CN3072-Extension-Player/dp/B00U26V9CU?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$16&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Cities-Knights-Conquerors-Scenario/dp/B084HNCLRV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FpFL4X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10619476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7MRJzH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789660"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fh6Zn2"&gt;There are so many great games to choose from, with enough variety in genres that should satisfy classic and modern board game fans alike. Here are a few more highlight titles we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ubuLb5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook is coming back after a six-hour outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bO6n6A12PstmdlZ_bKNj5QNRsfE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950524/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KZnXEX"&gt;Facebook is back online after a six-hour outage due to DNS routing problems. The outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;took down Instagram, Whatsapp, Messenger, and Oculus VR as well&lt;/a&gt;. For some, those services are back online now; however, after a DNS issue like this, it could take hours for everything to work properly on every network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMf0Bi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook: “We appreciate your patience as we come back online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="egDXnz"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET on Monday. It was the most significant outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. Journalist Brian Krebs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;cites a trusted source&lt;/a&gt; who told him the incident didn’t have any malicious origins. Instead, they said it started with a routine BGP update that went wrong, wiping out the DNS routing information that Facebook needs so that other networks can find its sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKbjdv"&gt;However, the problem meant remote users could access the network to use it, and the people on site didn’t have the network access necessary to repair things. This mirrors an anonymous account of the issue posted earlier to Reddit (and quickly deleted), which cited pandemic protocols as a reason fewer people were on location than usual, slowing restoration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne says to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement, “To everyone who was affected by the outages on our platforms today: we’re sorry. We know billions of people and businesses around the world depend on our products and services to stay connected. We appreciate your patience as we come back online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8vO2I"&gt;Inside Facebook, the outage broke internal systems as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;leaving employees unable to get into offices and communicate easily with each other&lt;/a&gt;. Some told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were using work-provided Outlook email accounts, allowing Facebook workers to email each other but unable to send or receive emails from external addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N6W6xQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Facebook services coming back online now - may take some time to get to 100%.  To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445158381845729282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P430tL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Locked out and totally down: Facebook’s scramble to fix a massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K7m-20zYszke0f6MiKESYTZYClI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950350/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo6zhu"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;prolonged, global outage&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook’s apps sent the company’s engineers scrambling to fix the issue at one of its data centers in California, according to two people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrorXh"&gt;The outage, which began around 11:40AM ET on Monday, brought down all of Facebook’s apps — including Instagram and WhatsApp — globally, affecting billions of users and millions of advertisers. Inside Facebook, the outage also broke nearly all of the internal systems that employees use to communicate and work. As of 6PM ET, it appears that most of the services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;are back online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8vO2I"&gt;Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts since Facebook mainly runs on an internal version of the social network that is currently not accessible. While employees could email each other, they couldn’t send or receive emails from external addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifKzix"&gt;Since Facebook requires employees to log in with their work accounts to access tools such as Google Docs and Zoom, those services also weren’t working, leading some employees to use alternative services like Apple’s FaceTime and Discord. Employees who were already authenticated with non-Facebook tools like Google Docs before the outage began still had access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PH7EK"&gt;Facebook engineers were sent to one of its main US data centers in California to restore service, meaning the fix couldn’t be done remotely. Further complicating matters, the outage temporarily broke the ability for some employees to access company buildings and conference rooms with their badges, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported that engineers had been dispatched to the data center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ai95SQ"&gt;In an email to employees sent shortly after service was restored, CTO Mike Schroepfer said the issue was “affecting our networking backbone that connects all our data centers together&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrRoPF"&gt;“If you are not actively working on the recovery, please be patient and don’t rush to reload everything to prevent slowing down the bring up” of the network, he cautioned in the memo that was seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEWmar"&gt;Facebook hasn’t provided a detailed explanation of the outage, though outside experts are saying it was due to an issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"&gt;with the networking technology BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mldgRd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPWjGp"&gt;Late Monday, Facebook’s VP of Infrastructure, Santosh Janardhan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;published a corporate blog post&lt;/a&gt; saying the outage was the result of a “faulty configuration change,” adding that the company has “no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXBEGq"&gt;“Our engineering teams have learned that configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication,” &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/"&gt;Janardhan wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B9425"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:33PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that the outage is ending as Facebook and its other services are coming back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs4iEM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 8:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more information about the outage that was shared with Facebook employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frRCEV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 9:06PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the confirmed report that an angle grinder was used to access the server cages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6mMym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction October 4th, 9:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this story included a confirmed report that Facebook used an angle grinder to access the server cages. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeisaac/status/1445196576956162050?s=21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reporter has since withdrawn confirmation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and we have removed the claim from this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpW38J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:29PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more details from Facebook about the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin has a new demo, and it’s awesome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJ0tgZ6YgXzko2zHyZQG6xpLu1o=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950702/02_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvjZUG"&gt;Square Enix released&lt;em&gt; Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://square-enix-games.com/sopffo/en-us/#trialversion"&gt;second demo&lt;/a&gt;, showing off a little bit more of what we can expect from the action-oriented &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff. The demo gets... interesting. In one cutscene, Jack, the main character, peaced out after a boss fight in hilarious fashion. Players shared the cutscene all over social media with an air of alarmed confusion, but I am here to state for the record that if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; is going to be like that moment, this game is going to kick so much ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hazmmF"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, fans were a bit surprised since the game is being developed by Team Ninja of &lt;em&gt;Dead or Alive&lt;/em&gt; fame. Team Ninja is also behind the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt;-ification of franchises like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem, &lt;/em&gt;as well as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Other_M"&gt;the most controversial &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. From its pedigreed developer, whatever form &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; was going to take, it was going to be unlike anything the franchise had ever seen — and that’s a good thing. The &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series has been around for almost 35 years, and it’s refreshing to see Square Enix continue to try new things. Square Enix has done new and weird things with its IP (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689462/nintendo-direct-september-2021-trailers-announcements"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chocobo GP&lt;/em&gt; anyone?&lt;/a&gt;), but I’d argue a spinoff action game hasn’t been seen since the likes of 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtHmv6"&gt;That’s the vibe I get playing &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; — like it’s Square Enix’s attempt to relitigate the merits of &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt; while adding a dash of &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; for flavor. There’s a break gauge that functions almost like &lt;em&gt;Sekiro&lt;/em&gt;’s posture gauge — depleting it makes enemies vulnerable to special finishers, but you are similarly vulnerable if your break gauge depletes. In a growing market of Soulslike games, &lt;em&gt;Strangers In Paradise&lt;/em&gt; fits. While not being quite as hard as the famously difficult From Software games, &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; asks a little bit more critical thinking from its players. You cannot spam attacks like you can in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and expect to walk out alive. And once you get the hang of changing combos and switching jobs, the combat is pretty cool. There’s also a relentless gloominess present in &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise &lt;/em&gt;that was in &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. But unlike &lt;em&gt;Dirge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; seems to be self-aware of its edgelordiness to comedic effect. Take the gameplay clip that’s gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8QtBvJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWUwqF947rA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12OmvU"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;. There is something so relatable to Jack — not Squall, not Cloud, not Lighting, but... &lt;em&gt;Jack&lt;/em&gt; — essentially throwing up deuces and making his exit while sick tunes blare from his earbuds. In this one moment, Jack became the millennial &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; protagonist. He’s masked up, pissed off, and finds himself outnumbered and outgunned on a seemingly futile quest to defeat an oppressive and eternal evil while toothy assholes block his path. No, seriously — one way you progress through a zone is by destroying what are essentially tooth-ringed, pulsing butthole monsters. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;That’s a butthole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIKSG9"&gt;Is this just a poorly conceived monster idea or a well-crafted meditation on the kind of people who block humanity’s progress? You be the judge. I know the conversation around &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&lt;/em&gt; centers on a cutscene people might interpret as cringe, but that cringe accompanies a demo that’s weirdly compelling and a great new direction for the seminal franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXTLss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin &lt;/em&gt;releases on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC March 18, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
