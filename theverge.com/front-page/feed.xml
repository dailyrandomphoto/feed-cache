    <title>Netflix will make you savor two of its reality shows with a weekly release schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDVhxAbTU8uxm-1_6IbLVDfCj5c=/222x0:1848x1084/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014156/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_1.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ei4fT0"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-circle-and-too-hot-to-handle-return-this-spring"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be experimenting with the release schedules of two reality TV shows, &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/circle-too-hot-to-handle-modified-release-netflix"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of releasing all of the episodes at once, it will release them over the course of a month, with each show having a batch of episodes released on Wednesdays, then releasing the finale by itself at the end of the run. This means you won’t be able to binge all of the episodes in a single weekend... and that may be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mW3XY"&gt;These shows aren’t the first time Netflix has broken away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453220/netflix-arrested-development-return-television-landscape"&gt;the binge model it popularized&lt;/a&gt;, in which all of the episodes of a show are released at once. It has released episodes of cooking competition &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;music contest &lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Flow &lt;/em&gt;on a weekly basis. With&lt;em&gt; The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, though, Netflix is making a statement that it’s experimenting and trying to give people time to “dissect and dish” the events of the show. In other words, it’s giving people time to gossip about what happened and what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXqKem"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaW6N"&gt;There is a benefit to having people talking about your show for a month, rather than only for a weekend. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039496/the-witchers-success-netflix-binge-watch-release-strategy-game-of-thrones-mandolorian-weekly"&gt;arguably ran into this problem with &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the show’s writing seeming better suited to weekly viewing rather than an eight-hour marathon. That’s especially true for a reality show like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor,&lt;/em&gt; with drama ratcheting up until a big finale. That’s the type of thing you’d want to keep people talking about — and maybe subscribing to your service to see what all the fuss is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brcW0L"&gt;That’s the type of effect Netflix could be trying to replicate. Reality TV lends itself especially well to a slow burn, keeping the internet buzz alive. Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;instead of all at once&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t become cultural touchstones like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;did, there is a chance the release schedule will let them become bigger than they would’ve if we had all watched them over a weekend and then moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AymYXB"&gt;I’m not trying to say that Netflix will (or should) switch to the weekly release model for its future narrative shows. Yes, Disney was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188654/mandalorian-episodes-finale-release-time-spoilers-game-of-thrones"&gt;very successful using that model with&lt;em&gt; The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but those shows also had a lot going for them, and Netflix has a history of successfully releasing narrative shows all at once: the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046412/netflix-witcher-henry-cavill-games-books-fandom-binge-ip-competitors"&gt;was still well-received&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;was an inescapable cultural force for a while there. It’s also worth noting that narrative shows and reality TV are very different formats, and it could make sense to have different release plans for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukvslx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Circle &lt;/em&gt;is a game show about being isolated in an apartment and using only social media to connect with others (weirdly prescient for a show &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(British_TV_series)"&gt;that first aired in 2018&lt;/a&gt;), and it will start showing on April 14th, with the finale releasing on May 5th. It seems like Netflix is planning a similar release schedule for &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, a show where people try to date each other without any PDA, but the company hasn’t released exact details about it yet, other than a release window of “June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTpTVt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow and Cruella are now coming to Disney Plus at the same time as theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq0ULJXnu8tDEvk73OtVVISRQ3Q=/0x31:1096x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013349/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_2.40.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IbU69i"&gt;Disney is &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-media-and-entertainment-distribution-announces-updates-to-summer-film-release-schedule"&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; two of its biggest 2021 releases to streaming: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; are now set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed an additional two months: it’ll now debut in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 9th, instead of the previous May 7th release date. (&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; is still set to release on May 28th.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5106iu"&gt;Additionally, Disney announced further changes to its schedule: Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; will now be skipping theaters entirely (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;similar to last year’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and will release on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for all subscribers with no additional fee on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ft3OgF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Black Widow in theaters July 9 and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; with Premier Access. Additional fees required. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MSLHxk6Eez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MSLHxk6Eez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1374429041877389320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2LBlW"&gt;Alongside the new release plan for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, Disney also announced new theatrical dates for several other major 2021 films. Notably, Ryan Reynolds’ &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; will now hit theaters on August 13th, and &lt;em&gt;Kingsman&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man&lt;/em&gt; will hit on December 22nd. &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt; and Agatha Christie adaptation &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/em&gt;have been pushed to 2022, hitting theaters on January 14th and February 11th, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMJo4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s delay is a particularly notable one. Originally slated to hit theaters on May 1st, 2020, it has been delayed multiple times over the past year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic’s shuttering of cinemas. And while Disney has repeatedly said that it was still hoping to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; in theaters — with the potentially $1 billion-plus box office numbers that Marvel films tend to bring in — it seems the sluggish speed of reopening theaters has forced it to consider a simultaneous streaming debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSMGmh"&gt;And while the delay to July means that Disney will have a better shot at maximizing its box office returns (the film will still be released on the big screen for those willing to brave theaters), the interconnectedness of Marvel’s sprawling film — and now, streaming show — universe means the company can only delay new entries for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvkRu2"&gt;Each change means reshuffling the entire Marvel release schedule. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, &lt;/em&gt;for example, is set to hit theaters on September 3rd now that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has taken its July date. But there are also storytelling concerns: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is all but guaranteed to tie into the upcoming &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; show (which is planned for later in 2021), which means delaying the movie could also set back Disney’s streaming shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH9Dvv"&gt;The unprecedented move by Disney to shift such prominent releases to Disney Plus also emphasized how important the streaming service is to the company’s future. As CEO Bob Chapek commented when the service hit its 100 million subscriber milestone earlier this year, Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1ccHX"&gt;The decision to release &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — like &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; before them — will help give Disney a better idea of what premium home streaming will look like going forward. And while theaters will certainly be a big part of Disney’s future release plans, one only needs to look at things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ ongoing HBO Max release experiment&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;increasingly short length&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;theatrical windows&lt;/a&gt; to see how important streaming releases will be to the future of cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="69EtRg"&gt;
&lt;aside id="K1VKrM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Half-Life: Alyx is 40 percent off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTNtZiC8_h3b1Y7K_EHXSpkp4ss=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013330/COMBINE_ELEVATOR_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4U7ijG"&gt;Valve is celebrating the anniversary of its launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by offering the best price yet on the VR-exclusive game at Steam. Normally $60 (and worth every penny), you can &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;snag it for $36&lt;/a&gt;, totaling a 40 percent discount that lasts until Wednesday, March 31st. If you’re looking for a new VR game to sink your teeth into, this is worth playing for many reasons. If the fact that is serves as the prequel to &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t enough for you, it’s the total package for a VR game, with a fantastic narrative and graphics and immersive gameplay that makes a VR headset worth owning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WAclrA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10408507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f5SHDF"&gt;Valve still gives away free copies of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; to people who purchase its Index VR headset, but this is a good deal for everyone else. This game requires a hearty gaming PC to get the most out of it, but thankfully, you no longer &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to use a wired VR headset to experience the game (though that remains the easiest option). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyMER"&gt;If you own the Oculus Quest or Quest 2, you can purchase the Virtual Desktop app from the Oculus store, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;which allows you to stream the game from your PC to the headset&lt;/a&gt; via Wi-Fi. The app is an extra $20 on top of this game’s cost, but it’s a cheap way to get a roomscale-ready VR headset that, when connected to your PC wirelessly, can play any PC VR game you have installed — &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; included. And in my opinion, it’s so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lina Khan is just the first step toward tougher US tech regulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pwkcpz_OHD5jfCePOn4K1YkAaSg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013141/acastro_170711_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kIGNoR"&gt;President Joe Biden picked one of tech’s most ardent critics, Lina Khan, to join the Federal Trade Commission on Monday. For Democrats and progressives, Khan’s nomination was a sign that the Biden administration may be the toughest one in history when it comes to tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vs6QPN"&gt;“We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition clear,” Senate antitrust committee leader Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRlOY0"&gt;Even White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said to expect more tech scrutiny from Biden earlier this year. “The president has been clear — on the campaign, and, probably, more recently — that he stands up to the abuse of power, and that includes the abuse of power from big technology companies and their executives,” Psaki said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHx6HH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg3IWE"&gt;But even if optimism is high for the incoming FTC, Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia. Khan would only be one vote on a commission of five with a tattered history of sorry settlements and deals with companies like Facebook and Google. Over the years, antitrust enforcers have been starved of the resources necessary for taking on complicated and lengthy competition cases, and there are real concerns about whether the FTC will have the resources or legal authority to take on Big Tech, no matter who’s at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv3PhU"&gt;With Khan replacing Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, Biden has one more seat to fill before Democrats have a 3-2 majority at the agency and can begin filing suits or making settlements. For the interim, Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter is leading the FTC, but Biden hasn’t announced who he’ll officially nominate to lead the agency. It’s unclear if Biden’s FTC chair will be as skeptical of tech’s market power as Khan and Slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyEgEh"&gt;Before being nominated to the FTC, Khan burst onto the antitrust scene after publishing a legal paper called the “Amazon Antitrust Paradox.” It became immediately popular with tech critics. Shortly after, Khan worked as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee’s 16-month probe into giant tech firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. That investigation produced a 400-page report from Democrats calling for new laws to better help law enforcement agencies like the FTC take on antitrust cases against tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMLANe"&gt;“My strategy is you’ll see a number of bills introduced, both because it’s harder for (the tech companies) to manage and oppose, you know, 10 bills as opposed to one,” House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8bgUX"&gt;That work is still beginning, but the House has signaled that it plans to introduce legislation that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;beef up the FTC later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Republicans and Democrats agree on &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-tech-antitrust-agenda-30a7bcc7-22ee-4897-93ec-99f6aaf577d4.html"&gt;a handful of measures&lt;/a&gt; to help the FTC take on tech. These proposals range from legislating more funding for enforcers to pay for lengthy legal battles against wealthy tech companies. &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;As Alex Kantrowitz wrote in &lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, the FTC’s budget is less than $350 million a year, while Facebook makes billions every quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ6L6U"&gt;Lawmakers have also proposed changing &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-unveils-sweeping-antitrust-bill-laying-out-her-vision-as-new-subcommittee-chair-.html"&gt;the burden of proof&lt;/a&gt; for proposed mergers so that large companies would have to prove that their acquisitions aren’t anti-competitive before they’re allowed to finalize them. This would put more of the onus on huge tech firms when they decide to buy up a nascent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7phaHX"&gt;The FTC isn’t the only agency with the authority to challenge tech monopolies. Earlier this month, the Senate confirmed Merrick Garland as US attorney general. When Garland was first nominated in January, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/big-tech-faces-a-formidable-opponent-in-merrick-garland-as-ag-190800859.html"&gt;experts pointed to his antitrust experience&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that he would crack down on Big Tech. Still, Biden has yet to nominate anyone to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that two attorneys who previously advised tech companies were in the running for the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WSQ1"&gt;Biden still has a lot of work to do before his administration truly pivots away from the Silicon Valley coziness of the Obama administration. But if the White House and Congress get to work, the FTC could pose a significant and immediate threat to the growing power of Big Tech.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grogu never stops eating, and now there’s a toy to match his appetite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3Vg2X539j-tUnVnZ8FDGuRgGR0=/0x122:1136x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012777/Hasbro_Star_Wars_Galactic_Snackin_Grogu_oop_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXz4q7"&gt;If you’ve watched even just an episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know this: Grogu is always hungry. The little guy, previously known as Baby Yoda, is constantly snacking, whether it’s on endangered frog eggs or newly spawned spider monsters. Sometimes, he just needs a nice cup of bone broth to tide him over. And soon there will be an animatronic toy to match his appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7Or18VtAUsqBySAQtxporT4qN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391912/STAR_WARS_GALACTIC_SNACKIN__GROGU___oop__6_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3GUS"&gt;Today, Hasbro announced &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/galactic-snackin-grogu"&gt;Galactic Snackin’ Grogu&lt;/a&gt; — that’s the product’s actual name — which will release in October for $79.99. You can feed him with a spoon, let him munch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612698/mandalorian-cookie-macarons-the-child-williams-sonoma-star-wars-price"&gt;some strange blue cookies&lt;/a&gt;, or just give him a bowl of live squid. Given his propensity to eat anything, even if it gets him in trouble, the limited options are probably a good thing. Hasbro says that lil’ Grogu will let you know when he likes something or “what belongs in a trash compactor.” He’s also got some force powers and can levitate his favorite toy that he stole from the Mandalorian’s ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccq2Wu"&gt;This is actually the second animatronic Grogu, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney"&gt;one last year that could coo and fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;. Hasbro’s senior design director Vickie Stratford says that when it came to creating a follow-up, “the concept of snacking opened up many fun ideas for our design and development team to create an all-new interactive experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KjH59"&gt;Hasbro says the toy will be available to preorder today at “most major retailers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming mixed reality headset will reportedly weigh less than an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-tG9aJPA9Q3VcqUo3lETRVJlvY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012767/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQUkPC"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored mixed reality headset could weigh less than 150 grams, which would make it much lighter than many other headsets on the market, according to a new research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That lighter weight might mean Apple’s headset could be easier to wear for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZQuSz"&gt;A weight of 150 grams would make Apple’s headset lighter than the Oculus Quest 2 (503 grams), Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 (645 grams), and the Valve Index (809 grams). It would be lighter than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13161506/google-vr-headset-photos-daydream-view-virtual-reality"&gt;Google’s Daydream View&lt;/a&gt;, a fabric VR headset designed to hold your phone, which weighed 220 grams. The headset could even be lighter than your iPhone, given that the standard iPhone 12 weighs 164 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tWljz"&gt;As attractively light as this headset sounds, though, it might be a while until we get to try it out for ourselves. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that the device, which may have both virtual reality and augmented reality features, won’t launch until at least 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; backed that up in February by reporting that the device could ship “as early as next year.” &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also had a drawing of what the headset could look like, including mesh fabric in the front and Apple Watch-style bands in the back, and I could see how the device could be very light if made with those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nn176"&gt;The headset, codenamed “N301,” may also have 8K displays, eye-tracking technology, and more than a dozen cameras to both track your hand movements and capture footage that can be displayed inside the headset, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. And in his new research note, Kuo reported that the device will have plastic lenses, an ultra-short focal length, and Micro-OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFOeCS"&gt;But the headset may not be cheap: Apple has apparently discussed pricing the headset at around $3,000, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported. That would make it much more expensive than the $299 Oculus Quest 2 but more affordable than the $3,500 HoloLens 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OYFR8"&gt;Apple’s device has already hit several development challenges, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, and given how far out the rumored headset is, there’s always a possibility that details about the device could change. However, Apple recently moved Dan Riccio, its former hardware chief, into a role &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272555/apple-dan-riccio-ar-vr-development"&gt;reportedly overseeing&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s AR and VR devices, which could signal the company’s commitment to launching a device sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. will return to theatrical releases in 2022, ending its HBO Max experiment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="weHquJ"&gt;Warner Bros. will return to releasing its theatrical films exclusively in theaters next year, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;ends the studio’s 2021 experiment&lt;/a&gt; of releasing major films like &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Dune&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt; simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming service and in theaters for the first 30 days they’re released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zTlA1"&gt;The news comes as part of an announcement from Warner Bros. of a new deal with Regal cinemas owner Cineworld, the second largest theater chain in the world. After over six months of shutdowns, Regal’s theaters will reopen in April, and they’ll begin showing Warner Bros. films like &lt;em&gt;Kong vs. Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; alongside their HBO Max debuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30lFZl"&gt;When Warner Bros. films come back to theaters in 2022, Regal theaters will once again have full exclusivity (with no HBO Max or paid streaming rental competition). But that exclusivity window will be for a much shorter amount of time: Regal will only have a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window, half of the 90-day standard that existed in years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np5RCk"&gt;The shortened theatrical window matches recent changes from other studios instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s devastating effects on the film business. Paramount &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;recently announced similar 45-day windows&lt;/a&gt; for its blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/paramount-cuts-down-theatrical-exclusivity-for-major-titles-to-30-45-day-window/"&gt;an even shorter 30-day window&lt;/a&gt; for smaller titles. Universal has also signed similar deals with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wall-street-is-reacting-to-cinemark-universal-theatrical-window-deal"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;: films with openings less than $50 million domestically will hit paid video services 17 days after they debut, while movies with larger opening weekends can start paid rentals 31 days after debuting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuHBjO"&gt;Disney has similarly been experimenting with day and date premium streaming releases through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;Disney Plus Premiere Access&lt;/a&gt; program, which has offered films like &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;early for an additional $30 fee. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t remove a three-hour live-streamed video of the mass shooting in Boulder</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEykZ"&gt;YouTube says the platform will not remove a controversial live-streamed video of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, despite criticism of the streamer’s tactics and commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBbeEq"&gt;“Following yesterday’s tragic shooting, bystander video of the incident was detected by our teams. While violent content intended to shock or disgust viewers is not allowed on YouTube, we do allow videos with enough news or documentary context,” YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We applied an age restriction to the content and will continue to monitor the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uemb1r"&gt;The live stream was broadcast from around the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8vn9/boulder-shooting-livestream-not-being-pulled-by-youtube"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it reached a live audience that peaked at around 30,000 people and has since been viewed around 585,000 times. The streamer, Dean Schiller, began recording inside the supermarket soon after the attack. He continued recording from outside for more than three hours, despite police requests for him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qxCUih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video has been viewed around half a million times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bM2SOR"&gt;Schiller has identified himself in the past as a citizen journalist, and in 2019, he and another videographer were &lt;a href="https://www.westword.com/news/citizen-journalists-discuss-lawsuit-against-boulder-cops-11381112"&gt;arrested and jailed for filming&lt;/a&gt; around the Boulder County Jail, following a series of videos that captured alleged police misconduct. But as &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; notes, Schiller has been criticized on several fronts for the shooting video. Some video commenters called him out for not dialing 911 or attempting to help people fleeing the building, while some &lt;a href="https://gazette.com/news/local/man-who-live-streamed-shooting-scene-at-king-soopers-well-known-to-boulder-cops/article_9d43b086-8b6a-11eb-9987-6f7ca1b5bb4c.html"&gt;other news outlets&lt;/a&gt; and anti-extremism researchers criticized him for speculating on the shooter’s motives, revealing police tactics, and briefly filming the bodies of victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5AAH"&gt;Yesterday’s shooting in Boulder left 10 people dead, and a police spokesperson &lt;a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/23/king-soopers-shooting-ahmad-al-issa-suspected-killing-10/"&gt;said the alleged killer&lt;/a&gt; was taken into custody after being shot in the leg by a police officer. Police have not offered a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTiS9"&gt;Videos of murder have created a quandary for social network moderators who are tasked with distinguishing between meaningful journalism and content that could inspire copycat attacks or play into a killer’s search for publicity. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have scrambled to remove video directly recorded by mass shooters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;including a 2019 attack&lt;/a&gt; on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. But they’ve also been criticized for &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/facebook-blames-technical-glitch-for-temporary-removal-of-falcon-heights-shooting-video/"&gt;removing video&lt;/a&gt; documenting newsworthy events like police shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2OGScb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mass shooting videos can amplify an attack’s harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWTfPh"&gt;Platforms have also responded by surfacing trusted news outlets or by limiting the reach of controversial posts, even if they’re not banned outright. But YouTube didn’t outline any specific steps it had taken on Schiller’s video beyond requiring users to log in and verify their age before viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfILwP"&gt;The video also plays into long-standing questions about how journalists should responsibly cover violence. While some YouTube comments called the video a negative byproduct of social media reporting, others drew parallels with sensationalist coverage in older mediums like TV news — comparing Schiller to the protagonist of the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbjLdF"&gt;Traditional media outlets have gradually reevaluated their playbook for reporting on mass shootings in recent years. That includes trying to avoid an inordinate focus on the shooter or unsubstantiated speculation about their motives, particularly in the early stages of an incident, when very little is known about the attack. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reportingonmassshootings.org/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; also include avoiding graphic violence that’s posted without a clear purpose — and could add to the trauma of people who have survived the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
