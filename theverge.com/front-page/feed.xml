    <title>One of the US’s largest insurance companies reportedly paid $40 million to ransomware hackers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Nmb6K"&gt;CNA Financial, one of the largest US insurance companies, paid $40 million to &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/cna-hit-novel-ransomware/165044/"&gt;free itself from a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in March, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/cna-financial-paid-40-million-in-ransom-after-march-cyberattack?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The hackers reportedly demanded $60 million when negotiations started about a week after some of CNA’s systems were encrypted, and the insurance company paid the lower sum a week later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S8zmS"&gt;If the $40 million figure is accurate, CNA’s payout would rank as one of the highest ransomware payouts that we know about, though that’s not for lack of trying by hackers: both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; had data that was compromised in separate $50 million ransomware demands earlier this year. It also seems like the hackers are looking for bigger payouts: just this week we saw reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million ransom to hackers&lt;/a&gt;. While that number isn’t as staggering as the demands made to CNA, it’s still much higher than &lt;a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/average-ransomware-payouts-shoot-up/"&gt;the estimated average enterprise ransomware demand in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fbvm5p"&gt;Law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/"&gt;recommend against paying ransoms&lt;/a&gt;, saying that payouts will encourage hackers to keep asking for higher and higher sums. For its part, CNA told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it wouldn’t comment on the ransom, but that it had “followed all laws, regulations, and published guidance, including OFAC’s 2020 ransomware guidance, in its handling of this matter.” In &lt;a href="https://www.cna.com/web/wcm/connect/96a7c7dd-96d1-41cc-8a0c-25604bfc2898/Security-Incident-Update-5-12-21.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"&gt;an update from May 12&lt;/a&gt;, CNA says that it believes its policyholders’ data were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPg36v"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the ransomware that locked CNA’s systems was Phoenix Locker, a derivative of another piece of malware called Hades. Hades was allegedly created by a Russian group with the &lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/em&gt;-esque name Evil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLBWWu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg wrote that the ransomware used against CNA was a derivative of one created by Evil Corp; we initially suggested it was Evil Corp’s original ransomware instead. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack’s newest feature will help me remember to pause notifications before calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrhi205WN4uoQ9frnFmE2twly2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319828/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3NGDD"&gt;Slack has added a small but very welcome new feature: when you’re setting a status, you can check a box in that same menu to pause notifications for as long as that status is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eCgCQ"&gt;I discovered the checkbox on Thursday while preparing for an interview. When I do interviews or calls, I like to set a status to tell my colleagues what I’m up to and then turn off Slack notifications so I’m not distracted by pings or mentions. Previously, though, pausing notifications required clicking into a second menu — and I’d sometimes forget to turn them off. This new checkbox has the benefit of saving me a bit of time and helping me remember to pause notifications when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTBaxH"&gt;Slack tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this feature is rolling out now, so you might not have it just yet. If you want to see if you do, go to the “Set a status” menu, type something in the “What’s your status?” field, and then look under the “Clear after:” menu. You should see a checkbox titled “Pause notifications.” Check that, and when you save your status, you won’t get notifications while the status is live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZpVbO_wENTOVbELEhq1lxeqiVks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529269/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_2.24.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new checkbox to pause notifications right from the status menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EuuRZV"&gt;There’s been a fair amount of Slack news within the last day or so. Earlier on Thursday, Slack had an outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446007/slack-down-outage-messages-trouble-loading"&gt;that lasted for more than an hour&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, Slack introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444705/slack-pronouns-field-profiles"&gt;pronouns field for profiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard shows off Overwatch 2’s new 5 vs. 5 multiplayer and a trio of maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6Q7e5K25ar3SCOi1L770kS9hzw=/194x0:2234x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319717/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_5.09.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uWg8lN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430644/blizzard-overwatch-2-livestream-twitch-youtube"&gt;Blizzard’s two-hour &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2 &lt;/em&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt; showed off the best look yet at the much-anticipated sequel to the competitive team shooter. And while there’s still no release date, the studio did show off plenty of new information about the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5jdU1"&gt;Chief among those is one of the biggest changes to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; in the game’s history: the sequel will be shifting the default PvP multiplayer mode from six-on-six matches to five-on-five games. Within the current role queuing system, that translates to cutting out a tank character on each team, which will now consist of two support, two DPS, and just a single tank character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IvLD9P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rock to that Rio rhythm in Overwatch 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Points of interest: &lt;br&gt;   Club Sinestesia&lt;br&gt;   Peacock Payload&lt;br&gt;   Oh!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3isScZ"&gt;The explanation behind the changes is to both simplify and shake up &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s combat and meta, which tends to calcify toward tank-centric plays, specifically based on utilizing shielding mechanics from characters like Reinhardt or Orisa. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, tank characters are getting some big buffs to make them more powerful (and to help compensate for the lack of a second tank). Reinhardt, for example, is getting a second Firestrike attack, while Winston’s Tesla coil cannon is getting a ranged alt-fire mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4qlnft"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFwHf5"&gt;The goal is to help shift &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s combat away from hiding behind / healing tanks and to give the rest of the team more room to spread out, flank, and focus on objectives (instead of just trying to keep the tanks alive). One less tank also means that players have to be smarter about the maps, utilizing cover and creative flanking angles instead of just rolling down the main path in a shield fortress. It’s a big change to the game, one that exemplifies the approach that Blizzard is taking here in terms of trying to keep things fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AKpksl"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPYVBU"&gt;The stream also showed off other new aspects in the upcoming sequel, including a better look at the cleaner UI for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; (which, among other changes, makes it easier for support characters to track teammates they’re healing), new character designs, and other tweaks that are planned for character abilities (like Mei, who won’t be able to fully freeze opponents anymore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IH4F"&gt;The development team also showcased several new maps. There was a better look at the upcoming Toronto map, which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;announced alongside &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2 &lt;/em&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but also a trio of new maps: New York, featuring a futuristic Grand Central station; Rio, which has a nightclub for the EDM hero Lúcio; and Monte Carlo, set on a winding racetrack. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury wants cryptocurrency transfers over $10,000 to be reported to the IRS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOJVgfwTEbCuWmxMUhn3ty4E5WQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319668/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3blrE"&gt;The US Treasury Department said Thursday it will require any cryptocurrency transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the IRS. “Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion,” the agency said in a new &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/The-American-Families-Plan-Tax-Compliance-Agenda.pdf"&gt;report on tax compliance proposals&lt;/a&gt;. “This is why the President’s proposal includes additional resources for the IRS to address the growth of cryptoassets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY52YU"&gt;The Treasury report said that even though cryptocurrency transactions are a small fraction of business transactions in the US, requiring large crypto transactions to be reported would help “to minimize the incentives and opportunity to shift income out of the new information reporting regime.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRWI8T"&gt;The Treasury Department plan outlined several policies aimed at increasing tax enforcement, which, in addition to the new cryptocurrency proposal, includes new reporting requirements and a big increase for the IRS’s budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egI3Lh"&gt;“At the crux of these proposals is a commitment to revitalizing tax enforcement,” according to the report. “Working to close the tax gap reflects a commitment to ending our two-tiered tax system, one where most American workers pay their full obligations, but high earners who accrue income from opaque sources often do not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6mvbq"&gt;The Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis estimated that the proposed updates would raise an additional $700 billion in tax revenue over the next 10 years and could bring in as much as $1.6 trillion in the following decade. Many of the changes the Biden administration proposes in the report would require Congressional approval, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4i8fP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9d0ld"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees call for company to support Palestinians in internal letter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ju6H8FQCl5fE3uiW5xOJRpENqGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319478/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yclD6"&gt;Apple employees are circulating an internal letter calling on Tim Cook to put out a statement supporting the Palestinian people. Nearly 1,000 workers have signed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orkeeG"&gt;The writers, who are part of the Apple Muslim Association, specifically ask the company to recognize that “millions of Palestinian people currently suffer under an illegal occupation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mzm6X"&gt;The move comes on the heels of Israel’s deadly bombing campaign in Gaza, which has killed roughly 227 people, including at least 63 children. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/israel-unleashes-strikes-after-vowing-to-press-on-in-gaza?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the Israeli government approved a unilateral cease fire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqD2tg"&gt;Members of the Apple Muslim Association — an official employee group — say they were inspired to write the note after the company failed to put out a statement condemning the violence toward Palestinians. “We are frustrated and disappointed because once more, many of those in positions of power and influence ... either choose to remain silent or release ineffectually neutral ‘both sides’ statements with regards to the Palestinian situation,’” they wrote. Historically, the company has not been quick to voice solidarity with Muslim employees or support Muslim causes, according to one current worker. (Tim Cook was, however, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump’s Muslim ban). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkmQv0"&gt;The letter was sent Monday. Apple has not yet responded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnm7IX"&gt;Discussions about the violence internally were dominated by pro-Zionist voices, sources said, with Muslim employees and allies trying unsuccessfully to turn the talks toward the plight of Palestinians and Muslim Apple workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="walB4z"&gt;The news comes two days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;a group of Jewish employees at Google&lt;/a&gt; put out a statement calling for the company to protect anti-Zionist speech. Google workers also asked that the company review its business contracts to ensure they do not enable Israeli violations of Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hkAq"&gt;On May 12th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published another internal letter&lt;/a&gt; from Apple employees, calling for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — author of the controversial book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly after publication, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuu0ic"&gt;Here is the text of the full letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uh6DGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10510681"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oqiKra"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tcile3"&gt;Belkin’s new SoundForm Connect Audio is a $99 dongle that lets you turn any pair of speakers with either a 3.5mm or optical port into an AirPlay 2-compatible setup. In other words, it’s effectively an Apple version of the (now-defunct) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9412755/google-chromecast-audio-announced-price-release-date"&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8epYR"&gt;As someone who actually likes AirPlay 2, it’s a very interesting concept, especially if you have older speakers or an audio setup that you’d like to get wired into the rest of an AirPlay system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkMrZm"&gt;Setup is simple: just plug in the SoundForm Connect Audio to power (over USB-C, thankfully), and then plug in a 3.5mm headphone jack or optical cable from your speaker system’s input port. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72RwgbepqBRSJrJ4u6w8U-eCTeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529134/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu0wFg"&gt;Unfortunately, the SoundForm Connect Audio does come with a pretty hefty price tag for what it does. The Chromecast Audio used to cost $35, which made it a pretty nice option for hooking up an old speaker to your multiroom audio setup. An Echo Dot (which is also a full-fledged smart speaker) can be hooked up to anything with a headphone jack to use with Alexa and costs $40 to $50 — not counting Amazon’s frequent sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XdsgH"&gt;But the SoundForm Connect Audio costs $99 just to add a speaker to an AirPlay 2 setup. That’s between two to three times as much, or as much as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-00357561%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea’s entry-level Symfonisk&lt;/a&gt; bookshelf speaker (which also offers AirPlay 2 support). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3WLl"&gt;Still, given that there hasn’t really been a solution for this kind of setup since Apple discontinued the AirPort Express (which offered similar functionality for the original AirPlay standard), the SoundForm Connect Audio is better than nothing. But the relatively high price means it’ll likely only be useful for owners of more expensive speaker setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0yGhD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fadapters%2Faudio-video%2Fsoundform-connect-audio-adapter-with-airplay-2%2Fp%2Fp-auz002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundForm Connect Audio&lt;/a&gt; is available to preorder now from Belkin’s website, with orders shipping later in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new privacy ad imagines Thanos-snapping your stalkers out of existence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRQCgvfwt6mkNNe6ISXkydwj5Ak=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319196/vlcsnap_2021_05_20_12h43m26s445.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xs6JLW"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; feature in iOS 14.5 doesn’t seem to be a difficult concept to grasp; initial estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;as many as 96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are leaping at the chance to tell their apps, “No, you can’t track me across the internet.” Now, Apple is taking a victory lap with a full ad campaign, too, one that turns the feature into a selling point for the iPhone and furthers the attempt to pitch itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;as the only tech company you can trust&lt;/a&gt;. And, if you ask me, its new ad spot “Tracked” is just about perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jjBXj"&gt;Just give it a watch above. Who wouldn’t want to Thanos-snap ad trackers into dust? It’s no wonder Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;thinking long and hard about following Apple’s lead&lt;/a&gt; with an anti-tracking feature of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1qIbzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"},{"title":"Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Can Apple live up to Apple’s privacy ads?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/22/21076245/apple-icloud-backup-encryption-loophole-privacy-ads-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dmdztJ"&gt;Critics claim these moves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;will make the internet more expensive&lt;/a&gt; and potentially harm small businesses, and they are updating their apps to warn you about that — as well as the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436944/twitter-ad-tracking-ios-14-5-app-transparency"&gt;that ads might be less relevant&lt;/a&gt; if you opt out. But that’s a tough sell compared to the privacy fears that exist these days, and it’s hard to argue with Apple’s idea that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;users should get to choose for themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The company also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXl5OL"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its own ad platform and apps don’t track users and that the App Tracking Transparency prompt applies to its own apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MagSafe PopSockets are here: we tested to see if they stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqlNFFCpe7-xJ9TASP5mQEOavfE=/13x0:4887x3249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319172/DSCF2173.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is bulkier than the regular PopGrips, but is easy to take off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxHvXB"&gt;MagSafe PopSockets are finally here, after the famous phone handle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225701/popsockets-magsafe-accessory"&gt;announced  they would be coming in January&lt;/a&gt;. The PopGrip for MagSafe sells for $30, which is two to three times more expensive than the adhesive versions, but the bigger question that people have been asking since the announcement is whether they’ll be as trustworthy. I decided it was time to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NcqiV"&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is a retractable grip for your phone (as the name implies) that can also work as a stand for watching video or a hands-free video call. PopSockets has made versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopGrip-Swappable-Phones-Tablets/dp/B07P29XQR4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt; for years now (and if you’ve got a collection of fun design tops, this will still work with those), but they’ve traditionally used an adhesive to attach to your device. The MagSafe version uses Apple’s system of magnets that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;it introduced on the iPhone 12 models&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with everything from the iPhone 12 Mini to the gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6swZQw"&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/METISINNO-MagSafe-Socket-Compatible-iPhone/dp/B08RDBZH6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some attempts by third parties&lt;/a&gt; to make MagSafe mounts that you can stick to your iPhone, then stick a PopSocket to, but the PopGrip for MagSafe is an integrated, first-party version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vb2ojW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UrbXV"&gt;PopSockets makes it clear on the box that this shouldn’t be used with bare iPhones, and it’s easy to see why: the iPhone’s glass back doesn’t provide a lot of grip. But sometimes the question with accessories isn’t “what do the directions say” but “can I get away with using it like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obBI70G9XJXgJXiM6dfR0iUhAXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528842/raw_phone_couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYY5rb"&gt;Looks like the answer is no! Listen to PopSockets, and do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use this thing with a bare phone. If you put it on and shake it around a few times you may get lucky and think that it’s fine, but I promise it will come off very easily at some point. Probably while you’re on some sort of perilous precipice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NaThJHHHBX8_5IWRvlmlZTpFHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528854/DSCF2160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a terrible idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yks3rD"&gt;That did make me wonder, though, what would happen if I had a plastic case that wasn’t MagSafe compatible. Would the magnets still reach through, and would the plastic be less slippery than the iPhone’s glass? I can’t answer the second question, because the answer to the first one is absolutely not. It basically just falls off, even with a reasonably thin MagSafe-less case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ct2pov0pujZLr7ES3PnUTOHAiSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528889/Non_Magcase.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIc9Z"&gt;Okay, well let’s give the PopSocket the best-case scenario: how well will it stick to Apple’s silicone MagSafe case, which has both magnets and a reasonably grippy texture?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lgZc9xYyZ9T5MwzGn4UqB0oDUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528870/Silicone_Case_Couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d call that a pass!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="47Zj35"&gt;As you can see, it’s not coming off — at least not until you want to pop it of to, say, wirelessly charge, in which case it’s actually very easy to remove. But maybe it’s just the specific way I was shaking it that let it perform so well. I will admit that I haven’t historically been a heavy PopSocket user, but I’ve been told that people put a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of faith in the PopSocket adhesive. So that made me wonder what was the silliest thing I could do to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; put the MagSafe case / PopGrip connection to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW5Siz"&gt;And obviously the answer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJchhTeDZhM"&gt;was karate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K33n3i4e3YpvbTKRvU-DWpYQZeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528824/karate_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike my form after years of not practicing, my phone is still intact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAYRD"&gt;Make no mistake, if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dislodge the PopSocket from the phone, you can. If I’m holding the phone at a perfect parallel angle to the floor and shaking with all my might, it will eventually come off, but that doesn’t seem like a terribly realistic scenario and it’s been rock-solid in all my other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut0Jkv"&gt;It’s also worth noting that I wasn’t able to test the MagSafe PopSocket with other case materials, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Leather-Case-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5NRTFJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s leather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Clear-Case-iPhone-Pro/dp/B08L5NRTRR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear plastic cases&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s hard to say if it would do as well. But it does seem that, with at least one of Apple’s cases, the MagSafe PopSocket can hang with the adhesive version. And if you use your phone with a non-MagSafe case, or no case at all? Well, you may have to stick with the sticky PopSockets, or buy a MagSafe case if you really want that sweet magnetic removability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BO7UM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 Pro could have a curved screen and a triple rear camera, new leak suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9E-SsriP6IB3EtdUWxmBEjxESQ8=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319100/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newly leaked renders suggest that Google isn’t playing it safe anymore with its next generation of Pixel devices.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYaYqP"&gt;New images from reputable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onleaks"&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/exclusive-google-pixel-6-pro-rednders-leak-display-design-camera-59483.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;digit.in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) show what may be a bold step forward for Google’s Pixel series. The Pixel 6 Pro, as pictured in the alleged renders, could offer a 6.67-inch curved display and a rear triple-camera array — a Pixel first — including a periscope-style telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Zh5G"&gt;This report also says that the 6 Pro will use an OLED screen, though there’s no confirmation of refresh rate, and will measure around 163.9 x 75.8 x 8.9mm. It’s expected to offer dual speakers and support wireless charging — features that are both available on the Pixel 5. There are some obvious differences in design, too, with the camera array moved to a raised, horizontal stripe across the back of the device and a bright accent color on the panel above it. There’s no confirmation with this leak whether the 6 Pro will include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;rumored, Google-designed “Whitechapel” SoC&lt;/a&gt; (system on a chip).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UC-GcKR-HRuFxfKOQmvNX-DYtno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528954/PIXEL_6_PRO_5K1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnLeaks and digit.in&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renders show a rear triple-camera array including a periscope telephoto lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MhZnlx"&gt;The naming shift from “XL” to “Pro” could also indicate a new relationship between the standard and big-screen models. In previous generations (the Pixel 5 never got an XL counterpart), the XL model was a “same phone, bigger screen” affair. Ditching that moniker for “Pro” could indicate that it’s both a bigger and higher-end device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTkQGB"&gt;Google has taken a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;conservative approach recently&lt;/a&gt; to its Pixel hardware and design. This hasn’t been an entirely bad thing, and it’s earned Google’s handsets a reputation for simple, affordable design with great cameras and software. But if these renders are the real deal, then the company appears to be making a move to challenge other flagships with higher-end hardware. For now, there’s no confirmed release date for the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, but we’d expect Google to stick with its typical fall timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoiiaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll be on the lookout for more opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQIMvb"&gt;Sony’s elusive PlayStation 5 console is in stock at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re one of the many people who has struggled to get one for yourself, today is looking good for you, and it’ll look better if more retailers jump in with stock later today. As usual, Walmart might not immediately appear to be selling consoles today, but you might be able to get one added to your cart if you refresh frequently. (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure your payment method and shipping address are entered ahead of time on each site before you try to buy a console. The faster you can checkout, the more likely your chance of success. Also, Walmart tends to release more consoles in 10-minute waves, so try again if 3:00PM ET doesn’t work, try again at 3:10PM ET.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpQGVG"&gt;The PS5 with a UHD Blu-ray disc drive and 1TB of built-in SSD storage costs $499.99 and is available from Walmart. Due to the disc drive, this model is slightly thicker and heavier than the digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AN08xm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQnMrc"&gt;If you want to save a little money (and a little space in your entertainment center), the PlayStation 5 digital edition without a disc drive is available for $399.99. Other than lacking the ability to play discs, this model is exactly the same as the more costly version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZVc8fy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jmX6UO"&gt;I wish you the best of luck in getting a console today. Whether you get one today, or plan to get one when the next restocking happens, there are a few must-have accessories to accompany your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="z6YELL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OlxFkn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="utPhLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ceREf8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
