    <title>How to set up two-factor authentication on your online accounts</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLYLBlBpiHxeKVyBro78kS2OuZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635030/akrales_170614_1776_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="96nXbn"&gt;Just about any account you own on the internet is prone to being hacked. After numerous widespread breaches through the past few years, tech companies have been working together to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249895/web-authentication-webauthn-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-standard-browsers"&gt;develop a standard&lt;/a&gt; that would make passwords a thing of the past, replacing them with more secure methods like biometric or PIN-based logins that do not require transferring data over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzdYrE"&gt;But while those standards are still being adopted, the next best way to secure your accounts is two-factor authentication, or 2FA. This a process that gives web services secondary access to the account owner (you) in order to verify a login attempt. Typically, this involves a phone number and / or email address. This is how it works: when you log in to a service, you use your mobile phone to verify your identity by either clicking on a texted / emailed link or typing in a number sent by an authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Go1Z1k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:6019722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LzRe1A"&gt;What are authenticator apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MtJf72"&gt;Authenticator apps are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18098286/vovox-security-breach-two-factor-authentication-2fa-codes-exposed"&gt;considered more secure than texting&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer flexibility when you’re traveling to a place without cellular service. Popular options include &lt;a href="https://authy.com/"&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en"&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Fauthenticator" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fhde-otp-generator%2Fid571240327%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D8%26at%3D10l7an&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22215571%2Ffactor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hennge OTP&lt;/a&gt; (iOS only). These apps mostly follow the same procedure when you’re adding a new account: you scan a QR code associated with your account, and it is saved in the app. The next time you log in to your service or app, it will ask for a numerical code; just open up the authenticator app to find the randomly generated code required to get past security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarOxI"&gt;While 2FA — via text, email, or an authenticator app — does not completely cloak you from potential hackers, it is an important step in preventing your account from being accessed by unauthorized users. Here’s how to enable 2FA on your accounts across the web. (We’ve listed the services in alphabetical order.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4WMChB"&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3S9Sst"&gt;Go to the Amazon homepage and log in. Hover over “Accounts &amp;amp; Lists” and click on “Account.” A box labeled “Login &amp;amp; security” will be at the top of the page, so click on that and then click the “Edit” button on “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings.” (You may be asked to reenter your password first.) You can also navigate directly to that page by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/a/settings/approval"&gt;following this link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQNtT3"&gt;Click “Get Started” and Amazon will walk you through the process of registering your phone number, or you can opt to use your preferred authenticator app by syncing it through a QR code. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start with Amazon’s “Login &amp;amp;amp; security” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvWGuauq7CG1F_uL2kEbcCNxcZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8673411/amazon_2fa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with Amazon’s “Login &amp;amp; security” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1tGC9L"&gt;You can activate 2FA on both the Android and iOS Amazon app by tapping the three-line “hamburger” menu on the left side and finding “Your Account” &amp;gt; “Login &amp;amp; security.” The same “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings” selection should be available for you to edit and toggle on 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Amazon app also lets you set up two-step verification." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BTE03PyTqVvvIvwx7jinYhHNNcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931158/Screenshot_20200428_152732__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon app also lets you set up two-step verification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use a third-party authenticator app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcGvg7BZRru-imNviPqD8VxOJWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931160/Screenshot_20200428_152813.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use a third-party authenticator app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fi3Cs"&gt;Once your phone number or authenticator app has been verified, you can select trusted devices to bypass 2FA or generate a code to log in via a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rzz8Rl"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11gB7w"&gt;Two-factor authentication is currently offered to Apple users on iOS 9 and later, and on macOS X El Capitan and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iyVQno"&gt;iOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sKeB69"&gt;The steps are slightly different depending on how updated your iOS software is. For those using iOS 10.3 or later, you can enable 2FA on your Apple ID by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; [Your Name] &amp;gt; “Password &amp;amp; Security” &amp;gt; “Two-Factor Authentication.” Turn on 2FA to receive a text message with a code each time you log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYrr8t"&gt;For those using iOS 10.2 or earlier, the settings are under “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Apple ID” &amp;gt; “Password &amp;amp; Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pKUQDC"&gt;macOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="td54Cr"&gt;Again, steps are slightly different depending on your version of macOS. If you’re using Catalina or later, click the Apple icon on the upper-left corner of your screen, then click “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Apple ID.” Click on “Password &amp;amp; Security” under your name, and then select “Turn On Two-Factor Authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtKOiS"&gt;For Mojave and earlier, after you click the Apple icon, click “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Account Details.” (You can shorten this step a bit by typing in “iCloud” using Spotlight.) Click on “Security” and you’ll see the option to turn on 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jvEv"&gt;The remainder of the steps, for iOS or Mac, are the same. You can opt for Apple to send you a six-digit verification code by text message or phone call. You can also set up a physical security key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjkK5G"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SUjv2h"&gt;From your Dropbox homepage on the web, click your profile avatar and select “Settings,” then go to the “Security” tab. Find “Two-Step Verification,” which will tell you the status of your 2FA. Toggle to turn the feature on and choose to receive 2FA through a text or your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dropbox also lets you use a text or authenticator app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnMf_xf_gWHbAYow1HIjw-lI8jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15980136/Screen_Shot_2019_03_22_at_1.37.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dropbox also lets you use a text or authenticator app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DalDSJ"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aOzHeQ"&gt;The way to access Facebook’s 2FA settings is a bit different between the app and the web (and Facebook tends to update both layouts often). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWtSB4"&gt;On the mobile app, you can access your privacy settings by tapping the hamburger icon on the upper-right corner (Android) or the lower-right corner (iOS) and scrolling down to the bottom to find the “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” menu. Tap “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security and Login” and select “Use two-factor authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqC8Js"&gt;You can opt for a text message, an authenticator app, or a security key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G48ylI"&gt;On the web, click the down arrow in the upper-right corner, and select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy Shortcuts.” Look for the “Account Security” heading and click on “Use two-factor authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you authenticate via text message, an authenticator app, or a security key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40skyR6ZXwIVmSscfb10DG0q-pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536757/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.51.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you authenticate via text message, an authenticator app, or a security key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h7lEUo"&gt;Additionally, for apps that don’t support 2FA when logging in with a Facebook account (such as Xbox and Spotify), you can generate a unique password specifically associated with that account. From the original down arrow, select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings,” and then, from the menu on the left, “Security and Login” &amp;gt; “App passwords” (under the “Two-Factor Authentication” subhead). After resubmitting your Facebook password, you’ll be able to name the app, click generate, and save that password for the next time you have to log in. Under the same “Two-Factor Authorization” subhead, you can choose specific iterations of the app (say, on your laptop) where you can forgo the login code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mj6fL8"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USZfJy"&gt;Fitbit has only recently added 2FA — in fact, as this was written, the feature was rolling out, but we haven’t seen it yet, so we haven’t been able to verify these steps. But assuming you’ve got access to the new feature, here’s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVnUYr"&gt;To turn 2FA for your Fitbit, tap on the “Today” tab in your app and then on your profile image. Select “Account Settings” &amp;gt; “Two Factor Authorization” and turn 2FA on. Fitbit will send you a text message with a verification code; once you enter that, along with your password, you’re in. (Unfortunately, Fitbit only uses text messages for verification, rather than giving you an option for an authenticator app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvaAFB"&gt;Fitbit gives you a recovery code to use in case you lose or change your phone. The company recommends that you put that code somewhere safe; if you lose the code, you can get another one by using the app to turn off 2FA and then turn it on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y1iloH"&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sgClWT"&gt;The easiest way to turn on 2FA across your Google accounts (e.g., Gmail, YouTube, or Google Maps) is by heading over to the main &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/"&gt;2FA landing page&lt;/a&gt; and clicking “Get Started.” You’ll be asked to log in and then select your mobile device from a list. (If you have an iPhone, you may have to download a separate app.) If Google succeeds in sending a message to that phone, you will be asked to enter a phone number, and then you can choose whether you want to receive verification codes by text message or phone call. Again, Google will try out your chosen method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqXTo"&gt;After that, Google will first send prompts to your phone that allow you to simply select “Yes” or “No” when a login attempt occurs. If that doesn’t work, it will send the text message or phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once two-factor is enabled, Google will send a notification asking you to authenticate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meCsWyG9ni-b3aVP0_CwixSZ6tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931218/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.48.11_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once 2FA is enabled, Google will send a notification asking you to authenticate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0G4wh5"&gt;You can also generate backup codes for offline access. Google generates 10 codes at a time and they’re designed to be single-use, so once you’ve successfully used one, cross it out (assuming you’ve printed them), as it will no longer work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r40w1c"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7W3jFx"&gt;Instagram added 2FA to its mobile app in 2017, but now you can also activate it through the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMJiDL"&gt;To activate 2FA on your mobile app, tap on your profile and select the hamburger menu on the upper-right corner. Look for “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security,” where you’ll find a menu item for “Two-Factor Authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVIq21"&gt;Here, you can choose between text message-based verification or a code sent to your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="GIF by Amelia Krales / The Verge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKSxexIkcqXfqkNlQViNqjyTZO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8700877/VRG02AK_1776_HOW_TO_2FA_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Amelia Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hJYwoA"&gt;To turn on 2FA using the web, log in to Instagram, click on your profile icon in the upper-right corner, and select “Settings” from the drop-down menu. Clicking this will pop open a settings menu, where you can find the same “Privacy and Security” section as on the app. From here, you can turn on 2FA and, just as in the app, choose your method for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the Instagram settings page, then “Privacy and Security.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAQmgXpxoalWbn0kuTvpj57JUB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536701/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.33.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the Instagram settings page, then “Privacy and Security.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1yd7WX"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y7VGEa"&gt;Log in to your Microsoft account and find the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3FLinkId%3D529561&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22215571%2Ffactor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Security settings&lt;/a&gt;” menu (there are several ways to get there; click on the link for the easiest). Look for the “Two-step verification” section and click on the setup link. You’ll be walked through the steps needed to use either the Microsoft Authenticator app or a different authentication app. You’ll also be able to create passwords for apps that don’t accept 2FA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="izBJXc"&gt;Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DSl8"&gt;Smart home products like Nest are not exempt from getting hacked. Current Nest users will have signed in to the app via their Google accounts, and so will be using Google’s 2FA feature (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jirQ16"&gt;If you’ve resisted migrating your existing Nest account to your Google account, you may still be able to use 2FA. On the home screen, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Account” &amp;gt; “Manage account” &amp;gt; “Account security,” and select two-step verification. Toggle the switch to on. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dVQRg"&gt;Keep in mind that all of your devices will be automatically signed out, so you’ll have to sign in again using two-step verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVOKMf"&gt;If all your family members don’t have their own logins and have been using yours, it’s a good idea to set them up with separate logins using Family Accounts. Otherwise, when they try to log on using two-step verification, the necessary code will be sent to your phone, not theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fJBuLy"&gt;PayPal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swH76g"&gt;On the main Summary page, click the gear icon and select the “Security” tab. Look for the section called “2-step verification” and click on the “Set Up” link. You’ll be able to choose whether to have a code texted to you or to use an authenticator app. (PayPal also offers to find an authenticator app if you want one.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PayPal will offer to find an authenticator app if you don’t have one." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHK7Ab5cjB07etE3MHnOaZr08R4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538569/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.41.09_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal will offer to find an authenticator app if you don’t have one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VvQbdI"&gt;If you lose your phone, change numbers, or decide to revoke authorization rights, come back to this menu to make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Ywec"&gt;Note that the interface is different if you use PayPal as a business account. From the main “Summary” page, click the gear icon to be taken to the “Settings” page. Under “Login and Security,” look for the “Security Key” option to add your phone number or a security key as your 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eb6xru"&gt;Ring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RwA4Jd"&gt;Like with Nest, make sure your Ring app is up to date. Swipe over from the left, then go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-Step Verification” (you’ll find it under “Account Security”). Tap the big “Turn on two-factor” button. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jxBIA"&gt;From then on, you’ll need both your password and an SMS verification code whenever you want to log in to Ring from a new device. You can also opt to have the codes sent to an email address instead of over SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3wZlHD"&gt;Signal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gifHsA"&gt;Rather than traditional 2FA, Signal uses a PIN. Select your profile icon on the upper-left side to reach the “Settings” menu, and then select “Account.” If you toggle on “Registration Lock,” each time you re-register your phone number, you’ll need to enter your PIN (which you were asked for when you originally registered). Signal requires your PIN to be at least four digits long, up to a maximum of 20 digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qH37IU"&gt;When you first enable Registration Lock, Signal will ask you to type in your PIN for the first six and 12 hours after being enabled. The company says this is designed to help you to remember it through random repetition. So after the first day, it will ask you to enter it in the next day, then in three days, after a full week, and finally one last time after 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUwwu"&gt;If you happen to forget your PIN and can’t log in to Signal, you will have to wait for seven days of inactivity for your registration lock to expire, after which you can log in to your app again to set up a new PIN. Those already actively using Signal won’t have to worry about the Registration Lock resetting, as that clock starts only when the app isn’t open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OslvMC"&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wqXOXa"&gt;To enable 2FA, you’ll first need to find the “Account Settings” page. There are two ways to access this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OMqM43"&gt;Click on your username or profile picture in the Slack app to open a drop-down menu, and then select “View profile.” Your account information will now display on the right side of the chat window. Under your avatar, next to the “Edit Profile” button, click the three-dot icon for additional actions, and select “Account settings.” You can also head straight to &lt;a href="http://my.slack.com/account/settings"&gt;my.slack.com/account/settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SuDMWN"&gt;You should immediately see the selection for “Two-Factor Authentication.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lvEr4D"&gt;If you do not see the option for 2FA, check whether your Slack account is for work. Some employers may use single sign-on services that bypass the need for 2FA, which would remove this option from Slack’s Account Settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkPknlWqR0oYvH3aW9DkZZClRSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8674071/slack_2fa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95lwat"&gt;If this is a personal Slack, however, then select “Expand” on “Two-Factor Authentication” and hit the “Set Up Two-Factor Authentication” button to verify your information via an SMS or authenticator app. If you have multiple email addresses, you may need to select a default one before you can decide on your preferred 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyIyx7"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls9eeF"&gt;From the app’s main camera screen, tap your profile icon and find the gear icon to access your settings. Select “Two-Factor Authentication” and choose whether to receive a text message verification or hook it up to your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U18RpL"&gt;Once 2FA has been enabled on your Snapchat account, you can add trusted devices, plus request a recovery code for when you’re planning to be somewhere without cellular service. Snapchat does not seem to currently support security-key logins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VixNS6"&gt;TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lQIy8o"&gt;To set up 2FA on TikTok (in this case, we’re assuming a mobile device), tap your profile icon on the lower right, then the three dots in the upper right of the screen. Go to “Security and login” and you’ll see “2-step verification.” TikTok offers to send a verification code via a text message or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="riVNpw"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFo0DY"&gt;On the Twitter mobile app, tap the three-line “hamburger” icon at the top left of the screen and select “Settings and privacy.” Go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Security.” Tap “Two-factor authentication” and follow the directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaAdva"&gt;On the web, click on “More” in the left-hand menu and find “Settings and privacy.” Click on “Security and account access” (or you can just follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/security_and_account_access"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;). Select “Security” &amp;gt; “Two-factor authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjA6YE"&gt;Once you’re all set up, Twitter will give you the option to verify through an authenticator app or via a text message with a code sent to your phone. Twitter has also added security-key support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter lets you use a text message, an app, or a security key for authentication." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xO3a1YjV128HBni2tNODpVkCoE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931118/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.18.14_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter lets you use a text message, an app, or a security key for authentication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvcRkp"&gt;As with other services mentioned above, you can generate a backup code to use when you’re traveling and will be without internet or cell service. You may also see an option to create a temporary app password that you can use to log in from other devices. This can be used to log in to third-party apps if you have them linked to your Twitter account. Note that the temporary password expires one hour after being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pGQRc0"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGdipv"&gt;Open WhatsApp and find the “Settings” menu under the upper-right dots icon. Look under “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-step verification” &amp;gt; “Enable.” The app will ask you to enter a six-digit PIN to use as verification. You can optionally add an email address in case you forget your PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHDrKE"&gt;Having an email associated with your WhatsApp account is important since the service won’t let you reverify yourself if you’ve used WhatsApp within the last seven days and have forgotten your PIN. So if you can’t wait a week to reverify, it’s helpful to have entered an email address so you can log yourself in or disable 2FA. In the same vein: be cautious of emails encouraging you to turn off 2FA if you didn’t request it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u4ZojK"&gt;Did we miss your favorite apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wxgHe3"&gt;For more information, check out the &lt;a href="https://2fa.directory/"&gt;2FA Directory&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes and lists companies that support 2FA, and gives you the option to message a company on Twitter, Facebook, or email to request that 2FA be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4X9gF"&gt;A final note: while adding 2FA is great for an extra layer of security on all your accounts, remember that you should be changing and updating your passwords regularly even with 2FA enabled, just to stay in tip-top shape. If that’s not your style, you can also use a password manager to automatically take care of it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y34DWy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 1st, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 19th, 2017, and has been checked and updated several times so that the instructions for adding 2FA to these apps remain current. This is the latest update. Instructions for Fitbit and TikTok have also been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With iCloud Plus, Apple’s privacy promise is paired with an upsell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jNNneQHsZgLw96texISzkDykoEs=/321x158:2040x1304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432729/appleprivacy_vsavov2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some privacy may be paywalled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DAnKrI"&gt;Apple has spent considerable time championing itself as a protector of user privacy. Its CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that privacy is “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;,” the company has based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420108/apple-new-over-sharing-ad-privacy-security-iphone"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; around its privacy promises, and it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;high profile battles&lt;/a&gt; with authorities to keep its users’ devices private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub0zXv"&gt;The pitch is simple: our products protect your privacy. But this promise has shifted very subtly in the wake of this week’s iCloud Plus announcement, which for the first time bundled new security protections into a paid subscription service. The pitch is still “our products keep you safe,” but now one of those “products” is a monthly subscription that doesn’t come with the device in your box — even if those devices are getting more built-in protections as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48bdJE"&gt;iCloud has always been one of Apple’s simplest services. You get 5GB of free storage to backup &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428"&gt;everything from images, to messages and app data&lt;/a&gt;, and you pay a monthly subscription if you want more (or just want to silence &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540"&gt;Apple’s ransom note&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17168618/apple-more-free-icloud-space-200gb"&gt;inevitably run out of storage&lt;/a&gt;). Apple isn’t changing anything about the pricing or storage options as part of the shift to iCloud Plus. Prices will still range from $0.99 a month for 50GB of storage up to $9.99 for 2TB. But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; changing is the list of features you’re getting, which is expanding by three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aUsX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Private Relay and Hide my Email are privacy features included with iCloud Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZYZl"&gt;The first change sits more within iCloud’s traditional cloud storage remit, and is an expansion of Apple’s existing HomeKit Secure Video offering. iCloud Plus now lets you securely stream and record from an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/#:~:text=%20and%202tb%20with%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20homekit%20secure%20video%20cameras%20(%249.99%20per%20month)"&gt;unlimited number of cameras&lt;/a&gt;, up from a previous &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7bc5df9d9/ios#:~:text=up%20to%20five%20cameras"&gt;maximum of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGfrOg"&gt;With the new Private Relay and Hide My Mail features, however, iCloud Plus is expanding its remit from a storage-based service into a storage and privacy service. The privacy-focused additions are minor in the grand scheme of the protections Apple offers across its ecosystem, and Apple isn’t using them as justification for increasing the cost of iCloud. But they nevertheless open the door to so-called “premium” privacy features becoming a part of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;large and growing services empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwdyUq"&gt;The features appear as an admission from Apple about the limits of what privacy protections can do on-device. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;” was how the company put its promise in a 2019 ad, but when your iPhone needs to connect to the internet to browse the web, receive email, and generally earn the “i” in “iPhone,” inevitably some of its privacy rests on the infrastructure serving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPFpAY"&gt;The most interesting of these new features is Apple’s Private Relay, which aims to shield your web traffic from prying eyes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. It hides your data from both internet service providers as well as advertisers that might build a detailed profile on you based on your browsing history. While it sounds a bit like a VPN, Apple claims the Private Relay’s dual-hop design means even Apple itself doesn’t have a complete picture of your browsing data. Regular VPNs, meanwhile, require a level of trust that means you &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/"&gt;need to be careful&lt;/a&gt; about which VPN you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeG-p67DnKMzS4Km-DT-vaYOwNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649047/icloud_private_relay_diagram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJD1oh"&gt;As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explains, VPNs can protect your data from outsiders, but they “involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pAcd"&gt;“We wanted to take that completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPQkKW"&gt;Here’s how it works. When using Private Relay your internet traffic is being sent via two proxy servers on its way to its destination. First, your traffic gets encrypted before it leaves your device. Then, once it hits the initial, Apple-operated server, it gets assigned an anonymous IP that hides your specific location. Next up, the second server, which is controlled by a third-party, decrypts the web address and forwards the traffic to its destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDWvR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple thinks today’s VPNs pose “a really difficult trust decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFmCY"&gt;Apple can’t see which website you’re requesting, only the IP address you’re requesting it from, and third-parties can’t see that IP address, only the website you’re requesting. (Apple says it also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163871/cloudflare-apple-dns-protocol-online-privacy"&gt;Oblivious DNS over HTTPS.&lt;/a&gt;) That’s different from most “double VPN” and “multi-hop” VPN services you can subscribe to today, where a provider may control both servers. You could perhaps combine a VPN and a proxy server to do something similar, though. Apple says Private Relay won’t impact performance, which can be a concern with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzT2am"&gt;While Private Relay is theoretically more private than a regular VPN, Apple’s offering is also more limited. You can’t use it to trick websites into thinking you’re accessing them from a different location, so you’re not going to be able to use Private Relay to get around geographical limitations on content blocked by a government or a service like Netflix. And it only seems to cover web browsing data through Safari, not third-party browsers or native apps. In a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/"&gt;WWDC developer session&lt;/a&gt; about the feature, Apple says that Private Relay will also include DNS queries and a “small subset of traffic from apps,” specifically insecure HTTP traffic. But there was no mention of other browsers, and Apple clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s only handling app traffic when your app technically happens to be loading the web inside a browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dtq6yXo9hGGm4aRcOWg0hXgVLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649697/Apple_iPhone12Pro_mail_new_message_hide_my_email_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hide my Email provides a slick interface for making burner email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68gn2K"&gt;In addition to Private Relay, iCloud Plus also includes Hide my Email, a feature designed to protect the privacy of your email address. Instead of needing to use your real email address for every site that requests it (increasing the risk of an important part of your login credentials becoming public, not to mention getting inundated with spam), Hide My Email lets you generate and share unique random addresses which will then forward any messages they receive back to your true email address. It’s another privacy-focused feature that sits outside of iCloud’s traditional area of focus, and could be useful even if similar options have been available for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umJUM7"&gt;Gmail, for example, lets you use a simple “+” symbol to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt; add random extra characters to your email address&lt;/a&gt;. Even Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650885/apple-sign-in-sso-tool-data-collection-privacy-ios-13-wwdc-2019"&gt;“Sign In with Apple” service&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar trick, handing out random email addresses to each service you use it with. But the advantage of Apple’s new service is that it gives you an easily-accessible shortcut to generate them right in its Mail app and Safari, putting the feature front and center in a way that seems likely to boost its mainstream appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OktZBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of privacy still included with standard purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wE7vYu"&gt;Apple might be charging for Private Relay and Hide My Email by bundling them into iCloud subscriptions, but these iCloud Plus additions are still dwarfed by the array of privacy protections already built into Apple’s hardware and software. There’s no sign that any of these existing privacy features will be locked behind a monthly subscription fee anytime soon. Indeed, the list of built-in protections Apple offers continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnlgS"&gt;This includes a new Mail Privacy Protection feature in the Mail app in iOS 15, which sends your emails through a relay service to confuse any tracking pixels that might be hiding in them (read more about tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681508/tracking-pixel-email-spying-superhuman-web-beacon-open-tracking-read-receipts-location"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There’s also a new App Privacy Report feature coming to iOS 15 that will show how often apps are accessing your location, camera, microphone, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHcRXNO6nTE0sIh-lo-fiCFma6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649702/Apple_iPhone12Pro_settings_privacy_app_privacy_report_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhones’ list of built-in privacy features continues to expand with iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZojtJ"&gt;But with iCloud Plus, Apple now offers two privacy protections that are distinct from those that are included for free with the purchase of a device, and the division between the two seems arbitrary to some extent. Apple justifies charging for features like Private Relay and Hide My Email because of the incremental costs of running those services, but Mail Privacy Protection also relies on a relay server, which presumably isn’t free to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t46jic"&gt;Regardless of its rationale, choosing to charge for these services means that Apple has opened the door to premium privacy features becoming part of its increasingly important services business, beyond just its hardware business. Adherence to privacy was already part of the company’s attempt to lock you into its devices; now it could become part of the attempt to lock you into its services. All the while, those &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;walls around Apple’s garden&lt;/a&gt; creep higher and higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIhUI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uf8Rp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJDmFx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaoj9p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLU8A2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagAh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is fighting back against exploitative, slanderous websites </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bmqF-U2AA2R_J4WnIGQRHtxPQi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432668/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hO6nq"&gt;Google is updating its search algorithms to prevent sites from filling search results with unproven slanderous claims about individuals, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/technology/google-algorithm-known-victims.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The changes follow a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/technology/change-my-google-results.html"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/24/technology/online-slander-websites.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, which found a vast web of sites hosting unverified and potentially life-ruining claims about individuals, alongside an industry of other services promising to remove the offending content from search results for substantial fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymokns"&gt;The search giant is making a series of changes to its rankings to combat the sites, which Google’s vice president for global policy and standards and trust and safety David Graff said should eventually have a “significant and positive impact” for those affected. Now, when users report they’ve been a victim of these sites by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en"&gt;using its pre-existing process&lt;/a&gt;, Google will register that person as a “known victim,” and will automatically “suppress” similar results for that person’s name, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZU5Chj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following investigations from New York Times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdEAGK"&gt;It’s an important shift considering how these sites operate, where posts are routinely taken from one site and republished across over a dozen more. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; even &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/24/technology/online-slander-websites.html"&gt;conducted an experiment&lt;/a&gt; where it created one such post about its own reporter, only to see an initial crop of five posts spawn 21 more across a network of 15 sites. Google’s changes could help to stop these numerous posts from clogging up search results. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reported that completely taking down the posts would have cost it around $20,000. Individual sites and services reportedly charged upwards of $700 to get each post removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qq2ob2"&gt;Some of the changes have reportedly already come into effect, with more coming in the months ahead, but the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that its own tests have highlighted initial problems with the approach. Although it says posts had “mostly” disappeared for some users, it notes that Google’s changes didn’t appear to have caught a new slander site, which may not have received the volume of complaints to put it on Google’s radar yet. However, for others, the new process appeared to work better, with posts disappearing from the first page of text and image results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oozkm1"&gt;The move represents the latest shift away from Google’s original self-proclaimed role as an impartial provider of results. Back in 2004 the company said its results were “generated completely objectively and are independent of the beliefs and preferences of those who work at Google.” But over the years this position has softened, particularly in light of legislation like the EU’s “right to be forgotten.” It means the company is fulfilling an increasingly important role on the web, even beyond the 90 percent of global searches it currently handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmfT9G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $2,700 robot dog will carry a single bottle of water for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avhb-fId9rmtzvyKitYMqk7qYuM=/0x14:1244x843/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432488/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_11.00.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tvP5un"&gt;Boston Dynamics isn’t the only company that makes futuristic quadrupedal robots. Chinese firm Unitree Robotics has also been at it for years, and this week revealed its latest creation: the &lt;a href="https://www.unitree.com/products/go1/"&gt;Unitree Go1&lt;/a&gt;, a robust-looking four-legged bot that’s remarkably cheap, with prices starting at just $2,700. (For comparison, Boston Dynamics’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;Spot robot costs $74,500&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVODRe"&gt;What is the Go1 &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, though? Well, a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/xdfmhWQyp_8"&gt;demo video&lt;/a&gt; shows it being put to such useful tasks as “following someone on a run” and “carrying a single bottle of water.” Sure it’s not practical to have a robot butler for your phone and wallet, but it makes a statement on a night out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxw5Ns"&gt;More realistically, the robotics industry is still exploring the best applications for these sorts of machines. Spot, for example, is currently being tested in areas like &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wND9goxDVrY"&gt;industrial inspections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;police reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144648/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-mass-state-police-trial-issues"&gt;mixed results&lt;/a&gt;). Unitree, though, says it wants to make quadrupedal robots as affordable and popular as &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/this-robotics-startup-wants-to-be-the-boston-dynamics-of-china"&gt;smartphones and drones&lt;/a&gt;. So, a fun demo reel that shows the Go1 just sort of chilling out and looking cool makes perfect sense. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b08yZBxXYP7xb3zL-uxyC_iwXLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649746/unitree_go1_small_short_video.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Unitree Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incidentally, “hang out without effort” is one of my top desires post-lockdown. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gHMLs0"&gt;The company only has a &lt;a href="https://www.unitree.com/products/go1/"&gt;basic spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the robot on its site, but here’s what we do know. The Go1 comes in three versions: the $2,700 Go1 Air, $3,500 Go1, and $8,500 Go1 Edu. Each weighs about 12kg (26 pounds) and the more expensive models come with more processor power and sensors (the Go1 Edu is the only version with an unspecified programming API). It seems automatic person-following and obstacle-avoidance come standard, though only the pricier models hit the advertised top speed of 17km/h. Unitree doesn’t say anything about battery life, either. Though given that Spot only has enough juice for 90 minutes of operation, we’d say that the “all-day companion” mode suggested by the Go1 demo video is a bit of an artful exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3E2fuP"&gt;At any rate, tech like this shows that quadrupedal robots are quickly turning from novelties to commodities. The real question is: can they also be useful, or will they just be carrying our water for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 4 has been lovingly recreated as an iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21dUaMHpSIshryxekdjf3IuKc64=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432350/VLS_4381_1_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OldOS app on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDMtyW"&gt;iOS 4 originally appeared nearly 10 years ago as Apple’s first mobile operating system to drop the iPhone OS naming convention. An 18-year-old developer has now lovingly recreated iOS 4 as an iPhone app, and it’s a beautiful blast from the past. If you never got the chance to use iOS 4, or you’re a fan of the iPhone 3G, OldOS almost flawlessly pulls off the experience of using an iPhone from a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aF5lrw"&gt;OldOS is “designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible,” says Zane, the developer behind the app. It’s all built using Apple’s SwiftUI, so it includes buttery smooth animations and even the old iPhone home button that vibrates with haptic feedback to make it feel like a real button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TJOAq"&gt;Apple’s built-in iOS 4 apps have also been recreated here, and it’s a real flashback to the skeuomorphic days of the iPhone whenever they launch. Photos lets you view your existing camera roll as you would have 10 years ago, while Notes transports you back to the yellow post-it notes of yesteryear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXRH7j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Launch Day  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing OldOS — iOS 4 beautifully rebuilt in SwiftUI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*   Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.&lt;br&gt;*  Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.&lt;br&gt;*  ️ Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on. &lt;a href="https://t.co/K0JOE2fEKM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K0JOE2fEKM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zane (@zzanehip) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zzanehip/status/1402625414762270723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0N5hY"&gt;The only apps that don’t work as you might expect are Messages and YouTube. Apple used to bundle YouTube directly into its operating system, and the developer behind OldOS says there are “still some major issues with YouTube” and Messages that they’re working to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuHOBz"&gt;Everything else is mostly flawless. and you can even browse the web in the old UI of Safari. The App Store also list apps that will redirect you to the modern store to download and install. There are some things that simply don’t work, including folders and no jiggling to rearrange home screen apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dw0gz"&gt;We’ve seen this type of nostalgic app appear on the iPhone before. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010953/apple-iphone-ipod-app-rewound-app-store-features-music-player-apple-music"&gt;Rewound launched in the App Store&lt;/a&gt; back in December 2019, turning an iPhone into an iPod. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024729/apple-rewound-app-iphone-ipod-click-wheel-web-android-not-available"&gt;Apple quickly pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; a few days later, citing store violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmWMWl"&gt;This latest &lt;a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/67C9v9VB"&gt;OldOS app is available on Apple’s TestFlight&lt;/a&gt; service, which is typically used to distribute beta versions of apps. That means it probably won’t last long before Apple takes exception, so grab it while you can. Zane has also published the source code for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project"&gt;entire project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re willing to compile it in Xcode then it will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung pushes pixel size even further with new camera sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vySmsQbNA_U2A2teUKK3ia92SYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432122/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gnuK0M"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005959/en/Samsung-Breaks-New-Ground-with-Mass-Production-of-Industry%E2%80%99s-Smallest-0.64%CE%BCm-pixel-Mobile-Image-Sensor/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new image sensor for smartphone cameras that it says has the smallest pixels in the industry. The ISOCELL JN1 is a 50-megapixel sensor with a relatively tiny 1/2.76-inch format, meaning its pixels are just 0.64μm in size. For comparison, Samsung already broke records in 2019 with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/23/20881141/samsung-isocell-slim-gh1-sensor-smallest-pixels"&gt;slightly larger ISOCELL Slim GH1&lt;/a&gt;, another 50-megapixel sensor with 0.7μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfAXUh"&gt;Conventional camera wisdom says that smaller pixels usually result in worse image quality with higher noise, so why is Samsung doing this? According to the company, it’s about form factor versatility. The sensor’s smaller size means it can be used in ultrawide or telephoto camera modules — which are challenging to design when size is at a premium — or as a way to reduce the height of the primary camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJukvb"&gt;As with other high-resolution camera sensors, the JN1 will make use of pixel-binning technology that combines multiple pixels into one for higher light sensitivity. In this case, Samsung says the sensor will capture 12.5-megapixel photos with the equivalent of 1.28μm pixels, and the company is also claiming a 16 percent boost to light sensitivity with its ISOCELL 2.0 tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCaixq"&gt;Unusually, Samsung even held a full-on live-streamed launch event for this sensor, which you can watch here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gisJ1C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aai2Ux2Wsnk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SI2Dcz"&gt;Samsung says the JN1 is currently in mass production, so it’s likely to show up in smartphones before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNgiei"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces the $9,000 professional drone it teased at CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZZk2-NCnZzRdGUGHnd8eFg33QY=/93x0:1041x632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69431382/bandicam_2021_01_11_17_16_20_990.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EpBg0p"&gt;Sony is now &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/airpeak"&gt;fully revealing its Airpeak S1 drone&lt;/a&gt;, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225758/sony-airpeak-drone-alpha-photography-cameras-ces-2021-announcement"&gt;teased at CES 2021 in January&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement contains a lot more detail on the &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/airpeak/p/arss1"&gt;drone’s capabilities, features&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals a $9,000 pricetag for the drone sans gimbal or camera, all of which cements the idea that this drone will be aimed squarely at the professional video market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nhMvLMF8hp3_zdH74RRZUC3Ucpc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649108/Airpeak_ILCE_7SM3_SEL24F14GM_right_under.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Airpeak with an A7S and 24mm lens attached to the sold-separately gimbal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lC4U3o"&gt;The Airpeak S1 is built to work with Sony’s mirrorless cameras, including the A7S Mark III, FX3, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250448/sony-alpha-1-camera-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;8K-capable Alpha 1&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll be attached to a special version of the Gremsy T3 gimbal that’s been designed specifically for the Airpeak and that you’ll have to buy separately. With a camera, the drone will have around 12 minutes of flight time (though it can achieve 22 minutes without any load). It’s also worth noting that the camera needs its own batteries — it isn’t being provided power by the drone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwHxRZ"&gt;Sony’s already released a preview of the types of shots you can pull off with the drone, which you can see below. You can also get a shot of the retracting landing gear in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLQfn3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKIK4CIQk3g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kRxVWe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_XWbHuwsfw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Smg8ka"&gt;One of the drone’s biggest selling points is its stability and wind-resistance. According to Sony, it can stay stable in winds of up to 44.7 miles per hour (that’s 20m/s, double what &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Finspire-2%2Finfo%23specs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526921%2Fsony-airpeak-s1-drone-cinema-video-acceleration-flight-time" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI quotes for the Inspire 2&lt;/a&gt;), and it has five sets of stereo cameras that let the drone and an infrared rangefinder that should help the drone stop before it hits obstacles and stay steady even without satellite reception. Sony even enlisted JAXA, the Japanese space agency, to help it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nRI6iVOeiE"&gt;do some of the tests for the drone&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xH7pQ3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nRI6iVOeiE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgMIsA"&gt;The Airpeak is also quick — it can do 0-50 (which is close to its top speed of 55.9 miles per hour) in 3.5 seconds. It is worth noting, though, that’s without any sort of attachments — Sony hasn’t said what kind of speed or acceleration can be achieved when the drone is flying a camera. That said, Sony showed me and other journalists a video of the drone doing figure-eights in the air, which it pulled off with impressive speed and agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3sKYi"&gt;For comparison, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fmatrice600-pro%2Finfo%23specs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526921%2Fsony-airpeak-s1-drone-cinema-video-acceleration-flight-time" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI’s Matrice 600 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which costs around $7,000 without a gimbal or camera, has a top speed of 40 miles per hour and a quoted battery life of 32 minutes alone or 16 minutes with a 13-pound payload, using its stock batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hKRq2i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony expects to ship the Airpeak in the fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5Fuak"&gt;The Airpeak S1 can be operated with just the included controller, but Sony has an app called Airpeak Flight to help make things easier. The app is iOS/iPadOS-only for now, but it will allow for control of the camera and gimbal. The Airpeak can be operated by a single person, but also allows for dual-operator mode, where one person controls flight and the other controls the camera. Sony says the controller’s range is still being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kxl6GQpCM49Ot66RTiWdQacd5MM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649043/Airpeak_controller_KV_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controller with an iPad running Airpeak Flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c2xhdh"&gt;While you won’t get a camera or gimbal for the Airpeak S1’s $9,000 price, it does come with two pairs of propellers, the controller, two batteries, and a charger. Sony expects to ship it in the fall, and will be offering a service plan to cover damage that could occur from crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Kl98e"&gt;In light of all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463946/dji-drone-ban-pentagon-department-of-interior"&gt;legislation and controversy around drones from China&lt;/a&gt;, Sony is making it clear that the Airpeak S1 is designed and made in Japan; it came up repeatedly in a press briefing and again in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bitcoin will soon be an official currency in El Salvador</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpWI6COaVuAjGZqTwmK-EIESaEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69431111/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5bAId"&gt;El Salvador has passed a resolution to make Bitcoin a legal currency, which makes it the first country to do so (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/09/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-congress"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the law, citizens will be able to use Bitcoin to do everything from paying taxes and paying off debts to buying goods and services. The move was championed by President Nayib Bukele, who says it’s a way to help those who don’t have access to banks, and those who want to send money back to the country from abroad, but critics worry that it’ll be more show than substantive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3R6wx"&gt;The proposal was passed by El Salvador’s congress on Tuesday night, after Bukele &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/05/el-salvador-becomes-the-first-country-to-adopt-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-.html"&gt;announced it at a Bitcoin conference in Miami&lt;/a&gt; last week. It wasn’t a close call, with 62 out of 84 legislators voting for it, but it’s worth noting that Bukele has large amounts of political power in the country — his party makes up a majority of the congress, which allowed him to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/20/el-salvadors-president-launched-self-coup-watch-creeping-corruption-authoritarianism/"&gt;take control over much of the government&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UlL5sp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bukele wants citizens to think about Bitcoin, not dollars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AzXGQV"&gt;While Bitcoin will become an official currency for El Salvador in just under three months, it won’t be the only currency — the US dollar, which was previously the country’s only currency, will be sticking around as an option, though &lt;a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvador-passes-the-bitcoin-law-10617.htm"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Cryptonews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bukele said that he wanted the country’s citizens to think about money in terms of Bitcoin, not dollars. The resolution states that citizens should be able to convert between the two currencies at any time, and that US dollars “will be used as the reference currency” for accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDcmIG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, some human rights groups focused on Central America have doubts about Bitcoin’s adoption leading to meaningful change for many of the country’s citizens. One concern is that the nation’s lower class won’t have access to the tech required to use and store Bitcoin. While the law requires anyone offering goods or services to accept Bitcoin, it does &lt;a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvador-passes-the-bitcoin-law-10617.htm"&gt;have an exception&lt;/a&gt; for those who don’t have access to the technology. The law does say that the government will “promote the necessary training and mechanisms” to allow the population to use Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, according to the university’s map, El Salvador’s contributions make up 0.00 percent of the global computing power that’s put towards Bitcoin. Bukele, though, could be looking to change that — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1402680890057166858?s=20"&gt;he’s tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the state-owned electric company has been instructed to provide cheap electricity for mining, powered by volcanoes (no, that’s not a joke).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink is in talks with ‘several’ airlines for in-flight Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A satellite tracker image is seen displayed on a smartphone..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xgOlc95mKruSQCSb0Vsik56Yj5U=/0x40:3000x2040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69430933/1229328429.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mS4vVL"&gt;The team behind SpaceX’s growing satellite internet network Starlink is in talks with “several” airlines to beam internet to their airplanes, the project’s vice president said during a conference panel on Wednesday. Expanding Starlink from rural homes and onto airlines is an expected move for Elon Musk’s space company as it races to open the broadband network commercially later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsmHBp"&gt;“We’re in talks with several of the airlines,” Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX’s VP of Starlink and commercial sales, told a panel at the Connected Aviation Intelligence Summit on Wednesday. “We have our own aviation product in development… we’ve already done some demonstrations to date, and looking to get that product finalized to be put on aircraft in the very near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9hPQIz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aircraft antennas will be like the consumer ones, “with obvious enhancements for aviation connectivity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhajbv"&gt;Since 2018, SpaceX has launched nearly 1,800 Starlink satellites out of the roughly 4,400 it needs to provide global coverage of broadband internet, primarily for rural homes where fiber connections aren’t available. The company is in the midst of a Starlink beta phase that promises up to 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds, with tens of thousands of users so far. Most are paying $99 per month for internet under that beta, using a $499 bundle of a self-aligning Starlink dish and Wi-Fi router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXWFp4"&gt;Last year, SpaceX filed plans to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/spacex-asks-to-test-starlink-satellite-internet-with-a-gulfstream-jet.html"&gt;test Starlink on five Gulfstream jets&lt;/a&gt;. And in March, SpaceX sought FCC approval to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319761/spacex-starlink-fcc-internet-cars-boats-aircraft"&gt;use Starlink with so-called Earth Stations in Motion&lt;/a&gt; — industry jargon to refer to basically any vehicle that would receive a signal, including cars, trucks, maritime vessels, and aircraft. Musk clarified on Twitter at the time: “Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp;amp; RVs.” Another FCC filing from last Friday requested approval for testing across five US states of an updated receiver with a square-shaped antenna, a basic design commonly associated with aircraft antennae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lrSNz"&gt;Hofeller said the design for SpaceX’s airline antennas will be very similar to the technology inside its consumer terminals, but “with obvious enhancements for aviation connectivity.” Like those consumer antennas, the aviation hardware will be designed and built by SpaceX, he said. The airborne antennas could link with ground stations to communicate with Starlink satellites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2EJA2T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Satellites with lasers to work with flights far over oceans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOf5aW"&gt;For Starlink to provide connectivity to airplanes flying over remote parts of the ocean, far from ground stations, will require inter-satellite links — a capability in which satellites talk to each other using laser links without first bouncing signals off ground stations. “The next generation of our constellation, which is in work, will have this inter-satellite connectivity,” Hofeller said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="raneDo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;Competition is fierce&lt;/a&gt; between Musk’s Starlink network and the growing industry of low-orbit satellite internet providers. New competitors include so-called mega-constellations from Jeff Bezos’ Amazon, which has yet to launch any of its planned 3,000 satellites, and the UK’s OneWeb, which has launched 182 satellites of roughly 640 planned. All of those satellites will be in low-Earth orbit, a domain below the more distant geostationary orbits of larger internet satellites that currently provide internet services to commercial aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8cr8V3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Passengers and customers want a great experience that [geostationary] systems simply cannot provide”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4z5BGD"&gt;Established US competitors for in-flight internet are Intelsat and ViaSat, which operate networks of satellites in geostationary orbit. ViaSat &lt;a href="https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/delta-selects-viasats-flight-connectivity-revolutionize-customer/"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to use its next-generation satellite network on Delta’s mainline fleet. The California-based company is planning a 300-satellite low-orbit network of its own as well as a new geostationary trio that will start launching early next year. It is already a diehard competitor to SpaceX. ViaSat has threatened to sue the Federal Communications Commission for not doing an environmental review on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405779/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-lower-orbits-against-amazon-rival-objections"&gt;recent Starlink modification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2UJe2"&gt;SpaceX appears confident that it can outlast the more established competition. “All in all, passengers and customers want a great experience that [geostationary] systems simply cannot provide,” Hofeller said on the panel. “So it’s going to be up to the individual airline whether they want to be responsive to that, or if they’re okay with having a system that is not as responsive to their customers’ demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJHnTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Timeline TBD&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwsbWH"&gt;OneWeb, which was pulled out of bankruptcy last year by the UK government and Indian telecom giant Bharti Global, is also targeting in-flight internet services with its constellation and has been &lt;a href="https://www.satellitetoday.com/mobility/2021/03/19/oneweb-selects-satixfy-to-build-leo-geo-in-flight-connectivity-terminal/"&gt;far more public&lt;/a&gt; with its plans than SpaceX. Asked by the panel moderator when customers can expect to use in-flight internet with any of the competing satellite networks currently expanding in low-Earth orbit, OneWeb’s VP of mobility services Ben Griffin estimated “the middle part of next year… maybe sooner.” Airlines want to see developed hardware and services that work first, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUltO9"&gt;“We have been talking to airlines for quite some time, so there’s no lack of interest,” Griffin said during the same panel. SpaceX’s Hofeller was cagey when the question turned to him — “What Ben said is correct. People want to see the hardware, they wanna see the constellation, and so we’re driving that hard as fast as we can. When the announcement will be? To be determined. Don’t know. Hopefully sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qw8Yv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to the Keystone XL pipeline, for real this time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biden Blocking Keystone Threatens To End Mega Pipelines Era" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PCPC_DnJyTctBN_5qAo-qAyrE8Q=/0x32:4607x3103/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69430795/1230819697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Crews work on a right of way for the Keystone XL pipeline near Oyen, Alberta, Canada, on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021. U.S. President Joe Biden revoked the permit for TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL energy pipeline via executive order hours after his inauguration, the clearest sign yet that constructing a major new pipeline in the U.S. has become an impossible task. | Jason Franson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jHNrnw"&gt;It’s official: the Keystone XL is going away for good. The pipeline’s developer &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-06-09-tc-energy-confirms-termination-of-keystone-xl-pipeline-project/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that it’s terminating the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BYOfC"&gt;For years, the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations have gone back and forth on allowing the massive transcontinental project to move forward. On his first day in office, Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240466/joe-biden-keystone-xl-pipeline-canceled-executive-order-climate-change"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; the Presidential Permit that his predecessor had granted. Apparently, that was the nail in Keystone XL’s coffin. Soon after, TC Energy suspended work on the project to &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-01-20-tc-energy-disappointed-with-expected-executive-action-revoking-keystone-xl-presidential-permit/"&gt;“consider its options,”&lt;/a&gt; but hadn’t fully given up on the pipeline until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rpxB"&gt;“We took on a multi-billion dollar corporation and we won!” Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer for the nonprofit Indigenous Environmental Network &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dallasgoldtooth/status/1402730374682320898"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “The People made this happen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yk4NZU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The People made this happen!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41Vzrr"&gt;Native American tribes and activists fought the project for more than ten years. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation &lt;a href="https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration after it granted the Keystone XL a permit to continue construction. The pipeline threatened their lands and water sources, and the Trump administration didn’t properly consult with the tribes, they said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6krWo"&gt;The $8 billion pipeline would have pumped 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta, Canada’s tar sands to Nebraska, where it would connect with other pipelines that reach the Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxO8vQ"&gt;Prior to TC Energy’s announcement today, a lot of construction on the pipeline had already taken place in Canada. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-keystone/tc-energy-cuts-jobs-as-keystone-pipeline-nixed-but-markets-start-to-move-on-idUSKBN29Q1T8"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of workers since suspending work on the project this year. But neither President Obama nor Biden worried much about taking away American jobs by killing the pipeline. It only would have resulted in 35 full-time permanent jobs in the US once construction was done, according to a State Department &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Record-of-Decision-and-National-Interest-Determination.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Climate change, made worse by new oil and gas projects, was a bigger threat to American livelihoods, both administrations argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ek2kas"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pipeline opponents are far from kicking back and relaxing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ugxSo"&gt;Despite the victory against Keystone XL, pipeline opponents are far from kicking back and relaxing. Protests escalated this week against Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline, which also runs from Alberta to the midwest of the US. Enbridge wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356423/oil-gas-pipelines-abandoned-enbridge-line-3"&gt;abandon the existing pipeline and replace it&lt;/a&gt; with a new one that can carry twice as much crude oil. At least 100 hundred people were arrested during demonstrations this week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/climate/line-3-pipeline-protest-native-americans.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=132390695&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--k05Jk303667-goxaNNuqqLCl3uyzu9enH0Y97YfDZURCOo-bMud78yeHzeQ1PNhtkAI_QTtx4w9F7L0hzZ2jEz8ch1MJkoS4eSitm5LHOekJkutg&amp;amp;utm_content=132390695&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5RBa1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
