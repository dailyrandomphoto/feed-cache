    <title>Microsoft will let you control an Xbox with a TV remote soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwm5KKf80Hjzi5adj68USg-5o7w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833242/vpavic_4275_20201030_0033.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yHkI7b"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test the ability for TV remotes to navigate around the Xbox dashboard. A new version of the Xbox dashboard for Xbox Series S / X consoles is being tested with selected Xbox Insiders, and it enables new HDMI-CEC features that let ordinary TV remote controls navigate around the Xbox dashboard and control streaming apps like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ7uaf"&gt;While the Xbox Series S / X consoles have had some HDMI-CEC features to control TV volume or turn on TVs when an Xbox boots up, these new additions mean you won’t have to reach for an Xbox controller if you just want to watch content from Netflix, Twitch, YouTube, or many other streaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FdN1UL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;these are the new Xbox controls in the dashboard &lt;a href="https://t.co/eY7HG8713i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eY7HG8713i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1435734530078429189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WArVjk"&gt;The new HDMI-CEC features also include an option to enable your TV to switch input to your Xbox simply by pressing the Xbox button on a controller. You may already have a TV remote that can control your Xbox using infrared commands, but the addition of HDMI-CEC control should make input switching more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leri4u"&gt;The new options can be found in the HDMI-CEC settings part of the Xbox dashboard, and are currently available to testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Xbox Insider rings. We’d expect these new features to rollout to all Xbox Series S / X consoles in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8eBwS"&gt;Microsoft is also currently testing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;new version of the Edge browser&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613617/microsoft-xbox-night-mode-feature-dim-screen-controller-led"&gt;Xbox night mode feature&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627478/microsoft-xbox-series-x-4k-dashboard-update-features"&gt;higher resolution dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, and improved firmware and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663039/microsoft-xbox-controller-firmware-dynamic-latency-input-dli-bluetooth-low-energy"&gt;features for older Xbox One controllers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Ray-Ban’s smart glasses leak before launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIcedLbTPnsi0favZG2LsSDrscI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833151/stories.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWZ1nQ"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban are set to announce their smart glasses collaboration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661109/facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-smart-glasses-teaser"&gt;later today&lt;/a&gt;, September 9th, and right on cue Evan “Evleaks” Blass has &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/evleaks/status/1435831766418341891"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a ton of alleged photos of the product lineup. The glasses are called Ray-Ban Stories, and other than the box it doesn’t look like Facebook branding appears anywhere on the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjaR20"&gt;Evleaks’ images include three distinct frame styles — Wayfarer, Round, and Meteor — and they all look pretty close to the classic Ray-Ban designs. The difference, of course, is the presence of two cameras by the hinges on either side. There’s also a button along the top of the right temple, which could potentially be used to operate the cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jWVMsf4XUXY9ZkgNMTeTrQEHfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836362/E_0Yb_oXoAAAZqc.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ego693"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599599/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-next-product-launch-specs"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the glasses that they “have [Ray-Ban’s] iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.” They don’t have screens for AR functionality, however, so we’re still in the dark about what those things might be. Zuckerberg said that the product is part of the company’s “journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future,” and more advanced AR glasses are also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPBEI"&gt;For now, these pictures don’t do much to show how or whether Facebook has leapt beyond the capabilities of even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13671164/snapchat-spectacles-glasses-review-camera-sunglasses"&gt;Snap’s early Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; — other than by making glasses that look like regular Ray-Bans, of course. We’ll hopefully have the answer to that question later today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRobot’s newest Roomba uses AI to avoid dog poop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfHKlkczb-UOVij3gGUr0eQLvtA=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832964/Roomba_j7_j7__Object_Detection_Pet_Waste.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dog poop avoiding feature is only available on the new Roomba j7+. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: iRobot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUY6vx"&gt;Using a robot vacuum has always been a bit hazardous for pet owners. Leaving a robovac to do its thing in your absence can be a problem if your less-than-perfectly-trained dog or cat also does &lt;em&gt;its &lt;/em&gt;thing while you’re out. A quick Google of “&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Roomba+dog+poop"&gt;Roomba dog poop&lt;/a&gt;” gives you some idea of what the outcome can be, as unheeding robots with spinning brushes barrel into the mess and proceed to spread it liberally around the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R55cEK"&gt;But now, Roomba-maker iRobot say it’s fixed this scatological problem. The company’s latest robovac, the Roomba j7+, uses built-in machine vision and AI to identify and avoid pet messes of all sorts. “It’s a big deal for us,” iRobot founder and CEO Colin Angle tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’ve been working on it for a long time and we’re &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; that it works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="maeHwn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; that it works”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2Hiq4"&gt;This last point is particularly important. Competing robovacs like the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/roborock-s6-maxv-robot-vacuum"&gt;Roborock S6 MaxV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/robot-vacuum-uses-triple-lidar-avoid-dog-poop/"&gt;360 Smart Life robot vacuum&lt;/a&gt; advertise the same mess-avoiding capabilities, but Angle is skeptical that they’re fully reliable. He says iRobot has been working on the problem for years, even creating a huge database of fake pet mess to train their AI vision systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3TZdw"&gt;“Robotics is supposed to be glamorous, but I don’t know how many Play-Doh models of poo we created,” says Angle. “Many, many thousands.” The result, though, is unwavering confidence in the company’s poop-identifying capabilities. “Our competition are starting to claim that they do this, too, but it’s more like [they do it] at CES with the right lighting,” he says. “We felt the need to really put a line in the sand and say, this is real, it’s not a gimmick. If you have a pet we’re not going to let you down here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R9d8iT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10738679"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="McGx0U"&gt;The fact that avoiding dog mess is the headline feature of iRobot’s latest robot vacuum cleaner gives some suggestion about the problems and progress with these machines. They’ve certainly become more efficient and useful over the years, but there are still some basic teething problems that show up when the rubber hits the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9jTVXG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An upgrade to iRobot’s Genius software offers new cleaning modes and features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdcVxe"&gt;iRobot is hoping to fix some of these with an update to its navigation and control software, known as iRobot Genius. This was initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21377585/irobot-ai-software-update-home-intelligence-genius-app"&gt;launched in August last year&lt;/a&gt; for compatible Roombas, and it not only maps users’ homes to allow for more granular cleaning instructions, but uses built-in machine vision to identify furniture and specific “clean zones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwQzjT"&gt;Version 3.0 of iRobot Genius, which launches today as a free upgrade, adds a number of new features. These include a “Quiet Drive” mode which stops the robot from making a noise when heading to and from cleaning jobs; cleaning time estimates for specific rooms; improved mapping capabilities, including suggested room names based on the robot’s ability to identify items of furniture; and a new “Clean While I’m Away” function. This means, if people like, they can allow iRobot access to their phone location, and whenever they leave the house it will trigger a cleaning session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DGEOzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10738678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jMQQ4s"&gt;The biggest update, though, is only for the new Roomba j7+ which uses a new camera to identify not only dog mess but other hazardous obstacles, like socks, shoes, and headphones. Again, this is done using onboard machine vision, but it does require some action on the part of the owner. If the Roomba finds an unexpected obstacle, it’ll ask via the connected app whether it’s a temporary or permanent fixture. If it’s permanent (like dangling TV cables), then the machine will automatically create a no-clean zone for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbEALR"&gt;As Angle explains, it’s all about making iRobot’s products feel “like a partner” rather than a tool — trusted services that can anticipate owners’ wishes. “The idea is, we know what time it is, we know where we are in the home, and we have an idea of the floor plan in rooms,” he says. “We should start applying respectful rules to our technology and holding our technology to the same types of accountability that we hold each other to in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZfeXc"&gt;It’s also how the company wants to differentiate itself from cheaper competitors. The new Roomba j7+ costs $849 with a base station that holds up to 60 days’ worth of dirt, which is many multiples compared to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/robot-vacuum/s?k=robot+vacuum"&gt;the price tag of basic robovacs&lt;/a&gt;. Angle says iRobot’s free software upgrades, now and in the future, should help persuade customers to choose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY5uzh"&gt;In addition to the features listed above, the new Roomba j7+ also has a new high-end design, a simplified control system (three buttons instead of one), Bluetooth LE capability to simplify onboarding, and a new beveled rim that’s supposed to stop the machine from getting stuck under cabinets and refrigerators. The Roomba j7+ goes on sale today in the US and Canada from iRobot’s website and will be available for purchase at selected retailers from September 19th. It can also be bought without the cleaning base station for $649.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12’s last beta brings a few makeovers and new widgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYauF0PVHqYrRgj75ABSKpm_oUQ=/0x472:1080x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832549/Screenshot_20210908_173434.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xSzYjT"&gt;Today, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661647/android-12-final-beta-5-pixel-5a-stability-ui-changes-preview"&gt;released the final Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; before the OS properly launches, and with it a few of the visual changes and features we saw back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;when Android 12 was announced&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the notable inclusions in Beta 5 are the lovely geometric clock widgets, a redesigned calculator, and a new lock screen shortcut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Teo8Db"&gt;The clock app has also gotten some tweaks, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/google-clock-material-you-android-12-beta-5/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with an updated design, new animations, and (of course) colors that are responsive to your phone’s theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hzKaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10742007"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JtJVF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/google-calculator-8-0-brings-material-you-redesign-gallery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that Beta 5 brings the promised Material You overhaul for the calculator app as well, complete with pastel colors and more playful buttons. Here’s new vs. old:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xWoSK12GXAy8uQPhtt2qUhYF4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835822/Screen_Shot_2021_09_08_at_4.58.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new design of Calculator 8.0 in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w15OlTUVCMqM-4yGfVrDCRS-vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835831/image000000.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old design of the built-in calculator found in Android 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3CHfj6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-5-changelog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that the lock screen has a new device control shortcut that lets you control smart home devices with the tap of a button once you’ve woken your phone’s screen up. The device controls had already moved from Android 11’s power menu into the quick settings shade, but now they’re available in another, more convenient place. The button joins the Google Wallet shortcut that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/09/android-12-beta-2-wallet-toggle-comes-to-lock-screen-for-even-faster-nfc-payments/"&gt;showed up on the lock screen in Beta 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78o77H"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/08/on-android-12-beta-5-the-pixel-launchers-search-bar-can-find-almost-anything/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Pixel owners running the beta now have access to a new and improved search bar. For whatever you type in, it’ll show matching settings, contacts, and more, in addition to the app and Google results that the bar used to retrieve. We’d seen &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/13/android-12-beta-4-reveals-more-changes-for-enhanced-search-bar-functionality/"&gt;hints of this feature in previous betas&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of setting screens and APIs, but now it’s something you can actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDAhve"&gt;For some of the smaller tweaks that have shown up in Beta 5, you can read &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/android-12-beta-5-new-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-5-changelog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s complete roundups. Or, if you’d like to see the changes for yourself and have a supported device, you can follow our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442576/android-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update"&gt;guide on how to install the beta here&lt;/a&gt;. Do be warned that while the OS is set to be released “in a few weeks,” it may still have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1435677605802487810?s=20"&gt;a few rough edges here or there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fraud, or just a failure? Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’s trial opening arguments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTWHGsASAb0nnSeAiPZDgZjttws=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832361/1235132920.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, outside the courtroom | David Odisho / Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Who is Elizabeth Holmes, really?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lpIvYu"&gt;Would you rather be a failure or a fraud? Judging by the opening statements in Elizabeth Holmes’ wire fraud trial, those seem to be Holmes’ options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3gEN4"&gt;Here’s Robert Leach, assistant U.S. attorney, who is prosecuting the case against Holmes: “This is a case about fraud, about lying and cheating to get money,” Leach says. “That’s a crime on Main Street and a crime in Silicon Valley.” But according to Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, Holmes is just another failed startup leader: “In the end, Theranos failed. And Ms. Holmes walked away with nothing. But failure is not a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xPJP8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="819WPU"&gt;Now, by the time the first day of the trial ended, the first witness had only just been introduced. There are plenty more witnesses and apparently just a whole fuckload of documents ahead of us. But my impression is that the prosecution is going to have an uphill battle to show Holmes’ &lt;em&gt;intent to deceive, &lt;/em&gt;a crucial part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh3Hw4"&gt;According to the government, Theranos didn’t start life as a fraud, so that’s nice. Instead, in 2009, Holmes was rapidly running out of money. Worse, things with its pharma partners weren’t going so well — Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two huge drug companies, had cut it loose. Theranos was having a hard time making payroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="448cDt"&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” Leach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxvHYA"&gt;So Holmes started seeking investments, making the kind of grandiose startup claims we’re all familiar with from the tech industry. (Theranos was a medical company, but never mind.) Holmes gave revenue projections to Safeway that overestimated what Theranos could achieve, and gave Walgreens a report that suggested Pfizer had endorsed their tech. Leach’s allegations about a Pfizer memo that had been shown to investors were astonishing. See, according to him, it was forged. Pfizer’s letterhead might have been on the memo but Pfizer didn’t put it there. I expect we’ll be hearing from Pfizer about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Es5ZTK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vboHO"&gt;Other allegations from Leach included that Holmes misled investors about Theranos’ relationship with the military — claiming that the company’s mini analyzer was deployed in military helicopters, and saving lives, when its only relationship with the military was a small 2010 study at the Army burn center in Texas. According to Leach, Holmes also deceived investors about the readiness of the analyzer. And! Despite having zero revenue in 2012 and 2013, Holmes went around telling investors that revenue would be $140 million in 2014. (It was actually $150,000.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NppExY"&gt;We’re going to be hearing from some former Theranos employees who tried to tell Holmes and Balwani that the analyzers weren’t working as promised. One of them was fired. The other was ignored. And when Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems, she ignored him. Leach promised the jury would see “email after email” showing that Holmes was aware of the problems — but unlike the Pfizer memo, we didn’t see any specific emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZNED3"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ media persona&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance as well. According to Leach, favorable press coverage was a major way that Holmes was able to raise money — saying she “approved” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;this glowing &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; and timed up a press release with it meant to lure investors. He also said that &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; contained lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq9BOf"&gt;But those pieces do contain some truths, Leach said. Holmes was in full control of Theranos. “She owned it, she controlled it, the buck stopped with her,” Leach said. “She sweated the details. She was in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="smEgFX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEhKqk"&gt;While the prosecution was specific, the defense was playing for sympathy. Wade opened by telling us about Holmes packing up her belongings into her car after Theranos went under. Then he took us back in time to Holmes dropping out of college at 19, after patenting a miniaturized system that would perform tests and give a result. According to Wade, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately, Sunny Balwani, encouraged her to drop out. “Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes,” Wade says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0EYjA"&gt;In Wade’s telling, Holmes was a wide-eyed naif — and nothing was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; her fault. See, Balwani was responsible for the clinical labs where things were going wrong for patients, and financial modeling was also his job. Walgreens and Safeway pressured Holmes into marketing herself. So, at the suggestion of a board member, she hired marketing firm &lt;a href="https://www.tbwachiatday.com/"&gt;Chiat Day&lt;/a&gt;. (Not much mention was made of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius&lt;/a&gt;, thought we did see an ad about Theranos’ inexpensive testing.) Also, Walgreens pushed Holmes into agreeing to a phased approach to testing — Theranos hadn’t duped it into thinking it was using its own machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i9Ca0"&gt;Oh, and the inaccurate results? Sure, that can happen in any lab, Wade said. Holmes believed the tests were accurate and reliable and used them herself, as well as recommending them to her family. &lt;em&gt;Balwani&lt;/em&gt; had oversight of the labs, and besides, the lab directors are legally responsible for safe and accurate testing, not Holmes. Some of those lab directors are going to testify and I am &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;interested to hear what they have to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI7de6"&gt;And although &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;two years’ worth of Theranos’ tests were thrown out&lt;/a&gt;, Wade argued that we’ll be hearing from only &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; patients and doctors who got bad results — when 8 million tests were performed. (Wade did not bring up the tests that had been voided.) Just 20 out of 8 million is an awfully small number of inaccurate tests, Wade said. He even did some showy math for the jury: that’s 0.00025 percent of all tests. This suggests that Theranos’s tests were actually very accurate and that the prosecution is cherry-picking — but it leaves out those voided tests. That is an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; omission! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mABrTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFhE7"&gt;As further evidence that Holmes believed in Theranos, Wade announced that Holmes hadn’t sold any of her shares. “She passed on every opportunity to sell,” he said. She could have made hundreds of millions of dollars, but she was in it for the mission, not money, he said. Now, it’s kind of hard to sell shares of a private company — not impossible! — but I don’t know what kind of agreements might have been in place about her ownership stake. After the omission about the two years’ worth of tests getting shitcanned, I don’t buy much of what Wade is selling. What else is he leaving out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVzrSL"&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing. She was young, after all, and a college dropout. She worked seven days a week at Theranos but somehow could not possibly be responsible for anything except her dream of success. And while Wade hinted at the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;abuse allegations Holmes made about Balwani&lt;/a&gt; — he “sometimes had a temper, could lash out, did not always treat people kindly” and in Holmes’ relationship with him, “there was another side to it that most people never saw” — he never directly argued that abuse was a factor in Holmes’ actions. I’m guessing this is because having Holmes take the stand is a risky move, and if the case hangs on the abuse allegations, she’ll have to testify to the abuse. After all, most people didn’t even know the two of them were in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="c5uh0e"&gt;This trial is just beginning, and a lot hinges on the testimony we haven’t yet heard and emails we haven’t yet seen. But the outlines of the story each side is telling are clear. For the prosecution, proving that Holmes isn’t a dimwitted figurehead might be tough — the standard, after all, is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and Wade hammered hard on the presumption of innocence. Okay. But with so much blame being shifted to Balwani, the question arises: if the defense really wants to argue this is merely the story of failure due to naïveté, then what exactly &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;Elizabeth Holmes doing at Theranos? She was apparently breaking her back there &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; for fifteen years! Wade suggested she was primarily working on the tests and making bad decisions, but surely if that were all she was doing, she probably could have taken some weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf Hyper review: where the rubber meets the foam </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmPpxrAML7IYH-Ve7WbGOxouhSw=/0x93:2200x1560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832260/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nerf Hyper Rush-40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are these new blasters really the future of Nerf?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8Nmuu2"&gt;For nearly 30 years, Nerf has been synonymous with foam — foam balls, foam darts, and foam arrows blasted across playgrounds or over cubicle walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B0sid"&gt;For its new awesome-looking Hyper blasters, Nerf brand owner Hasbro had something different in mind. To increase their performance and capacity, it charged a small team of engineers to develop a smaller projectile using a new material. They came up with a tiny ball made of thermoplastic elastomer; effectively, rubber instead of foam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXedXj"&gt;Before they could perfect that ball, the company’s designers had to build a new set of blasters to actually fire those projectiles, too. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-HF-Blaster/dp/B083QZPGX9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The $30 Hyper Rush-40&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-Pump-Action/dp/B083QZK786/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 Siege-50&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-SMG-Blaster/dp/B083QZLSZ5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 Mach-100&lt;/a&gt; were developed at the same time as the new rounds, they told me on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSTraO"&gt;That might be why they don’t work particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hr8LD"&gt;I’ve been testing them in my local park, my backyard, and this past month, I got to try them at an actual Nerf war. Honestly, I can’t recommend them at all. And I’m still not sure whether it’s because the ammo has fundamental limitations, or whether this first wave of blasters just misses the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVss73"&gt;Let’s discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7IL4B3gKI29S1FtlRHjcCLCvNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835515/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top to bottom: Rush-40, Siege-50, Mach-100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gg26Rd"&gt;Dream vs. reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4z5zSQ"&gt;When I was a kid, you’d have to reload most Nerf blasters after every single shot. Only the biggest, bulkiest and most inaccurate two-handed toys let you do more. When I returned to Nerf as an adult, a five-shot revolver you could prime with your thumb was a revelation, and yet you’d still have to carry a bulky drum magazine to feed a rifle with more than 18 darts at a time. It was only 2017 when the company finally released &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $100 blaster&lt;/a&gt; that could fit enough ammo to hold down a fort thanks to a gigantic hopper-fed system that held 100 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDR9b"&gt;So when Nerf announced its new Hyper ammo was small enough to cram 40 shots into a pistol or 100 into an SMG-sized blaster, plus paintball-style canisters to top up, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it sounded like a dream&lt;/a&gt;: we’d finally be able to battle without constantly thinking about the next reload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KdlrE"&gt;Instead, I’m constantly thinking about whether my blaster will actually shoot when I pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k9YOaqEeIjjUbi-uvSmjIlPsp34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835611/verge_sean_hollister_20210907.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prime the spring-powered Rush-40, you pull back on the entire slide, hopper and all. But you’ll have to point it down first. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAzvKk"&gt;Whether you pick the Rush-40, Siege-50 or Mach-100, their integrated ammo boxes all rely on gravity to feed rounds into the chamber, and these rounds don’t always want to go in. If you actually stuff 40 tiny yellow balls into a Rush-40, or 50 of them into a Siege-50, they might not have enough room to reach the chute at all. Even if you don’t, they need to slide down the slope just right to reach the inner chamber. Mess it up, and nothing will happen when you pull the trigger, just a puff of air. So far, my best bet has been to point the blaster down to the ground each time I prime it — but that means not keeping it aimed at my target. It’s a real disadvantage in a fast-paced Nerf battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNcb"&gt;Even with the Mach-100, which has a dedicated mechanical agitator and conveyor belt to keep the balls moving, it can be a problem: the supposedly full-auto blaster would often pop just a few balls at a time, then pause, then fart out two at once, sometimes with dramatically reduced range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_OxRfNJFgLzNmT4mvvNXDEYjacw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835554/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the Rival Perses with its lightweight rechargeable pack, the similar Hyper Mach-100 requires 6 D batteries. I wouldn’t want to hold it this way for long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vdGYQb"&gt;And even when they do fire, you can’t expect them to go anywhere near where their blaster’s built-in aiming sights are pointed. With the Rush-40 pistol and Mach-100 SMG in particular, their shots almost immediately curve right down to the ground, forcing you to aim much higher than your target and rain balls down. I did get some tags this way, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imtUeo"&gt;It also mystifies me why Hasbro produced paintball-like hoppers and pods for easy refills without giving them a way to mate. Every time I whip out one of the cool canisters, which smartly attach to each blaster’s built-in rails, I inevitably dump a bunch of them on the ground, because the loading doors and flip-top canister don’t match up at all. Hasbro designer Rob Maschin says the team would love to change that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYOFAC"&gt;This is all a shame, because in many ways these Hyper balls are the best projectiles Nerf’s made in years. While they’re the same dimpled shape as the company’s larger foam Rival balls, the new TPE rounds are far denser and fly further. They’re &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaA_xTaRa7I"&gt;easy to wash&lt;/a&gt;, not terribly hard to pick up with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Weasel-Small-Nut-Gatherer/dp/B0173P3O16/ref=asc_df_B0173P3O16/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=216531775325&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=4657220126082372686&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-370918601718&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small nut gatherer&lt;/a&gt;, and their electric yellow makes them incredibly easy to spot on the ground. No word on whether they’re biodegradable should someone decide to be lazy, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhpWdm"&gt;“We produced probably a dozen different colors and just threw them out into a lawn out back to see which is easiest to see — that neon yellow popped,” Nerf brand manager Greg Nyland told me. It’s true: despite being smaller than Rival, they catch my eye at a distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xQLHlQjJ3eiQQRZhNJptaQI6oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835532/verge_sean_hollister_20210516.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tall grass doesn’t necessarily present an issue...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiwshh9tYZryrU-yTdJ8_Ey3e4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835535/verge_sean_hollister_20210904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but clumpy turf can. There are three balls hidden in this picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MuRkR"&gt;You can even use a black light to find them at night, since they’re UV-reactive. They do bounce everywhere and roll all over the place, and could get lost in storm grates, but the only time I personally had trouble was in dense, clumpy grass where they’d fall into little pockets of turf and I had to be standing at the right angle to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0la05v"&gt;Perhaps as importantly, the blasters can spit out these rounds more powerfully than anything else Hasbro will let you buy on a shelf. I consistently saw all three blasters exceeding 100 feet per second on my chronograph, with the Rush-40 and Siege-50 regularly crossing the 115 feet per second mark. And while those balls did dive into the ground when I fired flat, I measured ranges of up to 150 feet with my distance measuring wheel after I angled shots up into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wjOiyXE8c5kJhMS9iqVMgqCYUgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835543/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rush-40 and the Kronos are practically the same blaster but with a different ammo type.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="grhWHI"&gt;To get a sense of how much performance has changed, I compared the Hyper Rush-40 to the Rival Kronos — since the Rush is largely just a Kronos with the new projectiles on board. As you can see in the chart, the Rush’s maximum range absolutely dwarfs the Kronos, but at the expense of range when shot flat. With the old Kronos, I can sometimes hit things I see in my sights, but I found little reason to aim with Hyper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULwUE2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741937"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TV7YQy"&gt;Range isn’t the whole story, though. The Hyper rounds hit harder (I asked friends to shoot me in the face), so it’s more obvious when you’ve been tagged. They travel faster and don’t loft in the air quite like Rival rounds, so they’ll likely be harder to dodge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctMFVT"&gt;Speaking of lofting and range, Hasbro surprisingly omitted a feature from two of these blasters typically used to improve both: a little rubber nub called a “hop-up” that adds backspin to the ball, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect"&gt;taking advantage of the Magnus effect&lt;/a&gt; to fly through the air. But the Rush-40 and Mach-100 mysteriously don’t have a hop-up, even though the Rival blasters they’re based on (the aforementioned Rival Kronos and Rival Perses) most definitely do. And while the Siege-50 has one, mine barely worked. Still, some Nerfers have &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Og-ht0nN354?t=742"&gt;already created&lt;/a&gt; 3D printed aftermarket hop-ups for the Rush-40 that seem to improve their accuracy. It’s likely Hasbro’s future Hyper blasters will, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLOejC"&gt;I’m less certain why Hyper rounds feed so poorly, but I have a theory. To make them safe, Hasbro made them squishy, and now they’re &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; gummy to avoid sticking on each other when they’re crammed into a hopper. I imagine they could even jam blasters if not for the Hyper hoppers’ tilt-down-to-load feeding chutes, which ensure only one round gets chambered at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIZYCvBTa8e57KcL8o1NVSOu4Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835619/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper vs. Rival vs. Elite vs. Mega ammo size comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYcbNroOpMLwSJw9dU67j57o8Gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835620/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squishing both Rival and Hyper balls. My thumb sinks into Rival a little like a pillow, while the gummy Hyper bulges out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzMJFh"&gt;It’s tricky. If Hasbro had simply made its foam Rival balls smaller, they would have been lighter too, which isn’t necessarily helpful for speed and accuracy. But if you make them denser to fix those things, they aren’t quite as soft — and as Hasbro veteran engineer Bob DeRoche explained on the call, every single blaster the company makes has to meet its Kinetic Energy Disbursement (KED) standard for safety. “Based on the speed, the weight, the diameter, and how much that disperses, you have to be under that KED number. If it’s under that, you’re safe — it’ll hurt your eye, it won’t feel good, but it won’t damage your eye, he says.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6rC3m"&gt;Technically, every single Hyper blaster comes with a pair of safety glasses too — a first for a Nerf product, I believe — and prominent warning labels about wearing them in the field. But the primary safety mechanism was building a TPE pellet with the right squish, and the team admits that squish was a challenge for the blasters — which, remember, they had to develop simultaneously. “We didn’t have that luxury of time,” says DeRoche. “When we first got those samples of the round and got closer to what we wanted, we were still getting into the final state of not being as tacky or sticky,” adding that it was “problematic” to keep them fluffed and loose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xku9bQ"&gt;That’s why Hasbro decided to start with hopper-fed blasters to begin with, as opposed to compression feeding systems like a spring-loaded magazine. Nyland suggests we shouldn’t rule out other feeding mechanisms, though, pointing to just how much Nerf’s Rival line evolved since its 2015 debut, too. I have to admit he’s got a point: &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/nerf-rival-review-the-evolution-of-foam-warfare-1730896686"&gt;the first Rival blasters showed off serious potential&lt;/a&gt;, but their tiny magazines and terrible ergonomics were vastly improved just a couple years later. I’d be excited to see co-branded &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; blasters that can actually fit a decent number of shots inside, but I wonder whether the gummy rounds will ever work in a truly enclosed space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A6lurj"&gt;The competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SqAmc0"&gt;But the real reason to skip Hyper — for now — isn’t any of these issues. It’s that Hyper doesn’t compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB4ZDH"&gt;Not only does Hyper require you to buy into a new, unproven ammo type that likely won’t be available at your local Nerf war, Hasbro’s expecting teens and young adults to see them as the blaster of choice for sporting-grade Nerf, and that’s just not the reality today. The sporting part of the Nerf community is increasingly standardizing on half-length of the same size of dart that Hasbro’s blasters have used for years, to the point nearly every player at my last Nerf war had at least one short dart blaster in their loadout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y11ga"&gt;Modern short darts from brands like Worker and Dart Zone fly so straight you can consistently hit things you aim at. They’re cheap, too: typically between 8 and 10 cents per dart, compared to the 15 to 21 cents you’ll pay per Hyper ball right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AyalQZsCAr52niuU_fM-t22wYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835617/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $40, I’d buy a Dart Zone Conquest Pro over a Nerf Hyper Siege-50 any day of the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="np2GvQ"&gt;And you don’t need to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"&gt;the kind of incredible 3D printed blasters we featured here&lt;/a&gt; to get started, because an upstart rival named Dart Zone is making it increasingly easy to get into short darts, too. For the same $40 you’d pay for Hasbro’s Hyper Siege-50, you could hit up a Walmart for the similar pump-action-shotgun-esque &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Conquest-Pro-Half-Length-Ultimate-Dart-Blaster%2F185917597&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dart Zone Conquest Pro&lt;/a&gt; instead, and have 15 darts that actually fly where you aim them with just as much power and without the feeding issues. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Pro-Blaster-Ammo-Clip-Refill-Compatible-with-Nexus-Pro-Aeon-Pro-and-Conquest-Pro%2F476510661&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 more buys a pair of additional magazines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-100-Half-Length-Pro-Dart-Refill-Shoots-Over-125-FT%2F809673491%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26wl13%3D2031%26adid%3D22222222420449455996%26wmlspartner%3Dwmtlabs%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501107745824%26wl4%3Dpla-293946777986%26wl5%3D9032047%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D809673491%26wl13%3D2031%26veh%3Dsem_LIA%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AiX0wrzxpgItQh7nSJEEwEbA9uySZFYYznU2JDWfTJ1CndnRZbrX91BoC8wUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 additional darts&lt;/a&gt;, compared to $12 (on sale!) for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NER-H-Refill-Canister-50/dp/B0851GQJ1G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a canister of just 50 Hyper rounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vK2A4Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won’t touch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gw9tVp"&gt;I was able to keep some foes pinned down with the Mach-100, and I got some tags with the others too, but I spent most of my time wishing I had something more reliable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do4kK6"&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I don’t understand about Hasbro’s foam-flinging strategy is why it let this competition go unchecked, instead of building better darts itself. It was Nerf that popularized the foam dart &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Nerf/History"&gt;some 29 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but the competition’s short darts and even full-lengths fly so much better than any projectile Hasbro has ever made. Perhaps that’s intentional for safety reasons, or for fun? (I do remember when dodging darts all &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style was a great part of the game.) But Walmart seems perfectly happy to carry Dart Zone’s more powerful and accurate blasters, and without requiring bundled safety glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WzaAH6"&gt;Maybe Hyper will surprise us, but after this slow start and the company’s forgettable Ultra and Elite 2.0 lines (both of which performed worse than previous blasters in a number of ways), I’m hoping Hasbro might take a harder look at how it can truly compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzsVNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9jfUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 percent off the typical list price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $90 ($45 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids+ service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. We’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;As far as deals go, you can currently pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $85 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $105&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $110; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $125&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $115&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $140&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JA82PQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google settles with worker allegedly fired for his workplace activism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z09WWoC_zhwdLcsWCe8VaMjVrZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831999/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N0gM6"&gt;Google reached a settlement with a fired employee who the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims was let go from the company for his workplace activism, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-settles-with-employee-allegedly-fired-for-activism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The employee, Laurence Berland, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout"&gt;fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt; allegedly for violating Google’s data security policies. He had been a vocal critic of Google’s work with the US Customs and Border Protection and was terminated amid internal organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS1ix5"&gt;The settlement was approved in July by the NLRB, though the terms haven’t been revealed, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JGpO7"&gt;The NLRB has accused Google of violating labor law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;in firing Berland and four other workers in 2019&lt;/a&gt; over organizing activities and is still battling Google over those accusations. One employee, Kathryn Spiers, was allegedly fired for creating an internal pop-up message reminding workers of their labor rights; Google said she didn’t have the proper approval for sending that code, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;according to Spiers&lt;/a&gt;. The other employees, including Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke, say they were fired for &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/google-fired-us-for-organizing-were-fighting-back-d0daa8113aed"&gt;participating in protected labor organizing&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; they were let go for violating the company’s data security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood opens up a slow and steady approach to crypto investing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAx739oeJkBvBYXjsyshW26hazM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831985/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dDfHN7"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/8/crypto-recurring-investments-are-here"&gt;rolling out a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you automatically invest in cryptocurrencies on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. The investment app says this service will let you automatically invest in things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/commission-free-cryptocurrency-investing/"&gt;other supported cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; without a commission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNfTJL"&gt;Before we go any further, though, I should warn you that nothing in this article is qualified or expert financial advice. It’s probably wise to talk with an expert who can help you come up with an investment strategy that’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJnKju"&gt;Robinhood’s approach here is automatic investing, not trading. It won’t sell the crypto for you when an algorithm decides it’d make financial sense to do so. Instead, it’s just steadily building your crypto portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ULJEeFxrxuBnYWeERs0Vog40w8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835317/Recurring_Flow_9_8_Update.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of what recurring crypto investments looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26ozn"&gt;Robinhood pitches this as a way to do “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJgJqEOOQ4"&gt;dollar-cost averaging&lt;/a&gt;,” which is more or less financial speak for not worrying about what the market is doing and instead investing the same amount regularly, letting the gains and losses come out in the wash. In other words, you’re adhering to the financial maxim “time in the market beats timing the market.” Of course, in this case, the market isn’t an index fund or anything like that; it’s cryptocurrencies, which have a reputation for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660932/crypto-exchanges-el-salvador-bitcoin-price-dip"&gt;being rather volatile&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the strategy works for Bitcoin et al. is probably a question for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/crypto-ceo-uses-dollar-cost-averaging-to-buy-bitcoin.html"&gt;more finance-focused publications&lt;/a&gt; and experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3acWX"&gt;The concept of “HODLing,” or holding, has long been a meme in the crypto and WallStreetBets communities. They’ll sometimes encourage people to keep their stocks through whatever losses may come in hopes of selling them for a profit in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGdjbQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s approach is a traditional finance method applied to crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYdwIQ"&gt;There are other cryptocurrencies that try to reward users for holding in different ways. Coinbase has been giving users extra coins for &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/07/coinbase-will-now-reward-users-for-holding-this-cryptocurrency/"&gt;keeping certain cryptocurrencies since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That kind of system is actually the basis of an alternative mining system called proof-of-stake, which looks to solve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the energy demands&lt;/a&gt; of the more traditional proof-of-work systems. In proof-of-stake systems, miners put up their crypto as collateral for a chance to create a block, and if they're chosen, they’ll get a reward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV35pI"&gt;However, Robinhood’s approach is much more in the vein of traditional finance methods, just applied to new tech. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that the feature isn’t available to users in New York, a major financial center in the US. The company says that the feature will be “gradually” rolling out to its users throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Addison Rae signs Netflix film deal after going from TikTok to He’s All That</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“He’s All That” Special Screening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1BHQXVzFpM6AHTUMpvA-grxOMc=/0x0:4988x3325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831966/1336432090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xd8D2W"&gt;Netflix is doubling down on TikTok star Addison Rae with &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/addison-rae-enters-multi-picture-creative-partnership-with-netflix"&gt;a new multi-picture film deal&lt;/a&gt; that could see the social media celebrity bringing even more eyes to the streaming service, As part of the deal, Netflix will develop projects specifically for Rae to star in and executive produce (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/addison-rae-tiktok-netflix-hes-all-that-1235052075/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e15qed"&gt;The motivation seems to be the early success of &lt;em&gt;He’s All That&lt;/em&gt;, the gender-swapped remake of &lt;em&gt;She’s All That, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;first announced in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company projects the film will be watched by more than 55 million households in the first month of release and says it reached #1 on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;the company’s chart&lt;/a&gt; “in 78 countries, including Brazil, France, and Saudi Arabia.” Critical reception to&lt;em&gt; He’s All That&lt;/em&gt; has been mixed, from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22643642/hes-all-that-review-netflix-remake"&gt;surprisingly positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/tiktoker-addison-rae-promotes-some-brands-in-netflix-s-1847556794"&gt;rightfully dismissive&lt;/a&gt;, but that might not matter. Netflix’s director of family film Naketha Mattocks believes Rae’s promise is “undeniable as evidenced by&lt;em&gt; He’s All That &lt;/em&gt;and her already passionate fan base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ixn1G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social media stars are breaking through on streaming platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZjLOB"&gt;Netflix’s numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt, though. The company doesn’t open its full data up to others, and its metrics for what counts as a “view” are very different from a box office receipt or Nielsen rating. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;watching at least two minutes of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;counts as a view by Netflix’s standards. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313325/apple-tv-plus-billie-eilish-documentary-numbers-box-office-streaming-netflix-hulu"&gt;Some of that opaqueness&lt;/a&gt; and “flexibility” is par for the course in the streaming era, but it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shYtPN"&gt;Still, Rae is immensely popular, with around 84 million followers on Tiktok alone, so it follows she’d bring some kind of audience to whatever future projects Netflix cooks up. Along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189180/charli-damelio-dixie-hulu-reality-series-documentary-tiktok-kardashians"&gt;the similarly TikTok famous D’Amelio family&lt;/a&gt;, Rae is part of a recent wave of influencers and creators trying to push into other mediums. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/02/damelio-rae-netflix-hulu/"&gt;There’s been concern they’d falter&lt;/a&gt; in ways similar earlier online stars did while transitioning to old-school forms of showbiz razzle-dazzle, but Rae’s deal may be a sign things are changing.&lt;/p&gt;
