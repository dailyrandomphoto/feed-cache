    <title>Watch Joby Aviation’s electric air taxi complete a 150-mile flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cupr_qOWdSn59_XVg8qeSdQlW-c=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638491/Joby_aircraft.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0F9iUM"&gt;Electric air taxis aren’t a real thing yet, but a host of well-financed startups are out to change that. Chief among them is Joby Aviation, an electric aviation company based in Northern California that just posted a noteworthy video of its six-rotor aircraft completing an impressive 150-mile flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEvLu"&gt;Granted, it doesn’t sound too impressive, but it’s actually among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft. It’s equivalent to a trip between Seattle and Vancouver, or Los Angeles to San Diego — the type of regional trip conducted hundreds of times a day by regional partners to major airlines. Swapping out those polluting airplanes for a zero-emissions aircraft like Joby’s could be a major step toward the reduction of CO2 emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kOIeP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i29d2p"&gt;The company, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;backed by Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;acquired Uber’s flying taxi division&lt;/a&gt;, has said that it plans to have a full-scale air taxi service in operation by 2024, including regional trips. The point of the 150-mile flight was to demonstrate how far its aircraft could fly on a single charge, to allay concerns about the vehicle’s range and battery. If you want to fly from New York City to Montauk, Joby wanted to show that it can get you there without running out of juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nT2B4l"&gt;“We’ve achieved something that many thought impossible with today’s battery technology,” JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, said in a statement. “By doing so we’ve taken the first step towards making convenient, emissions-free air travel between places like San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, Houston and Austin, or Los Angeles and San Diego an everyday reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DdfO6V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xysDJ6"&gt;Rather than fly between two points, Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes. It’s an impressive feat, given the challenges of electric flight. The power-to-weight ratio is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;biggest inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a given system — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground. To weigh it out: jet fuel gives us about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk8aIO"&gt;But Joby says that its commercially available lithium-ion batteries have been specially adapted for aerospace uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="56LfSK"&gt;An 811 NMC cathode and a graphite anode cell were selected, following internal testing, to deliver the optimal trade-off between the specific energy required to fly the aircraft 150 miles, the specific power to take-off and land vertically and the cycle life to deliver an affordable service. We have demonstrated in the lab that this battery is capable of more than 10,000 of our expected nominal flight cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="90FfoL"&gt;The team developing Joby’s energy system is led by Jon Wagner, head of powertrain and electronics, who previously led battery engineering at Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdjhrp"&gt;It helps that Joby is starting small with a five-seater vehicle. Higher capacity aircraft won’t come until the energy density in the current batteries improves. But Joby has a financial buffer, having just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;gone public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. As part of the deal, Joby will get $1.6 billion in cash, which it will use to continue to tinker and perfect its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRdygE"&gt;The question is: will it be enough to get the company to 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Sony ZV-E10 is an E-mount camera for vloggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uxa1TITpx657RpcTJf1oTgdbKFc=/0x84:2015x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638487/zve10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZV-E10 features an E-mount for interchangeable lenses and a large, 24-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="raXxxl"&gt;Sony has announced the ZV-E10, an APS-C interchangeable lens camera it hopes will appeal to the needs of vloggers. It brings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;many of the features we liked from the fixed-lens ZV-1&lt;/a&gt; into a bigger sensor format, including shortcuts to focus and exposure settings vloggers may need to access quickly. Being a bigger camera, there are also some significant benefits that the pocketable ZV-1 didn’t have the real estate to accommodate, like a headphone jack, better battery life, and a larger sensor with more depth-of-field flexibility. And at $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens, it’s a pretty good deal — just over the ZV-1’s current $749 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b0f0n"&gt;While the ZV-E10 addresses many of our complaints with the ZV-1, the latter still has one feature not offered in the new camera: hardware-based image stabilization. While the ZV-1 included stabilization built into the lens, the ZV-E10 only offers electronic stabilization. To supplement this, it also includes the ability to record gyro sensor data in metadata that can be utilized when applying stabilization in post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LGv8qH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10671612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oHpaCL"&gt;The ZV-E10 offers a 24.2-megapixel sensor with a native ISO range of 100-32,000 equipped with the excellent eye and subject-tracking AF both the ZV-1 and Sony’s recent interchangeable-lens cameras offer. It also includes the ZV-1’s vlogger-friendly Bokeh Switch mode, which toggles the aperture to blur your background or bring it into focus, as well as a Product Showcase mode to apply AF settings best suited for presenting products on camera. There’s a fully articulated touchscreen display for easier operation from in front of the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9EWzA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XnhV8"&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage. Hybrid log-gamma, S-Log2, and S-Log3 profiles are included for videographers who plan to grade footage after capture. Slow-motion footage can be recorded up to 1080/120p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gflbTl"&gt;Microphone and 3.5mm headphone jacks are included, and a three-capsule directional microphone is built in with a windscreen included in the box. Live streaming via USB is supported for phones with Android 11, though not yet available with iOS devices. The ZV-E10 claims up to 80 minutes of video recording on a single battery charge, which is almost double the ZV-1’s claimed 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlmhce"&gt;The Sony ZV-1 will go on sale in August for $699 body-only or $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It looks like Fortnite’s next big event is happening on August 6th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLt2Mcxds1aWUVNeecQNW62L0z4=/584x0:3221x1758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638321/Fortnite_20210727091441.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFKsvC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s next big live event appears to be very close. After the game’s most recent update, a new alien ship can be found hovering over the center of the battle royale island, projecting a clock counting down to August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VOzIP3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSsaSA"&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s history with live events — which have included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Galactus attack&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;an island-destroying black hole&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;an actual single-player mission&lt;/a&gt; — it seems likely this countdown will end in the latest such moment. Developer Epic, as always, is being cryptic about what’s happening. “Its intent doesn’t seem to be for harm,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v17-21-update-the-plasma-cannon-enters-the-invasion"&gt;the developer says of the ship&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s predicted its purpose will become clearer in the near future.” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;Previous leaks&lt;/a&gt; have also suggested an Ariana Grande concert is coming to the game, though it’s unclear if the pop star has any connection to the alien invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C57Dzk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current alien-themed season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;kicked off on June 8th&lt;/a&gt;, changing the battle royale game with all kinds of new alien weapons and terrain. Since then, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has seen a steady stream of updates and events, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;a trippy concert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585705/fortnite-short-nite-2-film-festival-party-royale-july-23rd"&gt;a short film festival&lt;/a&gt;, and new characters like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553914/fortnite-crew-loki-release-date"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583750/fortnite-world-cup-champion-bugha-skin-release-date"&gt;Bugha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing officially reveals its $99 Ear (1) true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdZyatk3QZNGyNso3J3B6lbX6cI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638162/Nothing_ear__1__ladybirds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ear (1) earbud perched atop its charging case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6gBSR"&gt;Nothing, the consumer tech startup led by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, has officially announced its Ear (1) true wireless earbuds. The noise-canceling buds launch after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564819/nothing-earbuds-price-noise-cancellation-anc"&gt;teases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;concept images&lt;/a&gt;, and even a presale in which Nothing &lt;a href="https://nothing.tech/blogs/news/nothing-partners-with-stockx-on-first-ever-electronics-dropx"&gt;auctioned off 100 pairs of the earbuds&lt;/a&gt; prior to their official reveal. The Ear (1) earbuds will go on sale on August 17th across 45 countries including the US and UK, priced at $99 / £99 / €99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHqzqV"&gt;In a statement, Pei calls the Ear (1) “a breath of fresh air in a cluttered and indifferent market,” and said the earbuds will “[set] the tone for our connected digital world to come.” Pei has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; his plan for Nothing is to build up an ecosystem of devices across increasingly complex product categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlcLzjKPczsxGP8piI4L5Zw1asA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740803/ear__1__R__white_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get 5.7 hours of playback from the earbuds themselves...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olxHasTN6oNgTzNkdYjSv5joxfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740804/ear__1__case_and_earbuds__transparent_background_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and up to 34 hours when used with the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBteut"&gt;With a design based around transparent plastic, the Ear (1)’s have a distinctive look that reveals some of their internal circuitry, and each earbud has a color-coded circle (red or white) to indicate the corresponding ear. They’re equipped with 11.6mm drivers, and Nothing’s hardware and software have both been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;tuned by Swedish electronics house Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8dT2E"&gt;Battery life is rated at up to 34 hours when the earbuds are used with their charging case, and 5.7 hours from the earbuds themselves with ANC off (dropping to 24 hours and four hours with ANC on, respectively). They can be charged wirelessly using Qi-compatible chargers or wired over USB-C. The Ear (1)’s use a trio of microphones on each earbud to offer noise-cancelation, which can be set to maximum for loud environments, light if it’s quieter, and there’s a transparency mode for when you need to hear what’s going on around you. The earbuds also cancel out background noise when using their microphones to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gls3jdgfVRE289FWTx-52OefuS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740788/Nothing_ear__1__lifestyle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear (1) uses transparent plastic in its construction to reveal some internal circuitry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WtQvJB"&gt;The Ear (1)s have tap and gesture controls, and these can be customized via a companion app which also handles EQ and Find my Earbud functionality. They feature Bluetooth 5.2 and they’re IPX4 water resistant, which should allow them to survive sweat and light splashes. Fast pairing will be supported with compatible Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA3ySd"&gt;While the earbuds will go on general sale next month, Nothing is selling a limited batch of the earbuds from its own website starting on July 31st. We’ll have a full review of the Ear (1) earbuds coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s second-gen Echo Buds are down to their lowest price since Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXFGg7zJrqdUzOuMNf2bn2UvaHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638077/DSCF3852_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The second-gen Echo Buds surpass their predecessors with better noise cancellation and sound. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3kGzHg"&gt;Unsurprisingly, Staples isn’t the only retailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/26/22593999/apple-airpods-pro-homepod-mini-brydge-ipad-surface-keyboard-deal-sale"&gt;discounting the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and other earbuds in the buildup to the fall semester. Best Buy, for instance, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747339834917966859#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a sizable $40 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds, bringing the price of both the white and black models down to their lowest price since Prime Day. Now on sale for $80, the 2021 Echo Buds build upon their predecessors in a variety of ways, offering up effective noise cancellation, solid sound, and a first-rate passthrough mode that allows you to stay in tune with the world around you. They also support hands-free Alexa, meaning you can quickly check the weather, queue up your Discover Weekly in Spotify, and carry out a host of other voice-enabled tasks without ever reaching for your phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lP6M9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cB2T9"&gt;Apple’s official space gray accessories for the Mac &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436719/apple-space-gray-magic-trackpad-keyboard-mouse-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;may be discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, but there are some good alternatives if you’re looking to maintain aesthetics. Outfitted with a number pad, USB-C support, and backlit keys, Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard is a great case in point. The full-size wireless keyboard — which dons a space gray exterior and works with macOS and iOS — also features up to 10 days of battery life with the backlighting turned on, and the ability to connect to and quickly switch between three devices via Bluetooth. The &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Flogitech-mx-keys-wireless-keyboard-space-gray-920-009552%2Fproduct_24450769" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless Mac keyboard&lt;/a&gt; usually retails for $100 but is on sale at Staples for $80 with offer code &lt;strong&gt;32547 &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="S1NAda"&gt;If you’re in need of storage for your Nintendo Switch, phone, or camera, you rarely have to look beyond SanDisk. The well-known company produces some of the most reliable and affordable microSD cards in existence, with fast write speeds and a range of configurations that often go on sale. Right now, for example, Costco members can snag a two-pack of &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/sandisk-256gb-microsdxc-card-for-the-nintendo-switch,-2-pack.product.100675941.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s 256GB microSD cards&lt;/a&gt; for $60, more than 30 percent off the initial list price and the lowest price we’ve seen on the versatile, no-frills bundle. Don’t let the Mario-themed design and Nintendo branding fool you — the cards work just as well with other devices as they do Nintendo’s handheld.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch’s data ‘black box’ poses research problems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXR6BFEtdkswsLXeA9o2nffDijY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638061/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wyuJbq"&gt;A Harvard biostatistician is rethinking plans to use Apple Watches as part of a research study after finding inconsistencies in the heart rate variability data collected by the devices. Because Apple tweaks the watch’s algorithms as needed, the data from the same time period can change without warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0EuKP"&gt;“These algorithms are what we would call black boxes — they’re not transparent. So it’s impossible to know what’s in them,” JP Onnela, associate professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and developer of the open-source data platform Beiwe, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttq0Sr"&gt;Onnela doesn’t usually include commercial wearable devices like the Apple Watch in research studies. For the most part, his teams use research-grade devices that are designed to collect data for scientific studies. As part of a collaboration with the department of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, though, he was interested in the commercially available products. He knew that there were sometimes data issues with those products, and his team wanted to check how severe they were before getting started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlJ8xl"&gt;So, they checked in on heart rate data his collaborator Hassan Dawood, a research fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, exported from his Apple Watch. Dawood exported his daily heart rate variability data twice: once on September 5th, 2020 and a second time on April 15th, 2021. For the experiment, they looked at data collected over the same stretch of time — from early December 2018 to September 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TrYWaX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because the two exported datasets included data from the same time period, the data from both sets should theoretically be identical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqyYDD"&gt;Because the two exported datasets included data from the same time period, the data from both sets should theoretically be identical. Onnela says he was expecting some differences. The “black box” of wearable algorithms is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;consistent challenge&lt;/a&gt; for researchers. Rather than showing the raw data collected by a device, the products usually only let researchers export information after it has been analyzed and filtered through an algorithm of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TvG6Z"&gt;Companies change their algorithms regularly and without warning, so the September 2020 export may have included data analyzed using a different algorithm than the April 2021 export. “What was surprising was how different they were,” he says. “This is probably the cleanest example that I have seen of this phenomenon.” He published the data in a &lt;a href="https://www.beiwe.org/exporting-the-same-data-from-a-wearable-twice-doesnt-give-you-the-same-data/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpr9lBsmSrREYW-h7ZlxnOJXgeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740584/HRV_plot_2048x692.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beiwe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing the heart rate variability data collected at the two different time points shows big differences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EkZA2d"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsD1Me"&gt;It was striking to see the differences laid out so clearly, says Olivia Walch, a sleep researcher who works with wearable and app data at the University of Michigan. Walch has long advocated for researchers to use raw data — data pulled directly from a device’s sensors, instead of filtered through its software. “It’s validating, because I get on my little soapbox about the raw data, and it’s nice to have a concrete example where it would really matter,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOyi5o"&gt;Constantly changing algorithms makes it almost prohibitively difficult to use commercial wearables for sleep research, Walch says. Sleep studies are already expensive. “Are you going to be able to strap four FitBits on someone, each running a different version of the software, and then compare them? Probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW7H5i"&gt;Companies have incentives to change their algorithms to make their products better. “They’re not super incentivized to tell us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they’re changing things,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN73PU"&gt;That’s a problem for research. Onnela compared it to tracking body weight. “If I wanted to jump on a scale every week, I should be using the same scale every time,” he says. If that scale was tweaked without him knowing about it, the day-to-day changes in weight wouldn’t be reliable. For someone who has just a casual interest in tracking their health, that may be fine — the differences aren’t going to be major. But in research, consistency matters. “That’s the concern,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uycTL4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maybe you would have a completely different result if you just been using a different model.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pUdzXy"&gt;Someone could, for example, run a study using a wearable and come to a conclusion about how people’s sleep patterns changed based on adjustments in their environment. But that conclusion might only be true with that particular version of the wearable’s software. “Maybe you would have a completely different result if you just been using a different model,” Walch says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E8kp5"&gt;Dawood’s Apple Watch data isn’t from a study and is just one informal example. But it shows the importance of being cautious with commercial devices that don’t allow access to raw data, Onnela says. It was enough to make his team back away from plans to use the devices in studies. He thinks commercial wearables should only be used if raw data is available, or — at minimum — if researchers are able to get a heads-up when an algorithm is going to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnliQy"&gt;There might be some situations where wearable data could still be useful. The heart rate variability information showed similar trends at both time points — the data went up and down at the same times. “If you’re caring about stuff on that macro scale, then you can make the call that you’d keep using the device,” Walch says. But if the specific heart rate variability calculated on each day matters for a study, the Apple Watch may be riskier to rely on, she says. “It should give people pause about using certain wearables, if the rug runs the risk of being ripped out underneath their feet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest now lets influencers make money off shoppable pins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btXcwi6Dcv1fIndaDSXfn8CQgSA=/0x0:1428x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638019/Idea_Pin_Product_Tagging_Branded_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pinterest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7dgZk"&gt;Pinterest is going after the influencer market. The platform announced its first set of tools today to let content creators earn money by promoting items from around the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFw1S"&gt;The platform is adding support for affiliate links, letting creators get a cut of purchases they drive. It’s also adding product tagging to its story-like Idea Pins to drive sales from more places, and it’s adding a new “paid partnerships” label to support sponsorships within Idea Pins. The updates come a few months after the platform launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/creatorcode"&gt;$500,000 fund&lt;/a&gt; for BIPOC creators and sharpens the company’s focus on shopping as other platforms, like Instagram, start to take on shopping, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Knufkr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s all a way to promote shopping on the platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6WwYY"&gt;Businesses can already upload “Product Pins” to Pinterest, which allow people to click through to find and then buy a product. Creators will now be able to browse these available product pins and integrate them into their Idea Pins, thereby making content with the product and making it easier for potential buyers to understand what they’re seeing and how to use it. The creators can also add their own affiliate links to these tags, allowing them to make money off any product sold. It’s all a way to promote shopping on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxfYKF"&gt;Availability varies, but the product tagging tool within Idea Pins will launch for all business accounts in the US and UK, with access rolling out over the coming months to international creators. The paid partnerships tool is now live for select creators in the US, UK, and Canada, along with 16 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdgEoQ"&gt;The big idea here is clearly for Pinterest to make it easier for people on its platform to sell the things they’re already promoting and for users to more easily purchase whatever supplies they realize they need to make the various Pinterest project ideas they see come to life. Other platforms have also capitalized on shopping. Instagram, as likely the biggest example, created a full shopping tab in its app, allows for product tagging, and makes it easy for brands and creators to partner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify makes paid shows from Slate, Acast, and more playable from its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWQHwhRyGlfy_V_0z9IhuU2qwTI=/0x0:1045x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69637961/dithering.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6Y1eU"&gt;Spotify wants to be the place you listen to all your podcasts, even the ones you pay for outside the app, so today’s it’s making that a possibility. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-27/here-are-the-first-publishers-and-platforms-getting-connected-with-spotifys-open-access-feature/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; multiple new partnerships today that’ll allow paid shows from third-party platforms and networks to be played on the app — something that’s been impossible until now because Spotify doesn’t support private RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5c6tej"&gt;Among the platforms supporting the tech, called Open Access, are Acast, Memberful, Supporting Cast, Glow.fm, and Supercast. Networks supporting the tech include Vox Media and, more specifically, its Cafe Studios; Slate; Der Spiegel; and Mamamia. (Disclosure: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is owned by Vox Media.) You can see the full list &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-27/here-are-the-first-publishers-and-platforms-getting-connected-with-spotifys-open-access-feature/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with each platform and network making more specific announcements around launch timing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5f2YkH"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;first previewed&lt;/a&gt; this technology, which is based on OAuth, in April. Initial partners included Ben Thompson and John Gruber’s show &lt;em&gt;Dithering&lt;/em&gt;. For supporting shows, a button appears on the Spotify page allowing you to sign into the podcast network and unlock the episodes. It’s all done from within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O2BLM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify wants to be the place you hear all your podcasts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IoN073"&gt;Notably, Patreon wasn’t on the list of initial partners and isn’t on this updated list, either, which is a glaring omission given that it’s one of the most popular ways podcasters build a subscriber base. Memberful is owned by Patreon, but that doesn’t mean Patreon-based creators will be able to distribute their shows through Spotify. (Memberful focuses more on building subscription software on podcasters’ own websites.) Also missing is Substack, which has also been aiming to bring podcasters to its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h06t4Q"&gt;Still, the idea that listeners can finally bring the shows they pay for into the Spotify app is a major one. Up until now, show subscribers have only been able to play content in apps that support private RSS feeds, which Spotify does not. The platform doesn’t rely on RSS feeds for its own exclusive shows, either, effectively locking them down to the platform. But if it wants to be the biggest podcast listening platform in the world, it needs to be the place people go for everything they want to hear — including their paid shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbmnBa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a teen punk led a movement for disabled people online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZE6Pedl3z8GUC013jOLKfLUqLTM=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638003/VRG_4679_Cripplepunk_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From Tumblr to TikTok, young disabled people are deciding how to represent themselves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ZzXPh7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XFMiuD"&gt;When Tyler Trewhella opened Tumblr in 2014 and &lt;a href="https://crpl-pnk.tumblr.com/post/104289031644/im-starting-a-movement"&gt;posted a photo&lt;/a&gt; of themself outside a diner, they had no idea that image would become their legacy. The photo shows them with cane in hand and cigarette in mouth, clad in boots, a denim jacket with pins, and a hat with earflaps. A small banner across the picture was originally going to say “diner punk,” but they decided at the last second to change it to “cripple punk.” Tongue in cheek, they captioned the post, “i’m starting a movement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="th3Pam"&gt;The post attracted a flood of hate mail, saying that disability isn’t something to be proud of, that disabled people shouldn’t smoke, or that a movement that “leaves out healthy people’’ isn’t punk. Trewhella took screenshots of the messages and added them to the post, writing, “This is why we need cripple punk.” Other people with disabilities started reblogging the post to add their own selfies, and tagging posts with cripple punk. To Trewhella’s surprise, a movement was born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3JONX"&gt;Realizing they were the leader of this new movement, Trewhella slapped together some &lt;a href="https://crpl-pnk.tumblr.com/post/104872173804/what-are-the-principles-of-cripple-punk-are-there"&gt;rules and principles&lt;/a&gt;. “Cripple punk is exclusively by the physically disabled for the physically disabled,” they wrote. “Cripple punk rejects the ‘good cripple’ mythos. Cripple punk is here for the bitter cripple, the uninspirational cripple, the smoking cripple, the drinking cripple, the addict cripple, the cripple who hasn’t ‘tried everything’ […] Cripple punk does not pander to the able bodied.” Unlike the common inspirational depictions of disability, cripple punk allowed disabled people to be bitter, messy, and honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The post on Trewhella’s blog that launched cripple punk." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Gn1GX3Ir-IqSasprFcQIUQ8hOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727311/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_6.17.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The post on Trewhella’s blog that launched cripple punk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNyjQV"&gt;Cripple punk grew into not just a movement, but a community. The tag flourished as people with disabilities celebrated each other, shared art, discussed feelings of shame, told stories of their experiences with ableism, and swapped tips about medications and mobility aids. The ask box of Trewhella’s blog became a public forum where people cracked jokes just as often as they sought guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq62He"&gt;Trewhella died in 2017, a devastating loss both for self-identified cripple punks and for the wider disability community. But the legacy of the movement is still alive, not just in the fact that some people still proudly wear the cripple punk name, but in the ways that people with disabilities have continued to talk about themselves online in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eISDlH"&gt;Emily Flores was an active Tumblr user in her early teens, just beginning to seek out a community of her own. She remembers encountering cripple punk for the first time, and she still has screenshots of some of the posts on her phone. “When I saw it, and just how unapologetic and just how simply badass it really was, it was really impactful for me,” she says. In 2018, when Flores was 15 years old and tired of seeing people like herself written about by non-disabled adults, she founded &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cripple Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an outlet for young disabled people to write from their own perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lY2AQr"&gt;The site publishes a range of cultural commentary, personal essays, interviews, and lifestyle tips. Recent stories include reflections on &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com/the-bruises-on-your-legs-shouldnt-matter-how-disability-and-body-image-intertwine/"&gt;disability and body image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com/rioters-at-the-capitol-insurrection-got-better-police-treatment-than-disabled-protestors-disability-activists-say/"&gt;ableism and police brutality&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com/disabled-influencers-are-rewriting-narratives-about-disability-on-social-media/"&gt;the rise of disabled influencers&lt;/a&gt;. The writers are in their teens or early twenties, and their ideas are often nuanced and well researched, whether they’re covering &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com/accessible-adventures-in-ttrpgs-with-sara-thompson/"&gt;combat wheelchairs in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://cripplemedia.com/biden-says-he-wants-his-cabinet-to-look-like-america-but-hasnt-nominated-any-disabled-people/"&gt;lack of cabinet members with disabilities&lt;/a&gt; in Biden’s administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QDKxx0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everything suddenly made sense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMIzef"&gt;Before finding cripple punk, Flores often felt a complex range of emotions that she couldn’t quite understand. She was irritated at being dragged to muscular dystrophy events where adults would tell her how brave she was. “I didn’t know why I couldn’t just be happy and feel grateful,” she says. She had no friends when she started high school, and sensed that every interaction she had with other people was moved by pity. She felt like her caregivers, rather than herself, were the main characters in her life. When she read about cripple punk, “Everything suddenly made sense,” she says, “every emotion that I had felt when I was younger made sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BP5ZW0"&gt;“That was when I started to identify myself as disabled,” Flores says, “and that was when I started to feel actual pride about my disability and started to feel proud about my community.” She had never posted a photo of herself with her wheelchair, and now she was seeing pictures not just of people in wheelchairs, but of people in wheelchairs who had the freedom to represent themselves however they wanted. Suddenly she could see her own future, one she had struggled to imagine because she’d so rarely seen authentic portrayals of people with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neeyzO"&gt;Cripple punk emerged as a natural outgrowth of decades of disability advocacy and activism. The ethos of cripple punk is familiar for anyone who’s followed the history of disability rights movements or has encountered the work of crip theorists. But rather than being relegated to the pages of textbooks, the cripple punk philosophy reached young people like Flores in a familiar setting with language that was easy to grasp. For a number of disabled young people who spent much of their time online, accounts like Trewhella’s were a gateway to learning the legacies of disability activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2lf2y"&gt;Erin Novakowski, another member of the &lt;em&gt;Cripple Media&lt;/em&gt; team, also remembers how disabled people on social media changed the way she thought about herself and her life. As a wheelchair user, she didn’t think she could ever wear formfitting clothes or skirts. When she started seeing photos of people with disabilities wearing all kinds of outfits, she realized she didn’t have to be stuck with the oversized sweatshirts she had limited herself to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt7b3B"&gt;Just as Flores and Novakowski have been affected by the visibility of disabled people on social media, they pay it forward to others at &lt;em&gt;Cripple Media&lt;/em&gt; and across the internet. Novakowski has about half a million followers &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheelierin?lang=en"&gt;on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, where she started out making wheelchair jokes and then expanded into posting whatever she wants. “You get to see a 19-year-old who uses a wheelchair and she’s just living her life and doing silly little 19-year-old things. I think that that’s really beneficial,” she says. “I also get to just absolutely destroy ableists, which does bring me great joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zTFsb3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are in control of what we are showing and what we’re sharing with the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBUNf3"&gt;Novakowski has grown to embrace the cripple punk principle of not pandering to non-disabled people. As she’s spent more time on TikTok, she’s realized she doesn’t owe anything to people who say abusive things to her about her disability. “When I look back at posts that I was making when I was younger, I would always make sure I was very kind, very respectful,” she says. Now she relishes responding to ableist comments on her videos. She occasionally uses them as teachable moments. Other times, she simply responds along the lines of “I fucked your mom, you suck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFHi1r"&gt;“It’s hard for us to delve into film or fashion or mainstream media and have ourselves portrayed the way that we actually want to be portrayed,” says Novakowski. “With social media, we are in control of what we are showing and what we’re sharing with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHL8QN"&gt;Lauren Melissa, one of the non-teen editors at &lt;em&gt;Cripple Media&lt;/em&gt;, knows it’s important for young people to have these opportunities to represent themselves. “There’s this message given, especially to young disabled individuals, that they don’t meet expectations, and that the only way to meet those expectations is to do exactly what other people tell them to do,” she says. “By giving them these spaces, we are really setting up teens to advocate for themselves, and also to live self-determining lives later on, instead of just learning from adults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvFuHa"&gt;The internet has provided more accessible opportunities for advocacy and activism, from disability-focused blogs that came long before cripple punk to tags like &lt;a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/crip-the-vote-hashtag-persons-with-disabilities-election-campaign"&gt;#CripTheVote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/highriskcovid-on-twitter-spotlights-average-people-at-risk#The-risk-of-those-who-are-immunosuppressed"&gt;#HighRiskCovid19&lt;/a&gt;. “We might not always be able to leave the home for a whole variety of reasons, but that doesn’t mean that our experiences are less valid or the rights that we deserve are less important,” says Melissa. “It’s very exciting to see the kind of work that disabled individuals can do online in order to create awareness, acceptance, visibility, and to fight for disability justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FkpvCt"&gt;The year before Trewhella died, I asked them to define cripple punk. “I think it is whatever the individual cripple punk is getting out of it,” they said. They told me it wasn’t any one thing. It was a backlash against ableist society, a push for self-acceptance, a countercultural movement, a family — and sometimes a fashion show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkBook 13S review: business on a budget</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A solid, affordable business notebook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dJ1cWy"&gt;Priced a tier below Lenovo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;world-class ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt;, the ThinkBook 13S targets small- and medium-sized companies and business users looking for a less snazzy device at a lower cost. But the ThinkBook’s price tag shouldn’t fool you — it’s a contender. And I’m impressed by the package the ThinkBook offers for its sub-$1,000 price, which includes solid performance from Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a high-resolution 16:10 screen, and surprisingly good audio. For everyday work use, it more than gets the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQGQ2O"&gt;The 13S &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkbook-series%2FThinkBook-13s-Gen-2-Intel%2Fp%2FXXTBXTSI300%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594739%2Flenovo-thinkbook-13s-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technically starts at $1,339&lt;/a&gt;, but Lenovo’s MSRPs are always inflated, and you can actually buy the base model &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-ThinkBook-13-3-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-i5-1135G7-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Pro-Mineral-Gray-20V9001RUS%2F851156296%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_wzXVOOX5XxyLUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBUgtQgsVHmRQ0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_159047%26clickid%3DwzXVOOX5XxyLUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBUgtQgsVHmRQ0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D568844%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now for a much more reasonable $738.81. That configuration includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), 256GB of storage, and a non-touch display. The top model is listed at $1,709 (but currently sold out on Lenovo’s website) and includes a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s keyboard seen from above on a white-tile countertop. The screen displays a night mountain scene with a red tent in the center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P32ve49w7Tu3D-4iwCMvA8decAg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735696/mchin_191016_4677_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, a six-row “spill resistant” keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayMom0"&gt;The in-between SKU I was sent isn’t actually listed on Lenovo’s website, but it includes the Core i5, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a touchscreen. As of this writing, it’s listed at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkBook-20V9001SUS-Touchscreen-Notebook/dp/B08SMQHBM2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$829.35 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. All models have a 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 display, a 720p webcam, and Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y9dZvx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10670383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="20HrsE"&gt;The main thing to know is: don’t buy this expecting a ThinkPad. The ThinkBook looks quite different, with a silvery-gray keyboard deck, a gray ThinkBook logo, and a dual-tone lid somewhat reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google’s Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;. It also lacks many of the ThinkPad’s famous features like the discrete mouse clickers, TrackPoint nub, and unique keyboard layout. That said, it also didn’t pick up a ton of fingerprints (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22351156/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;a gripe I sometimes have with ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s quite portable at 0.59 inches thick and 2.78 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMzfxC"&gt;The keyboard also isn’t a ThinkPad keyboard — which is unfortunate because ThinkPad keyboards are consistently my favorites. The ThinkBook’s is still fine, but it doesn’t have dedicated Page Up and Page Down keys or inverted-T arrow keys like most modern ThinkPads do. It’s also a bit flat for my taste, though it has a nice click. The touchpad is similarly functional, but the texture is a bit coarse and took some getting used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Lenovo ThinkBook 13s." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMOiOyILwqtBdJOHrcyT8-plWoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735697/mchin_191016_4677_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish there was a microSD slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oiO60i"&gt;Two things do stand out about the ThinkBook 13S. It has the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; beat with its port selection, which includes two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, a Kensington lock slot, one USB 4 Type-C with Thunderbolt 4, one HDMI 2.0, and one combination audio jack. (The included 65W charger will occupy the USB-C port when the ThinkBook is plugged in, so I do wish there were one more.) Second, I was surprised by how good the audio was. I could actually hear the bass from the 2W stereo speakers, and my music was loud and clear overall. There was a tiny amount of distortion and echo at maximum volume, which bumping the sound down a bit eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfem0t"&gt;Elsewhere, the display is sharp but on the dim side, maxing out at just 244 nits in our testing. This is okay for indoor use, but it wouldn’t be great for anywhere particularly bright (and especially not outdoors). And it’s dimmer than some competitors; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13&lt;/a&gt; gets up to 368 nits, while the XPS 13 can break 400. I do appreciate that it’s 16:10, giving you some extra vertical space compared to the 16:9 panels you’ll often see on 13-inch laptops. It’s also 2560 x 1600, and $829 is an excellent price for that resolution. The webcam delivers an accurate but somewhat grainy picture and isn’t compatible with Windows Hello. If you do want to use that service, there’s a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that’s quite fast and never gave me trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INWIoW"&gt;That’s pretty much the exterior of the 13S. It’s unexciting but dependable, and it will certainly get the job done. That’s true of the insides as well. The ThinkBook is a solid performer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s open on a white-tiled counter, seen from the front. The screen displays a night mountain scene with a bright tent in the center and a Lenovo banner on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmHoQ807-IYb_3XJ26guzfymIAk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735698/mchin_191016_4677_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The body has an “anodized sandblasted finish.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BEBCdW"&gt;This ThinkBook is Intel Evo certified, which means it meets Intel’s various requirements to be a top competitor, including instant wake, fast charging, and responsive performance. The Core i5-1135G7 was largely fine in my day-to-day tasks. I saw a bit of a slowdown when I was pushing a highly demanding workflow — including multiple downloads running, files copying, around a dozen Chrome tabs, and some photo editing on top — but anything less than that was snappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s seen from the front on a white-tiled countertop. The screen displays a night mountain scene with a bright tent in the center and a Lenovo banner on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aI2sJAmJJUPe4fzI_ZqlThuhbPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735693/mchin_191016_4677_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose between “Extreme Performance,” “Intelligent Cooling,” and “Battery Saving” power profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="67ty8B"&gt;The ThinkBook also proved competent in content-creation workflows, though not a standout. It got a 265 on the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which tests both live playback and export performance at 4K and 8K. That actually beats the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with a more powerful Core i7-1165G7 on that benchmark. It also beats the ZenBook 13 OLED with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, though it doesn’t come close to touching the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=49199"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this device did much better on heavy graphics work than I’d expect from a machine at this price range. (I wasn’t able to run our real-world media export on this device because Premiere kept crashing in the middle of it — that could be Lenovo’s or Adobe’s fault.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbQYr8"&gt;This device wouldn’t be the best choice for video professionals, of course, but those results underscore how good of a deal this device is. Despite costing a few hundred bucks less than the XPSes and ZenBooks out there with similar specs, it’s holding its own on the benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="Jjcccn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10670402"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T82aNN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Rocket League’&lt;/em&gt; was smooth and looked great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrYJwJ"&gt;This laptop also isn’t meant for frequent gaming (few laptops this size are), but it can certainly run more casual and browser-based fare. It averaged 35fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League’s &lt;/em&gt;maximum settings at native resolution and 52fps at 1080p. Neither of those hit the magic 60 mark (the ZenBook 13 OLED and the XPS 13 both did), but I absolutely would have played the game at both settings — it was smooth and looked great. The ThinkBook also averaged 168fps on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; at native and 179fps at 1080p, which also loses to the ZenBook as well as the XPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RS6It"&gt;That said, the difference on lighter games doesn’t matter as the ThinkBook’s 60Hz screen will only show you 60fps. And the ThinkBook actually did better, comparatively on heavier titles. It averaged 57fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra settings at 1080p (to the XPS’s 48 and the ZenBook’s 54). And while it chugged through &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;(lowest settings, native) at just 22fps, it achieved a more impressive 34fps at 1080p, which is closer to the MacBook Air (38fps) than it is to the XPS (22fps), and it also beats the ZenBook (30fps). Overall, these results are mixed, but the ThinkBook is certainly holding its own among more expensive and higher-specced Windows competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s on a white-tile countertop seen from the back, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgH5yD-4K-MzWVCCZPQCPph2Dyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735699/mchin_191016_4677_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the battery can charge up to 80 percent in an hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBVKbr"&gt;On battery life, though, not so much. I got seven hours and 12 minutes using the ThinkBook 13S as my primary work driver with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not a disaster and means you could get close to a full workday out of this device without needing to plug it in. But this is an area where we expect more from premium competitors. The XPS and the Air both averaged over eight hours in our testing, and the AMD-powered ZenBook 13 (which is powering an OLED screen) broke 11 hours with my workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wIgd3M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10670411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fW2tA"&gt;Things also got toasty. The center of the keyboard was so hot during my gaming runs that it was slightly uncomfortable to touch, and the bottom of the chassis was also blistering enough under heavy workloads that I couldn’t use the ThinkBook on my lap. The fans got quite loud during some of these periods — to the point where I ended up restarting the computer a few times to get them to quiet down. (They were quiet most of the time if I was just working in a few tabs.) The CPU did stay fairly cool. I saw one spike up to 94 degrees (Celsius) during my &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; run, but things otherwise stayed below the mid-70s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWVdEC"&gt;Overall, though, the best thing about the ThinkBook 13S is that it’s a good deal. Business buyers looking for ThinkPad-level performance and software without ThinkPad pricing will probably find the ThinkBook a solid option. While nothing about it is really spectacular, it’s certainly unusual to see the ThinkBook’s screen resolution at a sub-$1,000 price, and its performance will be more than adequate for most office tasks. The generous port selection, 16:10 aspect ratio, physical webcam shutter, and clear audio are certainly icing on the cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOiCGq"&gt;There are areas where the cracks show, of course. Battery life is underwhelming for the category, and the screen’s brightness is disappointing. You do get advantages, particularly when it comes to look and build quality, from ultraportables that are $200–$300 more. But there are certainly customers — especially in the business sphere, I imagine — who care more about having a portable, affordable device with decent connectivity than they do about having one that’s beautiful. For those people, this should be a fine choice. &lt;/p&gt;
