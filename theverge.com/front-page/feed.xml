    <title>Roast your own Spotify listens with this snarky AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdXN5hc2dG3WoIKkFKxPL3vS7mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569959/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9pJGW"&gt;The yearly Spotify Wrapped is a rather upbeat affair, which doesn’t doesn’t quite match everyone’s mood this year. For the more sullen among us, there’s another option: &lt;a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/"&gt;a bot from The Pudding&lt;/a&gt; that will judge us for our crimes of listening to terrible music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWfXOF"&gt;If you want to be judged, you open a page titled “How Bad is Your Spotify” and you log in with your Spotify account. (It might take a couple refreshes on the “Loading your music library” page.) This absolute jerk of an AI then drags you mercilessly while it pulls your playlists and top tracks. It asks you questions before it shows any results, in phrasing that gives the plain text the same aura as the girls who bullied me in middle school. &lt;em&gt;Did you really listen to Clementine by Sarah Jaffe?&lt;/em&gt; (Yes) &lt;em&gt;Like ironically?&lt;/em&gt; (No…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ukO8"&gt;The final judgement comes in the form of a multi-hyphenated phrase, followed by a page of loose statistics (I am apparently 24 percent basic). This stupid little computer program deemed my Spotify listens mason-jar-candle-from-target-craft-beer-snob-wet-ass bad. And you know what? It’s right. I listened to a frankly unholy amount of Hozier this year. Spotify Wrapped wanted me to be proud of that, but I’ve spent the year hating the fact that I was too bummed out and busy to actually seek out new and exciting artists. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0BDwdm_jXA_TxOLYNU615qD808=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22191874/IMG_2712.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RNGZB"&gt;The bot is not actually that personalized. It will ask everyone the same boilerplate questions in a snarky tone. But it still gave me the validation I didn’t know I craved. My music taste kinda sucks, but whose doesn’t? Who among us doesn’t love to listen to the same old tried-and-true songs that hit just right, even if they earn the scorn of our more pretentious friends? Please join me in this journey of shameless shamefulness, and find some joy in a well-earned roast.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC says third-largest cryptocurrency was sold all wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYTrTHQ5OR_09PmtitMZ_W3seOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569791/acastro_1901001_3701_indieGameDevs_still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vp9aWN"&gt;Ripple, its former CEO and founder Christian Larsen, and its current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse are being &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XfLHO"&gt;The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ2a72"&gt;At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: &lt;a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/b1m2pm9g4n65mk/cryptocurrencies-and-us-securities-laws-beyond-bitcoin-and-ether"&gt;is it a security or a currency&lt;/a&gt;? According to the SEC’s suit, it’s a security, and so Ripple didn’t provide its investors with the proper information they needed to assess any potential risk. According to Garlinghouse, it’s a virtual currency, which means the SEC has nothing to do with it. The SEC has previously ruled that bitcoin and Ethereum are currencies. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ripple-labs-inc-resolves-criminal-investigation"&gt;the Justice Department treated XRP&lt;/a&gt; as a currency in 2015, when Ripple settled a suit over its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emoJ9F"&gt;But XRP differs from bitcoin and Ethereum in an important way. For those two cryptocurrencies, new coins are created through a “mining” process, which is ongoing. Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PiCIuc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I appreciate you saying what this could mean for the larger U.S. crypto industry. The SEC is doing the opposite of “fostering innovation” here in the US.  It’s not just XRP they’re attacking here. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b"&gt;https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1341405037948493826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THcfd6"&gt;The SEC has won similar suits against Block.one and Kik in the past, saying that the initial coin offerings these startups offered were actually securities. But those cases were different; Kik and Block.one did their ICOs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; an SEC directive in 2017. XRP came into existence years before that directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HugUQ"&gt;The lawsuit didn’t come as a surprise; Garlinghouse &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-to-sue-ripple-over-xrp-sales-ceo-says"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that the company expected the suit, and Ripple has already published its &lt;a href="https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ripple-Wells-Submission-Summary.pdf"&gt;Wells response&lt;/a&gt;, a document that explains to the SEC that its actions were legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD3fP3"&gt;An important part of settling whether XRP is a currency or a security may involve something called the Howey test, which was created by a 1946 Supreme Court case. That ruling defined a security as an investment of money in a shared enterprise with an expectation of profits from others’ work. According to Ripple, XRP doesn’t satisfy the Howey test for a variety of reasons, but especially because no one bought XRP with the expectation of getting Ripple’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Xnh1"&gt;The SEC’s complaint challenges that. In 2016, Ripple admitted to the New York State Department of Financial Services that buyers were “purchasing XRP for speculative purposes.” It also cites a hedge fund investor who owned XRP saying in 2015 that “the increase in XRP value is heavily dependent on the success of Ripple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2zZ6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack says readers and writers are really in charge of moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h-ISkZBHEPqPMJ0eq14-4UgNwo=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569677/Untitled_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCZC4j"&gt;Substack plans to take a “hands-off approach” to determining who can use its newsletter platform and “resist public pressure” to remove writers seen by some as “unacceptable.” &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"&gt;In a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, the company outlined a relatively lax content moderation policy designed to let writers know they won’t be removed from the platform as long as they comply with basic rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgKGu3"&gt;While it does have &lt;a href="https://substack.com/content"&gt;a short list of prohibitions&lt;/a&gt;, Substack says that “readers and writers are in charge.” The idea is that readers don’t have to pay for or subscribe to writers who they don’t agree with, and writers can leave — and take their mailing lists with them — if they don’t like the platform. “We just disagree with those who would seek to tightly constrain the bounds of acceptable discourse,” the platform’s co-founders wrote today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1MhA5"&gt;Substack argues that it’s nothing like Facebook or Twitter, but it could soon have to grapple with the same thorny moderation problems of big platforms. The service has attracted a number of high profile writers this year, including Glenn Greenwald and Anne Helen Petersen. Pretty much anyone can start a newsletter and start accepting payments on the platform, though, and the service’s increasing prominence could soon lead to an influx of writers who aren’t reviewed or endorsed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7t0NvE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Substack CEO Chris Best build a new model for journalism?  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FqsRQp"&gt;Substack’s approach echoes Reddit’s longtime policies around moderation, which the service has only recently started to change. The platform long held itself up to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17226416/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-racism-racist-slurs-are-okay"&gt;a bastion of free speech&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to subscribe to the communities that interested them and ignore ones they didn’t. That led to some troubling groups — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9103393/reddit-content-policy-official"&gt;like a white supremacist community&lt;/a&gt; — to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA1Weh"&gt;Moderation at Substack is currently handled by the site’s founders, Substack CEO Chris Best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;said earlier this month on &lt;em&gt;Decoder &lt;/em&gt;with Nilay Patel.&lt;/a&gt; “In general, we’re very pro-freedom of the press and extending that freedom to as many writers as possible,” Best said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony says it’s already seeing some benefits from WarnerMedia’s big HBO Max bet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqCu0jOOUkgkLjoXQjSBP9XV9bI=/589x0:1876x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569501/Spider_Swing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wvj9gD"&gt;Sony Pictures saw a “bit of a boom” in interest from Hollywood creatives who want to work with a studio committed to theatrical releases, according to the company’s CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbyp2b"&gt;The uptick in interest comes just after WarnerMedia announced its 17 movies planned for 2021 will premiere on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;. For WarnerMedia executives trying to figure out how to bolster subscribers for its new streaming service and release films in an era when the return to theaters is uncertain, the move makes sense. Plus, WarnerMedia executives will tell you they’re still committed to theatrical releases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-warnermedia-studios-and-networks-group-chairman-ceo-ann-sarnoff-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-alley-today-.html"&gt;pointing to &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s release&lt;/a&gt;. Others in the industry will point to &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;as a reason &lt;em&gt;for &lt;/em&gt;the HBO Max move. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rESR5i"&gt;While Sony could &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/studio-dilemma-risk-a-box-office-flop-sell-netflix-1246354"&gt;sell a title to a streamer&lt;/a&gt; — the company sold Tom Hanks’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greyhound &lt;/em&gt;to Apple&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for $70 million — CEO Tony Vinciquerra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkAlley/status/1341458110221836288"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the company remains committed to more traditional releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtmjUV"&gt;“The real benefit has been the number of incoming calls from talent to us saying, ‘We want to be doing business with you because we know you’re a theatrical distributor and producer,’” Vinciquerra said. “That has actually worked very well for us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiRqna"&gt;One important reason Vinciquerra can commit to theaters is because Sony Pictures doesn’t have a major streaming service. Therefore, its blockbusters will continue as theatrical exclusives before moving to other platforms (digital retailers and cable). There are some advantages Sony is finding within the industry’s shifting moment. Executives want a more flexible release period, ideally looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184030/universal-trolls-world-tour-hunt-coronavirus-birds-of-prey-warner-bros-disney-paramount-vod-digital"&gt;30-day exclusivity in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, most movies play in theaters for up to 90 days exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iXBknq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That has actually worked very well for us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THyKT7"&gt;Like other CEOs, Vinciquerra wants the option to keep a movie in theaters for a shorter period of time if it’s not performing as well, while also keeping high grossing movies (think &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;) in theaters for as long as possible. Unlike other executives at companies like Disney and WarnerMedia, however, Vinciquerra also doesn’t have to worry about growing a streaming service (Sony instead sees big financial return in licensing after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/flush-with-cash-streaming-giants-prep-mega-bids-for-hollywood-hits?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;movies hit the home market&lt;/a&gt;), giving Sony room to be the studio that &lt;em&gt;actually can&lt;/em&gt; commit to keeping its films in theaters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJRCvi"&gt;With WarnerMedia offering people in the US the option to stream at home, and Disney moving some of its titles to Disney Plus exclusively, Sony has more room on the calendar to figure out where to drop its smaller number of blockbusters to generate the most revenue. Having more freedom within the calendar is especially key in 2021 when there is, currently, a blockbuster scheduled practically every week. Trying to find an emptier weekend to debut a movie — one that might have space to find an audience for weeks — becomes a little easier, and could help with contract negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTWXC9"&gt;“When we dated [&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt;], I knew a year in advance, because it was the second week of &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;, that absolutely positively [&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;] would not open at number one,” Tom Rothman, Sony Pictures Chairman, told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-reporter-executive-roundtable-7-major-studio-chiefs-1250718"&gt;in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “And the conversation we had with the filmmakers was, ‘Even if we get your biggest opening ever, I promise you will not be number one. But I also promise you it’s a great day for the movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eadIhq"&gt;None of this means Sony is suddenly going to become the biggest studio in the world, or the only place directors want to work. As distribution methods change, so do contracts. When the world does enter a post-pandemic phase, and people venture out to watch movies, Disney and Warner Bros. will likely rule the box office once again. In 2019, Disney amassed &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/highest-grossing-movie-studios-2019-record-international-global-box-office-market-share-chart-analysis-2020-forecast-1202823471/"&gt;$13.15 billion at the global box office&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for more than 50 percent of the marketshare. Warner Bros. came in second with $4.4 billion, and Sony trailed with $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bzTt35"&gt;&lt;q&gt;None of this means Sony is going to become the biggest studio in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paqN4U"&gt;What Sony’s commitment does mean, however, is the studio has a massive advantage with filmmakers like Christopher Nolan and &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;director Denis Villeneuve, both of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;publicly decried WarnerMedia’s move&lt;/a&gt;. Disney, WarnerMedia and, to an extent, NBCUniversal have to consider their costly and shiny streaming platforms in need of constant new content, while Sony does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsS1du"&gt;Netflix has dipped its toe into theatrical releases (especially for awards consideration), but its primary audience is at home. Amazon Studios has stepped &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-studios-jen-salke-on-film-strategy-late-night-honey-boy/"&gt;back from theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt; in order to focus on Amazon Prime subscribers. Apple remains a question mark: would the trillion dollar company commit to a 40-day theatrical window if it meant working with top talent, before moving titles to its Apple TV+ platform? Seems like a definite possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk3H3q"&gt;Sony is betting on theaters, and talent, to drive its business. That’s not new, but as other companies focus on streaming, it does feel especially notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECy77Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZFpj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjJlca"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKaUdj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGWK7W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A OnePlus smartwatch is finally coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gco3Ay"&gt;OnePlus will finally be making a smartwatch in 2021, CEO Pete Lau has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first foray into wearable devices for the smartphone company. There’s not many details yet on the upcoming device,  including what smartwatch OS it’ll run, a price, or even a firm release date — Lau only notes that it’ll be “released early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKQ2Uj"&gt;The idea of a OnePlus smartwatch isn’t a new one; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/4/11859138/oneplus-canceled-smartwatch"&gt;had reportedly designed&lt;/a&gt; a Wear OS (then still called Android Wear) smartwatch a few years ago. OnePlus ultimately nixed that product, though” “We had completed the design but we still decided to scrap it,” Lau said in &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-smaller-smartphone-makers-feel-the-markets-squeeze-1464947768?mod=e2twd"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We have to be focused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Awm2nv"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many of you said you wanted a watch, and as you might have heard over the weekend—we're making one, to be released early next year. Wishes do come true.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/H1Fqv9srXj"&gt;https://t.co/H1Fqv9srXj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4oc1s"&gt;OnePlus has started to branch out beyond phones in recent years, though: in addition to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"&gt;high-end smartphone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;lineup each year&lt;/a&gt;, the company now makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219689/oneplus-bullets-wireless-z-earbuds-headphones-price"&gt;an array of headphones&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;budget line of Nord phones&lt;/a&gt;, and even smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGzzZT"&gt;The launch of a OnePlus smartwatch in 2021 — the first from the company — also comes hot on the heels of the release of the Oppo Watch earlier this year, which was similar the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167560/oppo-watch-apple-china-price-release-date-smartwatch"&gt;first-ever smartwatch that Oppo had made&lt;/a&gt;. Given that there’s been no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;similarities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18678746/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review-oneplus-7-pro-camera"&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt; between Oppo and OnePlus products (the two companies share an owner, the massive conglomerate BBK Electronics), it’s possible that the upcoming OnePlus watch may take some cues from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"&gt;existing Oppo Watch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s nationwide 5G can be slower than its LTE network, tests show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ey6Zvi67ahwauofHpqKcjEfHho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569332/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoFTeg"&gt;Verizon’s new nationwide 5G network is reportedly slower than its LTE network, to the point that users are apparently better off just disabling 5G entirely unless they’re near a mmWave network. The results come from &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;testing done by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s Sascha Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, who points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS&lt;/a&gt;, as the culprit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8EPRy"&gt;The tech lets carriers run LTE and 5G networks side by side, which is useful if, like Verizon, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418981/verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-auction-winner-fcc-dish"&gt;don’t yet have enough dedicated 5G spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. While the carrier has largely focused on its mmWave network until recently, it also has begun rolling out a mid-band nationwide 5G network, which promises to avoid mmWave’s range issues by using DSS. The only catch is that, with Verizon, it seems like this tech leads to worse performance in most cases for phones running in 5G mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ggJFH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WWL2r"&gt;The solution, at least for now, is to just turn 5G off if you’re a Verizon customer. If that has your concerned about speeds compared to your T-Mobile customer friends, don’t worry too much: in it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;nationwide speed test&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found that T-Mobile’s 5G can often still be slower than Verizon’s LTE, even though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418289/t-mobile-mid-band-5g-81-new-cities-towns-coverage-gigabit-speeds"&gt;uses dedicated 5G bands&lt;/a&gt;. That same nationwide test also revealed that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G can be slower than its LTE as well — which makes sense, given that it also uses the DSS technology for it’s 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAZuIE"&gt;The results from &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; were only done in New York City, so if you have a 5G phone on Verizon, it may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on. If you’re not, it may be worth turning it off entirely for now. This is also likely just a temporary issue — as Verizon continues to add dedicated 5G spectrum, their speeds are going to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKURvA"&gt;It’s important to note that this doesn’t apply to Verizon’s mmWave technology, which is much faster than anything any other carrier has to offer. However, while mmWave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8G_4FocrA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;has the speed, it doesn’t have the range&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be blocked by trees, buildings, and sometimes even windows. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516518/apple-iphone-12-5g-uw-verizon-mmwave-logo-reveal-ad-chris-rock"&gt;if you often find that 5G UB logo&lt;/a&gt; popping up on your phone, and you need that speed, it may be worth keeping 5G on, even if it could lead to slow downs when you get outside its range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Nickelback really want you to look at your photographs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6sFS-uBcXdlkmt8A0K6Lmjh4Lg=/97x0:1252x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569309/Screen_Shot_2020_12_22_at_1.56.54_PM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="92b5r1"&gt;Nickelback has created &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km3sqKZ7CPE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;a parody version of its own song “Photograph”&lt;/a&gt; for a new Google Photos ad, and it’s a lot more entertaining than you might suspect. In the ad, Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger mercilessly makes fun of himself, fully leaning into the “Photograph” meme and its usefulness in explaining all sorts of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; and in illustrating &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NSUe_-3PIFk"&gt;framed copies of other memes&lt;/a&gt;, as Kroeger instructs viewers to “look at them” in his unmistakable, raspy voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtmEtU"&gt;The ad’s lyrics and photos touch on Kroeger’s “noodle hair” and his passion for photographing dessert. That it manages to both be a nice example of Google Photos’ features and a cute use of the old meme makes it worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVS0SG"&gt;“Photograph” is 15 years old, and the meme connected to it has been around for &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nickelbacks-photograph"&gt;at least five&lt;/a&gt;, so seeing the ad is bound to spark some memories, which is exactly Google’s intention. While it’s not quite an original idea for an ad, Google gets a pat on the head for being aware of the joke. Nickelback also wrote the new lyrics for the parody version, according to an email Google sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so the band’s having some fun too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FKbn0u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIlNIVXpIns?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MP8xDb"&gt;Viral videos cemented Nickelback’s status as a meme, but here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/15/8420611/kwame-opam-wont-stop-nickel-rolling-me-this-is-my-story"&gt;“Nickel-rolling”&lt;/a&gt; is what first comes to mind when we think of the band. Nickel-rolling is the unfortunate practice of trolling people with songs, lyrics, and images from the band Nickelback, like a Rickroll for the Nickelback generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgolOG"&gt;The band has been the butt of jokes in the past, but if I’m honest, “Photograph” is a catchy song — good luck getting it out of your head if you watch the whole Google Photos ad. I think a lot of the ironic hate towards Nickelback is fading — I know it is for me. When we discussed the new ad, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Nick Statt summed up the phenomenon well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sVfKxW"&gt;I feel like every thing the internet hates eventually becomes endearing, because the curve of internet culture bends toward “not being a jerk” as everyone just grows up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YCXNon"&gt;Whether someone at Google is admitting to being a Nickelback fan or simply reviving an old joke, some levity might be necessary given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;Google’s new storage policy in Photos&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced it will end its unlimited storage offer for “high quality” photos after June 1st, 2021. If you want to store more than 15GB after that cut-off, you’ll have to subscribe to Google One. Yes, Google would like you to look at your photographs, and it fully expects you to pay for the privilege of storing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s winter sale is live — here are the best games to get</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="fall guys" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wkrf15YJn8GqaYL3kz79NZGpwn0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569257/ss_b2b6b170330b8af1f50d0e90efad984adafeb281.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l9xbw9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/2904223191309839603"&gt;Steam’s annual winter sale&lt;/a&gt; is live. If you’ve been meaning to buy some games, either for yourself or as a gift for upcoming holidays, now’s the time to take a look around. There are thousands of games up for sale in the Steam Store (and you can vote for the 2020 Steam Awards while you’re there). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHt7T8"&gt;While you’re browsing, the Epic Games store is also in the midst of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale"&gt;holiday sale&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to discounts of up to 75 percent, the sale provides endless $10 coupons — that is, you can apply one to a purchase (on “eligible games” priced at $14.99 and up), apply another to your next purchase, and so on. And the store will be giving away games for free until December 31st. As of this writing, the current freebie is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/metro-2033-redux/home"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro: 2033 Redux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(usually $19.99).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Z62RjT"&gt;This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4"&gt;modernized remake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; is another &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2/home"&gt;deal to snag&lt;/a&gt;. Among other changes, the title brings new visuals and updated characters to the skateboarding classics. Chad Muska’s and Rodney Mullen’s characters are now middle-aged, for example, but you can also play as younger skaters like Aori Nishimura and Tyshawn Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gUyRAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScGyFZ"&gt;Below are a few other games that are worth checking out before Epic’s deals expire, in addition to the freebies that will rotate through the month. If you were disappointed by &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;and would rather play a finished CD Projekt Red game, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;is heavily discounted this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="84ymdz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/jackbox-party-pack-7/home"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackbox Party Pack 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is $22.49 (usually $29.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5csR71"&gt;

    <title>Congratulations, the US got you cryptocurrency regulation for Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGY8FUn9j5gyXjVbkb-arxt-aJ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569165/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IGn5ds"&gt;Under &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf"&gt;new proposed regulations&lt;/a&gt; from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, it may become much easier for the government to track bitcoin transactions. And while there’s currently a 15-day comment period open, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are calling foul because that period includes Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwevyj"&gt;The proposed regulations in question, which were filed at 4:20PM ET on December 18th, are about private wallets. Let’s say I am a famous and fancy cryptocurrency investor, and I do some trading on Coinbase. If I have my own private wallet that I want to transfer my money to, I will have to identify myself as the wallet’s owner if I’m sending more than $3,000 in a transaction. And if I want to do business with someone else who has a private wallet, I need to tell the exchange some pretty detailed personal information. The exchanges are then required to store records of all this and turn them over on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xYYQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This new know-your-customer requirement is&lt;em&gt;, at minimum&lt;/em&gt;, a complete pain in the ass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7cOzM"&gt;Also under the proposed regulation, an exchange would be required to report my personal information if I make a total of more than $10,000 in transactions in one day. You can see why Coinbase — or any other exchange — would see this new know-your-customer requirement&lt;em&gt;, at minimum&lt;/em&gt;, as a complete pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2bTnB"&gt;It’s also the most ironic development in cryptocurrency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;ironic history&lt;/a&gt;; born from a weird group of the &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179490/digital-cash"&gt;libertarians, anarchists, and utopians&lt;/a&gt;, cryptocurrency promised to be a way to transact absolutely privately, in &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"&gt;a trustless system&lt;/a&gt;. Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, arose just after the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to banks — but these new regulations will make cryptocurrency exchanges act a lot more like banks. Taken in concert with &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-proposes-kyc-rules-for-crypto-wallets"&gt;another rule change&lt;/a&gt; about international transactions, it may signal that cryptocurrency’s wild years are over — and anonymity will be harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmUsqn"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchanges make it easy to move from dollars (or whatever) into a cryptocurrency and vice versa. That also means that they make cryptocurrency accessible to more people. The current FinCEN proposal makes more work for these exchanges &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for the people operating within them as well as undermining the anonymity for which cryptocurrency is famous. Taken in combination with &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-fatf-travel-rule-threshold-v20-summit"&gt;another recent proposed rule change &lt;/a&gt;about how to report cryptocurrency that crosses borders, you can see why some cryptocurrency enthusiasts are nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QbsVmp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created to ensure anonymity, would ensure exactly the opposite under these rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSZsuM"&gt;There are some concrete consequences to this, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;the EFF points out&lt;/a&gt;. First, it makes anonymity more difficult in a transaction between a private wallet and one hosted by an exchange service. Second, the proposed legislation also makes it less appealing to have a private wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWyC63"&gt;But the third problem is the real kick in the ass: some cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, record all transactions publicly. That means if I am trading bitcoin into my private wallet from an exchange, I have to send a bunch of identifying information about that wallet, which is then potentially available to the US government. Because as soon as you know a specific wallet address is &lt;em&gt;mine,&lt;/em&gt; you know &lt;em&gt;every bitcoin transaction I have ever made with that wallet.&lt;/em&gt; This means “that the government may have access to a massive amount of data beyond just what the regulation purports to cover,” &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;the EFF writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luIj8v"&gt;So bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created to ensure anonymity, would &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-proposes-kyc-rules-for-crypto-wallets"&gt;ensure exactly the opposite&lt;/a&gt; under these rules. Though, I suppose, with a little creativity, it’s possible to get around them; you simply create a wallet for the know-your-customer rules, then transfer your money from there into a second private wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lgigs5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If this proposed bill passes, your withdrawals to your non-KYC'd address will take two transactions instead of one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before: Exchange -&amp;gt; Wallet Address&lt;br&gt;After: Exchange -&amp;gt; KYC Wallet Address -&amp;gt; Wallet Address&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meaningless? &lt;a href="https://t.co/vcXD31GyJe"&gt;https://t.co/vcXD31GyJe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Wall    (@ercwl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1340059610493972496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXK3uW"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbases-response-to-recent-proposed-rulemaking-from-the-u-s-treasury-and-fincen-109dd7477d31"&gt;Coinbase’s chief legal counsel, Paul Grewal, issued a response to FinCEN&lt;/a&gt;, complaining about the 15 day period for comments on this rule change: “FinCEN asked the public to provide comments in just 15 days, spanning Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day, in the middle of a global pandemic — leaving just a handful of actual working days for comments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYPsF9"&gt;Coinbase is asking for a 60 day review period — which is the norm. The shorter review period of just 15 days is because the Treasury Department says “significant national security imperatives” mean this has to move faster. It’s true that some cryptocurrency transactions are criminal — &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/"&gt;The Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; was a significant part of bitcoin’s history, after all. The proposed rule says that cryptocurrencies “facilitate international terrorist financing, weapons proliferation, sanctions evasion, and transnational money laundering,” among its laundry list of potential criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvCvDT"&gt;But it’s hard to know how serious that is, since 60 days from now, cryptocurrency exchanges would be dealing with the Biden administration rather than the outgoing Trump administration. “There is no emergency here; there is only an outgoing administration attempting to bypass the required consultation with the public to finalize a rushed rule before their time in office is done,” Grewal wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucIFmd"&gt;Regardless of the 15-day or 60-day period, it does seem like the Treasury Department is attempting to send a message to any would-be cypherpunks: you can’t beat the existing financial world — you can only join it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRP2dW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New York Times’ crossword can now haunt your living room in augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A solved mini New York Times crossword overlaid on my couch, with a banner that says “Congrats! You solved the puzzle!” " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_p2lAuxKF5oT7D1Vy9eeSMO5M_w=/0x128:750x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568928/NYTimes_Shattered_Crossword.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;I’ve done it.  | New York Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBHXNe"&gt;A miniature &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; crossword can now float above your couch, courtesy of an augmented reality effect available on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/nytimes/"&gt;Instagram page&lt;/a&gt;. Pull up the effect on your phone, and a prompt will appear saying, “The crossword has shattered into pieces!” A small crossword sits on whatever surface you’ve picked, while a cloud of letter shards hovers above it. As you move your camera around, the change in perspective will reveal the words that solve the puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEJ1Xw"&gt;It uses the same principle of perspective, anamorphosis, that some artists play with to make  work that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E-IXJkwics0"&gt;creates an optical illusion&lt;/a&gt; when viewed from a specific vantage point. It’s a neat concept, but it’s not exactly the same as actually solving a crossword. Fiddling with your phone camera doesn’t require quite as much intellectual rigor as the Sunday puzzle, but taking a guess at the word you need can help you hunt for the right shapes in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTDe0E"&gt;The game is either fun or frustrating, depending on your tolerance for gimmicks. Some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff found it too finicky for their tastes. I, however, am a simple person of simple pleasures, and I derive satisfaction from watching little pieces click together and fall onto the crossword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qAbp19"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;please enjoy this clip of me desperately trying to find the right angle to arrange four letters &lt;a href="https://t.co/aQ7EMqjeDK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aQ7EMqjeDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— crisp distancing  (@crisp_red) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crisp_red/status/1341483320086020096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFbror"&gt;It’s a gimmick that seems to hope the puzzler will be impressed with AR — which may not be the case for most crossword fans. But it did manage to pull me off the couch for a full minute (much to the confusion of my dog) while I tried to get the scattered fragments of the word “acts” to fall into place. You don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; physically circle around — you can use two fingers to rotate the little cloud of shards and zoom in or out — but these days, I’ll use any excuse to stretch my legs. &lt;/p&gt;
