  &lt;p id="3SKzU1"&gt;If you have been having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;a hard time&lt;/a&gt; trying to find &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X/S&lt;/a&gt; consoles in stock, you have another chance to get your hands on one or both of these next-gen consoles. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the consoles available for purchase today at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4on9Q"&gt;Like past restocks, Walmart is selling these next-gen consoles exclusively online through its official website as well as through the Walmart mobile app. It’s unknown when Walmart plans to sell these consoles again in stores, so if you want to buy either console currently, online is the only available method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkD512"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles today, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model you buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1U3tvW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snydbQ"&gt;Due to the popularity of these next-gen consoles, we anticipate that they will sell out &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;quickly. So if you plan to buy this console either for yourself or a loved one, don’t hesitate to click the purchase button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPzI7P"&gt;Both consoles have been out of stock for almost three months and demand for both has been through the roof. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263821/sony-earnings-q3-2020-ps5-launch-sales"&gt;Sony reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that it sold 4.5 million PS5 consoles last year alone following the November 12th launch. Last week, Microsoft, while not releasing specific numbers in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, noted that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats call on FCC to expand remote learning connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8cPp9BWMmgvZ3QKnhlv84_bhE0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769547/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agYGqG"&gt;In an open letter on Thursday, dozens of Democrats called on Federal Communications Commission Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;to expand the use of broadband funds&lt;/a&gt; for students struggling to stay connected and participate in remote learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpCJi4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;In a letter to Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt;, signed by over 30 Senate Democrats, including Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA), they requested that the FCC use E-Rate program funds to connect students with devices and home internet access who are currently unable to participate in online learning as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The E-Rate program provides universal service funding to connect schools and libraries to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0e2kR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Your prompt action would provide an essential down payment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h6vQZ6"&gt;“We urge you to now use your new leadership of the FCC to depart from the prior Commission’s erroneous position,” the senators wrote. “Although the funds currently available through the E-Rate will not be enough to connect every student across the country, your prompt action would provide an essential down payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCWkMT"&gt;Previous FCC Chair Ajit Pai denied these calls for E-Rate expansion throughout his tenure at the agency during the pandemic. A minority commissioner at the time called on the FCC to use the E-Rate program to ensure students have the devices and connectivity needed to participate in remote learning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;in an op-ed for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ekfzg"&gt;There are already indications that the FCC will take action on the issue. Earlier this week, Rosenworcel announced that the FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/e-rate-schools-libraries-usf-program"&gt;would seek comment&lt;/a&gt; on petitions to open up E-Rate program funds for use in supporting remote learning during the pandemic, a first step in more substantial changes to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oANSVh"&gt;“We need to get to work to update E-Rate funding so all our students can be connected to virtual classrooms, no matter who they are or where they live,” Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “Kids shouldn’t have to do homework in parking lots because that’s the only place they can get online. We can do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLn9Lq"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsradH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UREgKa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly requiring 10-hour overnight shifts for some workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lG6JQg4dMS1gv10wrADL0pqu7Js=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769527/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hUccL6"&gt;Amazon recently told workers at its in DCH1 warehouse in Chicago they had to take 10-hour overnight shifts at a new warehouse or risk losing their jobs, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVwuZm"&gt;The shifts, known as “megacycle” shifts, typically begin around 1AM and end around lunchtime. The DCH1 warehouse used to have a variety of shifts including an eight-hour overnight shift, a five-hour morning shift, or a four-hour morning shift. But DCH1 is shutting down, the company told workers, and for anyone who wants to move to a new Amazon warehouse the 10-hour megacycle shift is their only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ft0v0"&gt;The shifts are meant to improve efficiency, according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, and workers at delivery stations in other cities have already transitioned to the new megacycle shifts, along with half of Amazon’s last-mile delivery network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhjxB1"&gt;“We are excited to have recently launched three new, next generation delivery stations for DCH1 employees where they can continue to work and grow as an integral part of the Amazon team in state-of-art facilities,” Amazon spokesperson Jen Crowcroft said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our associates are the heart and soul of our operations, and we are happy to continue to offer great, flexible career opportunities in world class facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWYUlc"&gt;DCH1 Amazonians United, a group representing Amazon workers at DCH1, said the new schedule was “unworkable” for many of the warehouse employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;Ten-hour shifts&lt;/a&gt; are not uncommon at Amazon warehouses, and many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892693/amazon-protest-time-off-part-time-workers-sacramento-fired"&gt;warehouse employees are part-time&lt;/a&gt; workers not eligible for benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxnTF4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;Warehouse workers have criticized Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for how the company has treated them during the coronavirus pandemic. Workers in New York, Chicago, and Detroit staged walk-offs last spring, which pushed the company to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204254/amazon-warehouse-walkout-coronavirus-protections-masks-temperature"&gt;temperature checks and provide masks&lt;/a&gt;, offer &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-employees-with-fever-5-hours-pay"&gt;partial pay&lt;/a&gt; in some instances when it sends sick employees home, and implement cleaning protocols to protect its workers from becoming infected. The company has largely dismissed most of the workers’ complaints as “unfounded,” with executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206108/amazon-chris-smalls-warehouse-strike-nyc-jay-carney-bernie-sanders-coronavirus-safety"&gt;insulting one fired worker&lt;/a&gt; who helped organize a strike at its Staten Island facility last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIdicr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 4th, 1:21PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bezos’ climate fund faces a reckoning with Amazon’s pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-CLIMATE-AMAZON-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4KO_pBbqaNFZzAURTGIWBKYnis=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769195/1169518004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;People living with Amazon’s pollution see gaps in Bezos’ funding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7t8fLB"&gt;Once he steps down as CEO of Amazon later this year, Jeff Bezos will have more time to focus on his “&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;passions&lt;/a&gt;,” including his $10 billion Earth Fund aimed at addressing climate change. That’s a huge sum that could have an outsized impact on climate action, but vulnerable communities — including those affected by Amazon’s warehouses — say they’ve been excluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8X6tX"&gt;So far, Bezos has only allocated $791 million — just under 8 percent of the total fund — to 16 environmental organizations. That injection of cash is still enormous. His grants, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, have already fattened the budgets of some mainstream advocacy groups, such as the Environmental Defense Fund. The majority of his grants went to larger organizations with less diverse leadership. Smaller, grassroots groups representing communities of color say they’ve been left out. They’re asking for recognition and funding. And they want Bezos to do more for communities living with pollution from Amazon’s warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6W3Ud"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ogl0Qr"&gt;In February 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;Bezos pledged&lt;/a&gt; to give some of his personal fortune to “scientists, activists, [and] NGOs” tackling climate change. Since the pandemic erupted in March, Bezos’ personal wealth has ballooned by more than &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/12/22/amazon-and-walmart-have-raked-in-billions-in-additional-profits-during-the-pandemic-and-shared-almost-none-of-it-with-their-workers/#:~:text=Together%2C%20they%20have%20earned%20an,companies%20studied%20in%20our%20report."&gt;$75 billion&lt;/a&gt;. While many other businesses shut down during stay-at-home orders, Amazon’s business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;boomed&lt;/a&gt; because more people shopped online. Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to grow&lt;/a&gt;, too, despite Bezos’ “passion” for climate action and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;2019 commitment&lt;/a&gt; from his company to reign in its climate pollution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An aerial view of San Bernardino International Airport, which has attracted some major businesses, like Kohl’s, Pepboys Auto, Mattel, and Stater Bros. to establish warehouses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjlyYQ"&gt;“I’m actually really frustrated with this. He has an opportunity to do so much with the funds that he has provided out there, although I would still consider it chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people,” says Gabriela Mendez, a community organizer with the nonprofit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ). CCAEJ has fought to clean up the air in California’s Inland Empire, a region with some of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;worst smog&lt;/a&gt; in the nation. It’s a community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;increasingly dominated&lt;/a&gt; by warehouses for e-commerce, and a lot of pollution comes from vehicles moving goods to and from those facilities. Amazon happens to be the &lt;a href="http://roseinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Spring2018_Amazon-in-the-IE.pdf"&gt;biggest private employer in the region&lt;/a&gt;, so CCAEJ and other local groups have pushed the company to guarantee stronger worker protections and to switch to zero-emissions electric trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mPKXL"&gt;Mendez says there’s been an onslaught of truck traffic through her neighborhood since an Amazon warehouse opened up nearby. “He really needs to take a look at this and prioritize these communities,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EB45qg"&gt;The five established “big green” groups that benefited the most from Bezos’ Earth Fund were each allotted $100 million in November, or nearly two-thirds of Bezos’ first round of funding. They are the Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. These organizations have traditionally held more sway in politics; for instance, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s former executive director, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238544/trump-pollution-rollbacks-coronavirus-covid-19-gina-mccarthy-epa"&gt;Gina McCarthy,&lt;/a&gt; is now Joe Biden’s domestic climate czar. They are also groups that have historically worked more closely with corporations on sustainability initiatives, such as the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdRKUD"&gt;The EDF tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has already received its $100 million grant. That’s equal to about half of its typical operating budget for a year, although it plans to spend the money over three years. The majority of the spending will go toward launching a satellite in 2022 to monitor methane emissions, a super greenhouse gas, and building a platform to make that data publicly available. (When asked if Bezos’ Blue Origin would play a role, EDF said it had previously signed a contract with SpaceX to launch the satellite prior to receiving an Earth Fund grant). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUcRb2"&gt;A smaller portion of EDF’s grant will go toward efforts to vet so-called “nature-based solutions.” These are popular with companies who want to offset their pollution by investing in things like forest conservation. Many of these projects don’t permanently trap greenhouse gasses, &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into these carbon offset schemes have found. One, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, was even focused on one of Bezos’ grantees, the Nature Conservancy. Nevertheless, companies buy into them and claim that they’re canceling out their carbon footprint. EDF says that’s why funding their effort to vet these projects is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qiHVG"&gt;Several other grantees plan to focus their work on similar “nature-based solutions.” Separately, Amazon and other tech companies have funneled money into still-unproven technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; pledged $1 billion and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; committed $1 million a year to develop the technology. Until that technology is deployed at scale — and there are still questions over whether it’s too &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2021/01/direct-air-capture-definition-cost-considerations#:~:text=The%20range%20of%20costs%20for,the%20scale%20of%20their%20deployment."&gt;costly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100"&gt;energy intensive&lt;/a&gt; to do so — we won’t know whether those investments will succeed in permanently trapping and storing the carbon dioxide. In the meantime, the planet is continuing to heat up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="siSLQh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It reinforces practices that caused the crisis in the first place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MFHrW3"&gt;Groups like the Climate Justice Alliance, a cohort of organizations focused on tackling environmental racism, see these market-based solutions as a cop-out for corporate polluters. By funding these sorts of things, companies can say they’re tackling climate change. But if they aren’t weaning themselves off fossil fuels at the same time, they’re still contributing to the crisis and potentially delaying the transition to cleaner energy. “It reinforces practices that caused the crisis in the first place, perpetuating sacrifice zones and doing nothing to reduce emissions at the source,” CJA said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjbjsH"&gt;That’s why CJA wants to see more funding in the hands of grassroots groups that push companies to stop burning fossil fuels in the first place. They also want to stop pollution at the source because greenhouse gas emissions are usually accompanied by soot or other toxins. Capturing greenhouse gases alone doesn’t absolve companies like Amazon from the health threats posed by those other pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9f1i5"&gt;“No amount of greenwashing will absolve Jeff Bezos or Amazon of the harm they have inflicted on frontline communities and workers, or our planet,” CJA said. “If the Earth Fund wants to purport to save the planet, they should send funds directly to grassroots communities who are the least responsible and hardest hit by climate disaster and the kinds of rapacious business practices Bezos engages in.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8P9fMk"&gt;There’s another problem — people of color are &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6001?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=89531294&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xNvMHn1bWk9yKfonfI3tKRFqpBykQxjDPLwQQ8jOWV6x-lOYIn8RzUEdKwvI0RkzvF9opoWwdz4RPe8VAmXGxrue0heNyHVsPkDmeLZHAAcWSn38&amp;amp;utm_content=89531294&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; than white people to live in polluted areas. Both &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CJA_CWF-letter_2.2021.pdf"&gt;ClimateWorks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063352981"&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/a&gt; have also faced criticism for lacking diversity, because the people who are most affected by pollution aren’t getting a seat at the table. Both groups have made commitments to include environmental and racial justice in their work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmOjVu"&gt;“We know we can always do more to include the voices of groups working on the frontlines,” said Shawn Reifsteck, a vice president at ClimateWorks, in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUxUrW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;In December&lt;/a&gt;, the Climate Justice Alliance asked groups that received funding from Bezos to redirect 10 to 25 percent of those monies to a pooled fund. The fund would be governed by grassroots organizers from communities most impacted by pollution and climate change. CJA says “several” grantees have agreed to consider it. ClimateWorks says they’re in communication with CJA. But others might have their hands tied. EDF says that the funds it received from Bezos are restricted to its two projects on methane and nature-based solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXBRXo"&gt;“The reason that we ended up with those two projects is that Jeff [Bezos], when he first called us to talk about what he was up to, we talked about a range of things that are important — and these were a couple of the ideas that he had an interest in,” says EDF president Fred Krupp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bnq94u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos’ money has an outsized effect&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cZuA69"&gt;Because less than &lt;a href="https://www.climateworks.org/report/funding-trends-climate-change-mitigation-philanthropy/"&gt;2 percent&lt;/a&gt; of global philanthropy goes toward solving the climate crisis, Bezos’ money has an outsized effect. Very little of the existing philanthropy addresses environmental and racial inequities, according to ClimateWorks. So far, Bezos’ donations continue that practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBACNO"&gt;“By every measure, the Bezos Earth Fund’s $10 billion commitment is game-changing,” says ClimateWorks’ Reifsteck. Bezos hasn’t said how long it will take him to distribute the entire $10 billion. Still, that sum is ten times as much as foundations typically give in one year. And Bezos’ first round of funding did include some smaller grants to scrappier groups. That includes the NDN Collective, founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to support indigenous-led campaigns and sustainability initiatives, and the Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, launched in 2019 to raise money for women of color-led organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCkmMA"&gt;“The first round of grants from The Bezos Earth Fund included a total of $151 million in funding to five organizations with deep roots and expertise in environmental justice,” a representative of the Bezos Earth Fund said in an email. “The groups are using this money to make their own grants to hundreds of smaller-scale organizations doing critical climate justice work in communities across the U.S., and to build and scale their own infrastructure and impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XErP9G"&gt;Still, the Inland Empire, where Mendez lives, hasn’t seen anything “game-changing” since Bezos’ fund got off the ground. Instead, they’re grappling with more polluting infrastructure mushrooming across the region. For instance, Amazon plans to move into an &lt;a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2020/05/08/amazon-is-landing-at-san-bernardino-airport-officials-say/"&gt;air cargo logistics&lt;/a&gt; center. And even though their communities could use the funding, they worry about Bezos’ outsized influence. Will climate groups avoid pressuring Amazon in order to keep the Bezos donations coming? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pXEJPL"&gt;“If these organizations are receiving those dollars from the Earth Fund, are there going to be strings attached?” says Faraz Rizvi, a special projects coordinator working alongside Mendez at CCAEJ. “Overall, I remain kind of pessimistic about these funds being able to continue to hold Amazon accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4exiM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd9zj6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists want to know if vaccinated people can still become COVID-19 long-haulers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIYYsEjOmCv8PEmN76uHphWMcR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768971/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RA0Z1g"&gt;Data from multiple COVID-19 vaccines makes it clear that the shots protect against the most severe outcomes of the disease: hospitalization and death. But it’s still unclear how well the vaccines will reduce the risk of chronic, long-term symptoms, which a small &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/14/21324201/covid-19-long-term-effects-symptoms-treatment"&gt;but significant&lt;/a&gt; number of COVID-19 patients experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDsm9"&gt;“It’s an incredibly important question that we just don’t know the answer to,” says Timothy Henrich, a virologist and viral immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco who is studying the &lt;a href="https://www.liincstudy.org/en/team"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V6rb7c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an incredibly important question that we just don’t know the answer to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUqYld"&gt;The various COVID-19 vaccines tested so far, including those made by Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, and Novavax, are all remarkably consistent in their near-perfect protection against hospitalization and death. These vaccines will be able to relieve pressure on health care systems and slow the overwhelming tally of COVID-19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S92Df3"&gt;But the vaccines aren’t perfect shields against getting sick with COVID-19. While they turned what may have been some severe cases of the disease into mild ones — a huge victory for public health — a handful of people in the clinical trials still got sick. In addition, it’s still not clear if the vaccines can block infection with the virus entirely or if they’re mainly able to make people asymptomatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGxRC"&gt;Scientists don’t know if a muted case of the disease in someone who has been vaccinated would be enough to trigger persistent symptoms. “I think it’s likely that they could,” says Priya Duggal, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, who’s also studying long-term symptoms of COVID-19. Many people who experience chronic symptoms didn’t get seriously sick during their initial infection. “They’re not necessarily hospitalized patients. A number are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the early phase,” Duggal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="quCEsO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many people who experience chronic symptoms didn’t get seriously sick during their initial infection&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FvyDH"&gt;Researchers still don’t have a good understanding of long-haulers overall. Their symptoms are diverse: some people may have altered taste or smell, while others could have consistent fevers and be short of breath for months. It’s also unclear what causes those symptoms to stick around after the acute phase of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOuPBZ"&gt;“There may be several different mechanisms that are going to be causing this to happen,” Henrich says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0W1dN"&gt;One theory is that long-haulers’ immune systems didn’t manage to wipe out the virus completely during their initial infection. Even though the person is no longer infectious, they may still have bits of virus or viral fragments lingering in their body, causing damage.  If that is the case, it’s possible that vaccination would prevent that from happening, says Aaron Ring, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine. “This is all hypothetical, but a vaccine, which can boost a very effective immune response, could promote more complete viral clearance,” he says. “In theory, if that was the mechanism, it could help prevent some of those symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gih9MC"&gt;If that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the mechanism, a vaccine might have less of a direct route to preventing those symptoms. Infection might provoke the immune system to attack the body, or the virus that does slip through could damage organs in a way that takes a long time to heal. If someone is vaccinated and still ends up with a mild case of disease, the virus could, in theory, still do that. “Would a vaccine interfere with that, or would a vaccine not interfere with that — that’s not known,” Duggal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy1p5g"&gt;Duggal and Heinrich are hoping to find answers on the relationship between vaccination and long-haulers through their research on COVID-19 patients. Duggal is running a survey of 25,000 people who’ve had the disease, and it includes a question asking if they’ve been vaccinated or are participating in a vaccine trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvaeTu"&gt;Heinrich and his team are following people with persistent symptoms over time. “We’re looking for people who have been vaccinated and also become infected,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXzEsp"&gt;Duggal isn’t sure vaccines will reduce the risk for persistent symptoms entirely. “I think there is going to be a small percentage of people that could get infected even post-vaccination that could become long-haulers,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aubrc8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not likely that vaccination, by converting severe cases of COVID-19 to mild cases, will create &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;long-haulers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVklqc"&gt;To be clear, it’s not likely that vaccination, by converting severe cases of COVID-19 to mild cases, will create &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;long-haulers, says Jessica Dine, a pulmonary specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “That’s not what we typically observe with other vaccines,” she says. “With the flu shot, you can still get the flu, even though you’ll get a milder case. But we don’t see an increase in stuff like post-viral inflammation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qGXyJ"&gt;Dine’s best guess is that we’ll see fewer people with long-term symptoms as more people get vaccinated. Right now, the percentage of people who get COVID-19 and end up with long-term symptoms is fairly high — some estimates put it around &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21523448/covid-long-term-effects-symptoms-damage"&gt;10 percent, with others going higher.&lt;/a&gt; Duggal also hopes vaccination could cut that number down. “If people are vaccinated, can we drop that number to one to five percent? Can we get it lower? I’m hoping that’s what it is,” she says. “I just don’t know, but I’m hoping it’ll be fewer people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffbu9d"&gt;In the meantime, the researchers stress that there’s a clear way vaccines will reduce the number of long-haulers: by driving down the number of infections in the population overall. “As more people get vaccinated, there’s less virus circulating,” Duggal says. That means fewer people getting sick, which leads to fewer people experiencing long-term symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbbJee"&gt;“If we’re going to ever try to reach this mountain of herd immunity, people have to get vaccinated,” she says. “If we can do that, we’re also protecting ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel phones will be able to read your heart rate with their cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aC9EkTrl_VN6gSuJXemmBtOgWpY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768699/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9V75SL"&gt;Google is adding heart and respiratory rate monitors to the Fit app on Pixel phones this month, and it plans to add them to other Android phones in the future. Both features rely on the smartphone camera: it measures respiratory rate by monitoring the rise and fall of a user’s chest, and heart rate by tracking color change as blood moves through the fingertip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNxMh1"&gt;The features are only intended to let users track overall wellness and cannot evaluate or diagnose medical conditions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHtheG"&gt;To measure respiratory rate (the number of breaths someone takes per minute) using the app, users point the phone’s front-facing camera at their head and chest. To measure heart rate, they place their finger over the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66z2Drv_3d8aGxVhzGoE6KrjFQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279419/RR_Pixel_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel users can measure their respiratory rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fEjYOZ"&gt;A doctor counts a patient’s respiratory rate by watching their chest rise and fall, and the Google feature mimics that procedure, said Jack Po, a product manager at Google Health, in a press briefing. “The machine learning technique that we leverage basically tries to emulate that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NaUF5"&gt;Google’s heart rate monitor is similar to a feature that Samsung included&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on a number of older model Galaxy smartphones, including the Galaxy &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/07/galaxy-s10-vs-s20-2020-which-should-you-buy/"&gt;S10&lt;/a&gt;. The company removed the feature for the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/i-cannot-measure-heart-rate-with-my-galaxy-s10e/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S10E&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/07/galaxy-s10-vs-s20-2020-which-should-you-buy/"&gt;S20&lt;/a&gt;, and later phones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KQc6"&gt;Heart rate data from Google’s app will be less comprehensive than the types of readings someone could get from a wearable device, which can continuously monitor something like heart rate as someone goes through their daily life. But an at-home feature that can check in on these metrics on demand is still a useful tool, Po said in the briefing. Anything that increases the number of measurements someone has of their heart or breathing rate is important — doctors, for example, usually only get a measurement at most every few months as someone comes into an office, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtjWAy"&gt;“If users were to take their heart rate once a week, they would actually get a lot of value,” Po said. “They’ll get a lot of value in tracking whether their heart rate might be improving, if exercise is paying off.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_c9MiwziyRUdZpqK56Wql5vKEmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279429/Google_Fit_measuring_heart_rate.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EwoGCJ"&gt;Google chose to incorporate these functions into the smartphone in order to make it accessible to the widest number of people, Po said. “A lot of people, especially in disadvantaged economic classes right now, don’t have things like wearables, but would still really benefit from the ability to be able to track their breathing rate, heart rate, et cetera.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vag54F"&gt;Internal studies on Pixel phones showed that the respiratory rate feature was accurate within one breath per minute both for people with and without health conditions, said Jiening Zhan, a technical lead at Google Health, during the press briefing. The heart rate feature was accurate within 2 percent. That feature was tested on people with a range of skin tones, and it had a similar accuracy for light and dark skin, she said. The team plans to publish a scientific paper with the data from its evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yue4Hc"&gt;The team will study how well the features work on other phones before making them available outside of the Pixel. “We want to make sure that you know, the rigorous testing is done before it’s released to other devices,” Zhan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVxo1M"&gt;Right now, the features are described as tools that can be used for general wellness. Google isn’t claiming that they can perform a medical function — which is why it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;doesn’t need clearance&lt;/a&gt; from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add them to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwNSM7"&gt;Eventually, they might take the app down that road, Po indicated. The tests done on the features show that they’re consistent with clinical products, he said, so it’s a possibility in the future. “Frankly, we haven’t done enough testing and validation to say that it can definitely work for those use cases yet, but it’s definitely something we’re exploring,” Po said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKTgXt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajRVN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Brio, the holy grail of webcams, is $40 off right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GxAvvg"&gt;Not long ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14531452/logitech-brio-4k-pro-webcam"&gt;Logitech’s Brio&lt;/a&gt; webcam (along with almost any other kind of webcam made by reputable companies) was impossible to find. We’re now at the point where you can get $40 off this 4K model through Lenovo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Faccessories-and-monitors%2Fwebcams-and-video%2Fwebcams%2FLogitech-BRIO-4K-Ultra-HD-webcam-web-camera%2Fp%2F78010686&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266146%2Flogitech-brio-webcam-seagate-xbox-nvme-ssd-hisense-tv-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knocking it down to $160&lt;/a&gt; instead of $200. It’s still a big investment, but if you stream or just want to look your best in a meeting, this is one of the best choices out there to suit those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34u7CS"&gt;Lenovo is currently the only site hosting this deal, so it may not last for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cc4gi1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319769"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="Lkg3gK"&gt;Xbox Series X / S owners can get $10 off one of Seagate’s 1TB NVMe expansion cards at Newegg.

    <title>Rad Power Bikes raises $150 million to grow its electric bike empire</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tfq3zp"&gt;Rad Power Bikes just announced a $150 million investment to expand its retail footprint and improve its maintenance and repair services. It’s one of the largest investments in an e-bike company to date and reflects the growing demand for electric-powered transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw2OSU"&gt;Investors in this round include Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund, Counterpoint Global; Fidelity Management and Research Company; The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG; and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as existing investors like Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JbRLZF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think overall it’s a really exciting moment for the direct-to-consumer e-bike space and for e-bikes just in general”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVRBZO"&gt;“I think overall it’s a really exciting moment for the direct-to-consumer e-bike space and for e-bikes just in general,” Rad Power Bikes CEO Mike Radenbaugh told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a recent interview. “This amount of fundraising is normally reserved for — how should I say this — less cash-efficient businesses, like bike-share for example, and this amount of funding really allows us to invest in doubling down on serious infrastructure, both supply chain and after-sales support and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5OzjX8Rn9NHvbSJ-Vwhjx5UfA7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280953/378437_2_cfc583_original_1612411492.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ckwr90"&gt;Rad Power Bikes plans on doubling its 325-person workforce by next year, Radenbaugh said, with a heavy focus on research and development. It will also allow the company to accelerate the expansion of its retail and service network, which is already slated to cover 75 percent of US customers by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXpAtd"&gt;Rad Power Bikes is the largest e-bike maker in the US, offering 11 different models, from the fat-tire Rad Rover to the new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21299601/rad-power-bike-radmission-electric-bike-ebike-price-specs"&gt;slimmer RadMission&lt;/a&gt;. Radenbaugh founded the company in 2015, after several years of selling his custom-made e-bikes to customers on the West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LxGhw"&gt;Venture capital firms have been pouring money into electric bike and scooter companies over the past few years. But while investor interest in shared scooter companies in particular appears to have cooled off in recent months, e-bike makers continue to attract a lot of attention, especially as sales numbers spiked during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pMlhI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ezyOeN"&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;enormously popular over the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;. A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62-percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144 percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVmxI9"&gt;Consulting firm Deloitte &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;estimated in a report last year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of e-bikes in circulation worldwide should reach 300 million by 2023 — a 50-percent increase over 2019’s 200 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdt7DS"&gt;Investors see a clear opportunity in continuing to fuel that growth. Rad Power Bikes closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rad-power-bikes-closes-25-million-in-funding-to-grow-direct-to-consumer-electric-bike-business-300999573.html"&gt;$25 million deal&lt;/a&gt; last February, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;Dutch e-bike brand VanMoof landed $40 million&lt;/a&gt; in September. European VCs poured $165 million into e-bikes in 2019 and 2020, more than the previous four years combined, according to data from PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kG6L3"&gt;Radenbaugh hinted the added capital will help grow Rad Power Bikes beyond the world of two-wheeled transportation. “We’ve got our sights set on something much bigger than an e-bike brand and that’s what these investors saw as they started to dig deeper into Rad,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcokFbaWU9qlgedeKadPm7c-P3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768503/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fao8AG"&gt;It’s no secret Apple is hard at work on augmented and virtual reality devices, with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January claiming Apple is working on an ultra-high-end, pricey headset that could hit stores in 2022. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on what to expect from the potential headset, including a rendering — said to be based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype from last year” — of what the device might actually look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otDr5Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s report corroborates several details from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s, including the fabric mesh material that the company is said to be using in order to lighten the weight of the device — and the high price tag. The new report claims the price could reach approximately $3,000, considerably higher than most other standalone VR headsets, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the $299 Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxQvjR"&gt;The alleged design also appears to borrow cues from a variety of other Apple devices, including swappable Apple Watch-style headbands and a HomePod-esque mesh fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="soEngY"&gt;There are also new details on the actual hardware for the rumored device, which is said to offer both VR and mixed reality applications, thanks to over a dozen cameras (for tracking hand movement) and LIDAR sensors (for mapping rooms, similar to AR effects on the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro). It is also said to feature dual 8K displays with eye-tracking technology that could offer resolution far beyond any current commercial VR headsets on the market today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1BTwT"&gt;Notably, the report claims Apple won’t be running the power-hungry 8K displays at full resolution the entire time. Instead, the device will use the eye-tracking technology to determine where users are looking and then rendering peripheral areas in lower resolution to improve performance (a technique in the VR world known as foveated rendering). The chips, as previously reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, are expected to be internally developed Apple Silicon hardware that could potentially be more powerful than Apple’s current M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x2J91"&gt;Apple is reportedly experimenting with a variety of control methods, including hand-tracking and eye-tracking, a dial mounted on the side of the headset, and a “thimble-like” accessory, although nothing is said to be finalized just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tE5v9"&gt;The headset, described mostly as a VR device with more limited AR functions, is still intended to be a key step toward Apple’s ultimate goal: a lightweight AR device indistinguishable from standard eyeglasses. That device is still said to be years away from release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdyVXF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtGUsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview’s facial recognition tech is illegal mass surveillance, Canada privacy commissioners say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyOWKhL5eHGSQuU10cEqywxgzk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768357/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3WIxq"&gt;Clearview AI’s facial recognition amounts to mass surveillance and the company should delete the faces of Canadians from its database, &lt;a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210203/"&gt;Canada’s privacy commissioners said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNAkos"&gt;Commissioner Daniel Therrien said what Clearview does — scraping photos from social media and other public sites for use by law enforcement — is “illegal” and creates a system that “inflicts broad-based harm on all members of society, who find themselves continually in a police lineup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E68Q7l"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2021/pipeda-2021-001/#toc2"&gt;commissioners released a report&lt;/a&gt; that follows a yearlong investigation by several Canadian privacy agencies into Clearview’s practices, which found the company had collected highly sensitive biometric information without consent and that it “used and disclosed Canadians’ personal information for inappropriate purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kC92jL"&gt;According to the investigators, the company maintains that Canada’s privacy laws don’t apply to Clearview since it does not have a “real and substantial connection” to the country, and that consent from individuals was not required because the information it collected was publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDUEFL"&gt;Clearview’s database of some 3 billion images was revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;raising serious concerns about privacy&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s practice of taking images from social media violated the platforms’ rules, and tech platforms sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;cease-and-desist orders to Clearview&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K3ej2s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dozens of law enforcement agencies in Canada had used the software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NUecjt"&gt;Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/technology/clearview-ai-illegal-canada.html?"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company had ceased operations in Canada last July due to the investigation, and he added that Clearview was not planning to delete Canadians’ images from its database, but that people could request their data be removed by using an opt-out form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsBFVi"&gt;The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was among the dozens of law enforcement and other organizations in Canada that had paid for Clearview’s services.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3XgQu"&gt;The commissioners don’t have the authority to fine companies or order them to leave Canada, but they sent a letter of intention to Clearview telling the company to stop scraping images of Canadians’ faces, stop offering its facial recognition product in Canada, and to delete previously collected images of Canadians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWMSVr"&gt;It’s not the first time Clearview has been ordered to remove images from its database. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;terminated all its contracts in the state of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; last May — the majority of which were with law enforcement agencies — following a lawsuit alleging Clearview had violated the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act. Clearview also said at the time it was canceling the contracts of any non-law enforcement entities; a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Clearview’s list of private clients had included Bank of America, Walmart, and Macy’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COcEzi"&gt;Clearview AI has said it plans to challenge the decision in court. In an statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; Doug Mitchell, an attorney for Clearview AI, likened the company to Google. “Clearview AI is a search engine that collects public data just as much larger companies do, including Google, which is permitted to operate in Canada,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggOP81"&gt;Mitchell added that while Clearview’s technology is not available in Canada and does not operate in Canada currently, its practice of collecting public information from the internet is “explicitly permitted” under Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3huqZZ"&gt;“The Federal Court of Appeal has previously ruled in the privacy context that publicly available information means exactly what it says: ‘available or accessible by the citizenry at large.’ There is no reason to apply a different standard here,” Mitchell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb0kA9"&gt;Use of Clearview AI’s facial recognition among law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;spiked 26 percent on January 7th&lt;/a&gt;, one day after a mob of rioters attacked the US Capitol, with several police departments using Clearview software to assist the FBI with identifying the rioters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;Clearview also has contracts&lt;/a&gt; with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdl7BN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 4th, 11:16AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Clearview AI attorney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
