    <title>Apple refuses to make NDA concessions for workplace harassment and discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUhJoO"&gt;Apple, like many tech companies, has an intimidating employment agreement that it makes employees sign to protect its trade secrets. Though the agreement is in place to prevent workers from sharing internal details of Apple’s products and processes, it is unclear whether they can speak out about working conditions, according to a group of activists and Apple shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TSvVF"&gt;Now, that group is pushing the company to add language that makes clearer exception for cases of workplace harassment and discrimination. Apple has refused. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.niaimpactcapital.com/apple-resolution"&gt;they filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; to pressure Apple to make the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilqmYS"&gt;“We approached Apple in good faith and encouraged them to take a leadership role here,” says Ifeoma Ozoma, who’s helping to lead the effort. “Their response was to use the same employee handbook that they’ve reportedly been using to silence workers as an excuse to say no. We responded that this wasn’t acceptable — and curiously haven’t heard back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jLnYx"&gt;Ozoma is co-sponsor of the Silenced No More Act, a California bill that would protect employees who speak out about workplace misconduct, even if they’ve signed an NDA. On August 30th, &lt;a href="https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2021-08-30-senator-leyva%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Csilenced-no-more-act%E2%80%9D-clears-final-legislative-hurdle-and-advances"&gt;the bill passed the California state legislature and advanced to Governor Newsom’s desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd61yP"&gt;The effort stems from Ozoma’s own experience &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;breaking an NDA to speak out about discrimination at Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;. In California, employees technically have the right to discuss sex discrimination. But there’s nothing that protects those who go public with experiences of racism — a gap that left Ozoma vulnerable to litigation when she decided to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiS5GF"&gt;As the Silenced No More Act inches closer to becoming law, Ozoma has been pressuring tech companies to proactively adopt the following language in their employment agreements: “Nothing in this agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0eXMq"&gt;Ozoma says Apple lawyers declined to add the language, noting that it’s already covered in the company’s Business Conduct Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqqJbs"&gt;However, in recent months, some Apple employees have voiced concerns that the company is doing exactly that: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;making it difficult for them to discuss wages and working conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Ozoma says there’s also a key difference between adding this language to an employee handbook and putting it in an employment agreement which would legally protect workers who speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4TpWU"&gt;Apple’s internal misconduct policy also says that employees can be fired for “Engaging in activities or behaviors that violate Apple policies,” “Interfering or failing to cooperate with an investigation,” as well as simply “insubordination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8w7Hh"&gt;On Friday, Nia Impact Capital filed a shareholder resolution saying that concealment clauses — or employment agreements that contain broad arbitration, nondisclosure, or non-disparagement agreements — are bad business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSg2JS"&gt;“We filed this shareholder resolution at Apple because a company’s use of concealment clauses is both a governance and a diversity concern,” says Kristin Hull, CEO of Nia Impact. “Concealment clauses block investors from understanding true workplace conditions and may undermine diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The Board, as the representatives of the investor, should be concerned about the role concealment clauses play in enabling harmful corporate cultures to continue, hidden from stakeholders.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpbbIP"&gt;The firm owns 38,921.34 Apple shares — a stake currently worth roughly $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGCZEs"&gt;If Apple does not make the requested changes, the resolution may go before a vote at the next shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPC97B"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouNrgu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNPDw2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best part of Life is Strange: True Colors is that you can finally binge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ik8wQcE8uYwIPrKNmEv_Y7Urns=/449x0:3689x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69830251/lis_tc_launch_longlist_019.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A game that balances horror, heartbreak, and mystery  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="COF4dF"&gt;At this point, the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange &lt;/em&gt;formula is well established. Each game follows a young adult going through some kind of personal trauma, while also learning to deal with a newfound superpower, whether it’s time travel or telekinesis. So far it has worked in a few different flavors: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up"&gt;the original felt a bit like an interactive &lt;em&gt;Veronica Mars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod"&gt;its sequel built on that with a bold and overtly political story&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is the latest entry in the growing anthology, and it once again features a troubled kid with special abilities who’s struggling to keep it together. It also makes a big change by ditching the episodic format and releasing the complete story all at once&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfeqAk"&gt;Aside from that, it doesn’t mess with the formula much, nor does it make the daring narrative leaps of &lt;em&gt;LiS2&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it feels like a refinement. It takes the best parts of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; — choice-driven gameplay, characters you’ll fall in love with, a vibe that’s like an interactive indie rock album — and applies them to a new dark mystery that’s hard to put down. And that’s a whole lot easier now that you can binge the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OBkqD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; centers on Alex Chen, a 21-year-old who has spent nearly a decade bouncing around the foster care system. At the outset of the game that’s about to change: she’s getting ready to move in with her estranged brother in an idyllic small town in Colorado. It’s an eccentric and charming place with a kick-ass record store, a pub run by a man full of fatherly wisdom, a dispensary with an art studio in the back, and stunning mountain views no matter which direction you look. After so long without a real home, it’s maybe the perfect place for Alex to settle down for a bit. She easily falls back into a familial routine with her brother — one of the first things they do is rock out in an embarrassing air guitar session — and quickly befriends seemingly everyone in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DNJwFQYL8GF4c2rpSXN0QrjH0Sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834047/lis_tc_launch_longlist_044.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GJoIe"&gt;Of course, this is &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, so things don’t stay so peaceful for long. I won’t spoil the specifics, but there’s a significant death fairly early on (I can say from experience that even if you know it’s coming, it still hits really hard) that leads Alex down a rabbit hole of figuring out how it actually happened. At its core, &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is a classic small town murder mystery, the kind where everyone seems like they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a suspect once you dig in a little. Eventually, you’ll learn that there’s a sinister history to the place, including a powerful corporation with a strong hold on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD1l7o"&gt;What makes it feel distinctly like &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; comes down to a combination of gameplay and tone. If you’ve never played any of these games before, they’re essentially interactive dramas, where you spend as much time watching events unfold as participating. Your interactions mostly come in two forms: making decisions and investigating. Often the game will present you with a binary choice that influences how the story plays out, or how other characters respond to Alex. That could mean intervening in a domestic squabble or choosing with whom to flirt. (&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; presents two very appealing romantic options that can be hard to choose between.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GYptNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the team behind Life is Strange: True Colors created its empathetic new lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393602/life-is-strange-true-colors-alex-chen-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN6fuW"&gt;The twist here is Alex’s power, which allows her to see someone’s “aura.” Essentially, she can tell how someone is feeling by looking at them — they’ll glow different colors depending on mood — and then use that to delve further into their psyche. This can play out in a few different ways. Sometimes, she’s able to change someone’s emotional state by learning about them and saying or doing the right thing; other times she can use that information to help people in more practical ways. In one scene, Alex helps an amnesiac remember what they were doing. In another, she is able to talk a scared young boy into following her to safety. Her power feels perfectly in tune with the game. &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; has always been a series about listening to and helping people; here it just becomes an overt gameplay mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po9GjZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; also does an incredible job when it comes to pacing and tone. There are times when the action is so fast, and you have to make a hard decision in a split second, that my heart was truly racing. In other moments you can just lounge around on a dock thinking about life. The game lets you linger when needed, both with moments and characters, so you can fully understand them. Things also get incredibly dark, particularly in the later chapters, when Alex is forced to confront the innermost conflicts of both her friends and herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQXZUiWX1CCMK8tg2Ut7Qah21WQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832633/05_Steph_Sadness_Power_1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJYkng"&gt;It balances this out with lots of chill, even playful moments; one chapter takes place almost entirely inside a goofy LARP, and one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game involves helping Alex figure out just what she wants to do with her life. The game jumps between horror and heartbreak, dad jokes and drama, with an ease that’s rare to see in games. &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of game where you’ll be as worried about whether your crush likes you as you are about solving the grisly crime at the center of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUNqG"&gt;The biggest change in &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; comes not from how the game plays, but how it’s being released. Historically, the series has been episodic: each new entry is divided into chapters, which are then released periodically every month or so. It’s a great idea, but the realities of game development often meant there were huge gaps between episodes, making it hard for the story to maintain momentum. In &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;, this is no longer the case: all five chapters are being released at once, and the story benefits from this kind of close connection, where you can see the ramifications of your choices without struggling to remember what happened last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Mz9SHF"&gt;The anthology format has helped keep &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; fresh across three main entries, but it also comes with a significant risk. This is a series where so much relies on your investment in the characters; these stories work because you want to help characters like Max Caulfield and Sean Diaz live a better life. Luckily, despite a new setting and lead, &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; has exactly that. I played through the entire thing in two sittings — not because I had to see how it ended, but because I needed to make sure that Alex was alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyFqIR"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches September 10th on the PC, PS4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Basilisk V3 has more LEDs and a brilliant scroll wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2E8Hx20bGk2uoEjMFgMklfgJTBU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829838/razerbasiliskv3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basilisk V3 features more RGB LEDs than the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PR0aIJ"&gt;Razer’s new Basilisk V3 wired gaming mouse has arrived with more features than its predecessor, as well as a slightly lower price. It’s out now at Razer’s online store, Amazon, and Best Buy from $69.99, a $10 price drop from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMqWn5"&gt;Its scroll wheel houses the biggest improvements, borrowing a trick from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; and G502 Hero. A button positioned next to the Basilisk V3’s wheel can toggle between a staggered scroll mode that offers tactile feedback and a free-spinning mode that lets you sail down the page freely. There’s also an optional feature within Razer’s Synapse software that automatically switches between the two modes depending on the inertia of your scroll, engaging the free-spinning mode with lots of power or keeping it notched during more relaxed line-by-line scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kIHdhPVHVNjmfaYiY5aCgYffrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832021/razerbasiliskv3toggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The side button that toggles the DPI is fixed to the V3, while it was removeable in the last-gen mouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pe24py"&gt;The change that makes it possible to tell apart the Basilisk V3 from the V2 is the new Chroma RGB lighting, one of Razer’s signature stylings. The Razer logo, the trim of the scroll wheel, and a translucent trim lining the bottom of the mouse can light up. Also, the side-mounted DPI sensitivity toggle button is fixed on the V3, whereas it was optional on the V2, leaving it up to you whether you wanted to stick it on magnetically or leave it off. The V3 is also missing the V2’s bottom dial that adjusts the scroll wheel’s tension, but the new free-spinning option is a worthy replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h12yYf"&gt;It’s interesting to find Razer putting more effort toward appealing to a broader audience than just gamers. While the Basilisk V3 is definitely still a gaming mouse in terms of specs and overall design, it might cater to others who wished that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21375181/razer-pro-click-type-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-mechanical-keyboard-humanscale"&gt;Razer’s more productivity-focused Pro Click&lt;/a&gt; shipped with as many features as this $69.99 wired mouse. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Netflix’s Don’t Look Up, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence are astronomers trying to save the world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRXmCNWzcbmp9YZ-15KC20hoAQs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829792/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPlwzD"&gt;It’s not quite as terrifying as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654021/moonfall-trailer-date-halle-berry-roland-emmerich"&gt;the moon falling&lt;/a&gt;, but Netflix’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; deals with another space-related disaster: a comet that’s on a collision course with the Earth. The twist here is that, after two low-level astronomers (played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) discover the problem, no one seems to believe them. That includes a president played by Meryl Streep, with Jonah Hill as her annoying son (and chief of staff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36q1YW"&gt;The first trailer looks like a lot of fun, and the cast is similarly impressive; outside of main stars there are also appearances from the likes of Ron Perlman, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Cate Blanchett, and Tyler Perry. &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; was directed and written by Adam McKay, whose past credits include &lt;em&gt;Anchorman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Step Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tzwJ"&gt;The movie will stream on Netflix on December 24th, after premiering in select theaters on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that Amazon’s game engine can be used to aid humanity in a zombie apocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="zombie (AMC)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOQ5N4lPCMZxbr_XZskU8wKkQTs=/33x0:528x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829691/zombie.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YoOol0"&gt;Amazon’s in-house game engine, Lumberyard, can’t normally be used for life-critical or safety-critical circumstances, as stated in the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/"&gt;terms of service agreement for Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. Things like medical equipment, automated transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, crewed spacecraft, or military use in connection with live combat are all off-limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG9qPG"&gt;Almost all software and hardware come with extensive mandatory agreements that you need to comply with to use them, so these rules are understandable and probably for the best. At the same time, you should also know that some of those rules will go totally out the window in the event of a zombie apocalypse, should it (hopefully not) ever happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J9LbTj"&gt;

&lt;p id="wJNf1A"&gt;Some of us were recently reminded with &lt;a href="https://m.tiktok.com/v/7005317474723859717.html?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8qYkwdR%2FZ90KOvtWKp8pFNfJZOTyuSbeA2XRL1Ri6mCykoa%2FR4nU%2BzceExV%2FTylw9x9RpRJ4u28YPMrQ%2BGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=0fe081c130b1ae3e05fe3708c7e6f028f2a77a8d1962013d673f37326d4f7187&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA3sZqFWVQMOSmlVAdEcGW8agXvp7Mpt8l6LjVD5MQiXK_8ZE-FB4Wmij3ku3-ESP4&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7005317474723859717&amp;amp;share_link_id=e5d1958b-e76d-4af8-beaf-b61e57c3a6cc&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1631059093&amp;amp;u_code=d9082je908b5je&amp;amp;user_id=6750040876368266245&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;this TikTok&lt;/a&gt; of that &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;caveat in the terms that will let users do more with Lumberyard. While the terms stop just shy of calling it an actual “zombie apocalypse,” it’s not leaving much to the imagination in its thorough and very creative description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG4GWe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/"&gt;In section 42.10, about halfway down this page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that these restrictions will lift if the CDC (or a successor body with similar authority) certifies a “widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.” In other words, a real zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U45KR5"&gt;Good to know. Keep this in mind, developers. Amazon’s Lumberyard may be your go-to option in the event of a pandemic that is, thankfully, totally different than the one we’re currently living through.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC’s latest superhero crossover: Batman x FaZe Clan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUDqDNXPJsLYtVf-Gum6DN8C7tw=/0x0:1988x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829596/FaZe_x_Batman_Cover_2_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Batman x FaZe Clan | DC Comics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZyhV9v"&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.dcfandome.com/"&gt;DC’s FanDome&lt;/a&gt; event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650092/dc-fandome-2021-date-batman-gotham-knights-sandman-fortnite"&gt;next month&lt;/a&gt;, the comics company celebrates &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/08/celebrate-batman-day-on-september-19"&gt;Batman Day&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/08/dc-sets-the-stage-for-global-batman-day-celebrations"&gt;a slew of superhero-themed items for fans&lt;/a&gt;. That includes a new ten-episode scripted podcast on HBO Max, an augmented reality app, and, of course, a limited-edition comic featuring some of the stars of FaZe Clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hskIoj"&gt;While we didn’t actually see that last one coming, it is a real thing that will be available in comic form on September 24th. According to DC Comics, you can expect to see FaZe Banks, FaZe Apex, FaZe Temperrr, FaZeRain, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Rug, and FaZe Blaze as heroes, all followed by a slew of crossover merch dropping throughout Batman Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iNpKIJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faze Clan CEO talks growing pains, global expansion, and lawsuits ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004897/podcast-vergecast-lee-trink-faze-clan-interview-apparel-lawsuits-expansion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BrVJwy"&gt;Fulfilling co-owner Lee Trink’s statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004897/podcast-vergecast-lee-trink-faze-clan-interview-apparel-lawsuits-expansion"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes “gaming is going to drive culture and lifestyle for this next decade for sure,” FaZe Clan is the first gaming organization to create a comic with DC, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239034/faze-clan-studios-film-tv-projects"&gt;with its own in-house studio&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unlikely to stop there. If you can’t wait to mix up your gaming and your comics, don’t forget to check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;the six-issue run of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. It pulled the caped crusader into the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe and provided an unusual peek inside the lore of Epic Games’ battle royale title.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LBaa3y"&gt;For the Batman augmented reality experience, kids of all ages can install the DC: Batman Bat-Tech Edition app on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dcbatmanbte"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dc-batman-bat-tech-edition/id1544139344"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, now updated with a new mission to mark the event.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: The Audio Adventures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mcoDYb"&gt;If you prefer an audio experience,&lt;em&gt; Batman: The Audio Adventures&lt;/em&gt; is available starting today exclusively within HBO Max, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609212/hbo-max-podcast-exclusive-batman-audio-jeffrey-wright"&gt;first of many for the service as it adds on scripted audio content&lt;/a&gt;. Once the episodes are live, you should be able to find them by searching within the app. It’s not an ideal podcast listening experience, and it will be interesting to see how many people actually seek the episodes out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zsKf6"&gt;According to a press release, it’s written by Dennis McNicholas with inspiration from &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; and the 1960s TV show. Jeffrey Wright voices Batman, Rosario Dawson is Catwoman, and John Leguizamo appears as The Riddler, while other notable appearances include Chris Parnell, Kenan Thompson, Alan Tudyk, and others. A companion 80-page comic will be released in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is an excellent value at $250</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Lenovo Chromebook Duet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hABw1ZfO89COmRWce5XvpYcup7s=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829444/mchin_200512_4018_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a capable 2-in-1 that comes with kickstand and keyboard | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PALB0b"&gt;Labor Day is in the rearview and the kids are back in school, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still save some nice coin on a versatile Chromebook offering a great value for tackling homework or everyday tasks. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;one of our top picks across all Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; — not just budget options — is currently $50 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751386006446530546#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The 2-in-1 normally punches above its weight class at full price, but with this added discount it may just be one of the best contenders around for light tasks while on the go or general needs at home as a secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLehW"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model with a bigger OLED panel is coming soon&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be clocking in at a much higher price point of $430 and up. For now, the Duet’s 10.1-inch display with 1920 x 1200 resolution offers adequate real estate thanks to its 16:10 aspect ratio. We wish the screen was a bit brighter, but the Duet makes up for it with huge battery life and overall solid performance. Just be sure to pair your Bluetooth headphones, as there is no headphone jack here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NAPzjv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8HCm"&gt;If you’re in need of a charger, Aukey’s selling its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower%2Fproducts%2Faukey-omnia-mix3-90w-3-port-pd-charger-pa-b6s-white%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22661176%2Flenovo-chromebook-duet-aukey-omnia-charger-amazon-kindle-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-port Omnia 90-watt PD Charger (PA-B6S)&lt;/a&gt; for nearly half off for a limited time (without a charging cable). Normally $56, you can currently buy it for $30 when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;MIX3 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vANZm"&gt;The compact charging brick is 20 percent smaller than Apple’s official 87-watt counterpart, making it easier to carry while you’re traveling. It also comes with one USB-A and two USB-C ports, meaning you can charge multiple devices at the same time so long as you don’t mind reduced charging speeds. It’s not fast enough to supply full-speed charging to a 16-inch MacBook Pro — that requires Apple’s 96-watt Power Adapter, after all — but it should provide quick power for most USB-C devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5HjdiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10739723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RlERzv"&gt;In what is quickly becoming a common occurrence, Amazon is now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Kindle&amp;amp;i=amazon-devices&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;linkId=df992652fd31574c9348c1ff754cf4cf&amp;amp;tag=toysj-20&amp;amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting several Kindle models&lt;/a&gt;, including the entry-level Amazon Kindle. Released in 2019, the 10th-gen e-reader remains the cheapest model in the Kindle lineup, normally selling for $90. Today, however, you can pick up the ad-supported 8GB configuration in either black or white for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b6Rjg"&gt;Unlike its predecessor, the 2019 model is more comfortable to hold and comes with a built-in front light, as well as support for Bluetooth headphones. However, if you have a little bit of extra cash to spare, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we recommend picking up&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; for a more enjoyable reading experience. The ad-supported Paperwhite normally starts at $130 but has been on sale for the past week for $85. For the extra $25, however, you get a device with superior screen resolution and a waterproof build. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Amazon Kindle (2019) review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although it’s not the best price we’ve seen on the Android tablet, it’s still an excellent entertainment device for the price, one with a vibrant display and great speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="jWzbIM"&gt;The direct-to-consumer Chinese company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiido.com%2Fpages%2Four-story&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22662233%2Ffiido-x-electric-bike-test-ride-foldable-price-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;founded in 2016&lt;/a&gt; thinks the Fiido X greatly improves upon the D11. “All the cons on D11 are disappeared,” is how the e-bike was pitched to me, even as the price was boosted to $1,298. That’s about $300 more than the D11 which, at first glance, seems justified: generic parts used on budget e-bikes are currently in short supply globally, and the Fiido X has a very long list of improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT7QOw"&gt;Namely, the Fiido X has a lighter, more visually striking magnesium frame that lacks the thick ugly welds found on the D11. The X also features a better folding mechanism, new torque sensor that promises more intuitive and efficient power delivery, an integrated keyless lock to prevent the saddle and battery from getting stolen, and numerous other improvements both big and small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAzkpL"&gt;So let me start by saying, wow, what a difference a year makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SR1ExGRVt8MlXt2HhNGH-_fjrLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833907/verge_DSC_6221_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fiido X folds down nice and compactly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uBewaH"&gt;Fiido claims to have sold more than 300,000 e-bikes globally. But it’s easy to sell a crap-load of e-bikes when support is a distant concern (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFkoKO"&gt;The Fiido X is available in three models: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GNIC48"&gt;The 17kg (37.5 pounds) Fiido X with hydraulic brakes, 417.6Wh battery, and 250W motor for $1,298.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xCgauh"&gt;The 16.7kg (36.8 pounds) Fiido X Lite with disc brakes, smaller 208.8Wh battery, and 250W motor that’s $1,098.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4BuyOz"&gt;The 17.5kg (38.6 pounds) Fiido X (US) with hydraulic brakes, 417.6Wh battery, and beefier 350W motor also for $1,298.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="AUnBDd"&gt;The Fiido X and X Lite have top speeds of 25km/h (16mph) while the Fiido X (US) model has a top speed of 32km/h (20mph). None of the e-bikes have a throttle — they are pedal-assist only — but Fiido says it will sell a mod kit later for owners wanting to add a throttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UClQR"&gt;The Fiido D11, like many of the company’s e-bikes, can be “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBVkMUgiP-Q"&gt;unlocked&lt;/a&gt;” for even more speed, and the Fiido X is likely no different. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Ffiido-x-130km-folding-electric-bike%23%2Ffaq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22662233%2Ffiido-x-electric-bike-test-ride-foldable-price-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Indiegogo FAQ&lt;/a&gt; even notes that the Fiido X is a bike capable of “more than 40km/h” but has been capped to meet safety regulations for each region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrtXxi"&gt;I was sent the Fiido X model to my home in Amsterdam to test. But what I received is a late-stage prototype, so it’ll be slightly different from what Indiegogo backers receive (I’ll note these differences along the way). So, this isn’t a review, but it is a check on the company’s claims before you send Fiido’s Indiegogo campaign more than $1,000 of your hard-earned cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="VqcHzj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwZvLi"&gt;First impressions say a lot, and the improvements made by Fiido were obvious as soon as I opened the box. It was shipped with noticeably less packing material in the box than last year’s D11, yet it still made its way around the world unscathed. After a bare minimum of assembly (unfold, attach pedals, insert battery, and give all the screws a tighten), I was up and riding within about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Yl0l"&gt;The Fiido X, like the D11, smartly integrates its large (for a foldable) 417.6Wh battery into the seat post. The Fiido X improves upon the design greatly by eliminating the unsightly pigtail cable. The entire seat and battery assembly can also now be locked into place to prevent them from being stolen. But instead of a key which can be lost, the Fiido X features a number pad installed directly onto the frame just below the integrated rear light. The number pad has the brute-force aesthetic of a Soviet missile silo but gets the job done regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMqidP"&gt;The seat and battery assembly locks into place as soon as it’s inserted. It can be unlocked by entering the passcode only you know, allowing the battery to be taken inside to charge. The seat height can be adjusted via a new clamping mechanism that also serves to replace the pigtail cable to electrically couple the battery to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISuTt2"&gt;Turning on the Fiido X also requires a passcode now, as well as a separate button on the battery, for some reason. It won’t prevent bike thieves from riding away under their own leg strength, but at least they won’t benefit from the pedal-assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvtC2BfzoCS8UBvFhAbC8r824zc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833901/Fiido_x_up_down.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery integrated into the seat tube continues to be an impact risk for riders under about 6 feet tall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DpFrVQ"&gt;The seat-post battery on my Fiido X prototype, however, is still an impact risk for shorter riders, just like it was on the D11. The battery can be shoved so far down that it extends well beyond the frame and crankset. I’m 183cm (six feet) tall, which means the seat (and battery) are high enough to still be protected by the frame, but only just. Fiido says the X supports riders from 155cm (five feet) to 200cm (six feet, five inches). But anyone under six feet tall will need to be comfortable having that battery jutting out the bottom of the frame if they want their toes to touch the ground. Fiido tells me that the battery on production Fiido X bikes will not extend beyond the protective crankset (but still outside of the frame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF5CuE"&gt;The new hinge on the folding magnesium frame is another welcome improvement. It opens easily, allowing the bike to fold in half without the excessive resistance felt on the D11 e-bike I reviewed. The handlebar also folds down quickly allowing the bike to be broken down into a very compact package suitable for hoisting onto a train or into the trunk of a car. Unfortunately, none of the folded components lock into place like more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19040479/folding-e-bike-review-price-weight"&gt;Brompton&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21211827/gocycle-gxi-review-price-foldable-electric-bike"&gt;GoCycle foldables&lt;/a&gt; making the 17kg (37.5 pounds) Fiido X a bit unwieldy to carry or trolly along on one wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ecNxgXbEpMZnKkGmiiU-hx8lwvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833894/verge_DSC_6266_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fiido X easily fits inside one of VW’s smallest cars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtJt4p"&gt;After charging my battery to full, it was ready to ride. Steering is responsive but lives right on the edge of twitchy. The torque sensor makes the Fiido X much more intuitive to ride than the D11’s cheaper cadence sensor. Press down on a pedal from a standstill and the assist is felt almost immediately. On flat surfaces I was able to easily cruise along in the lowest power setting (one of three). The Fiido X is fitted with seven gears, which is about four too many for riding an e-bike on the eternally flat roads of the Netherlands. In the rolling dunes by the North Sea, I was more comfortable riding in the second power setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPZHHC"&gt;The 250W Aikema rear-hub motor is much quieter than its predecessor but also provides more power on hills, allowing me to easily climb the steepest incline I could find in the third power setting. Although that hill would be small by San Francisco standards, the D11 struggled with that same incline just a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVZvvT"&gt;One oddity I noticed is the speed limit on the display maxes out at 25km/h (about 15.5mph), despite going much faster than that while riding downhill in top gear (my GPS watch said I was riding at 29.5km/h or roughly 18mph). Fiido says this will be fixed with the production units. The D11 speedometer also failed to register the correct speed, so we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVc7qc"&gt;The Fiido X has a claimed range of up to 130km (80 miles). I didn’t conduct a full range test on the prototype, but that type of range is certainly possible on a throttle-less pedal-assisted bike ridden on flat terrain on the lowest power setting — though it’s unlikely in day-to-day usage. For reference, Fiido claimed the D11 could go up to 100km before a recharge and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507889/fiido-d11-chinese-e-bike-review-price-us-europe-250w"&gt;I managed 49km (30 miles)&lt;/a&gt; during my range test over mostly flat bike paths using the throttle about 90 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBjFUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10740566"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R8uc4p"&gt;Some other observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BA9TZ7"&gt;Fiido says the Fiido X should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be ridden in “heavy rain” as its IP54 rating leaves the bike’s electronics susceptible to anything more aggressive than splashing water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Almllk"&gt;Weight has been reduced by almost 3kg (6.6 pounds), which makes the Fiido X the same weight as the Brompton e-bike, even though the Fiido X rolls on larger 20-inch tires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eZ2C7i"&gt;The new leather saddle is a bit more comfortable, but the Fiido graphics rubbed off after a few days of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9irWe2"&gt;Same hard grips as D11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mkKiHy"&gt;My test e-bike lacked fenders, but those will come standard with the production e-bike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FcMajA"&gt;Display visibility washes out in direct sunlight, but it’s not something you need to reference frequently, or at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MKmr0A"&gt;Cables are better managed and the front and rear lights are now part of the frame assembly for a cleaner overall look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ojyqwc"&gt;The seven-hour charge time is very slow compared to similar capacity batteries from more expensive e-bike makers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ukUhuX"&gt;Kickstand has been moved from the center to the rear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyDpQA9QX0-GkJm-Le6TAcsweDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833919/verge_DSC_6161_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fiido X has integrated front and rear lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJiSoC"&gt;Support is always going to be an issue with these direct-to-consumer e-bikes. The relatively low purchase price is certainly attractive, but what happens when something goes wrong and you need to make a warranty claim against China-based Fiido? It helps that Fiido uses off-the-shelf parts that can be purchased from the company’s online store and replaced by any bike shop. That’s assuming the parts are in stock at a time when generic bicycle components are in incredibly short supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNmbH"&gt;Fiido tells me that it’s preparing to open maintenance centers in the EU, US, and other regions “in the near future.” The company says it currently has four after-sales service centers based in the UK, Ireland, Spain, and Italy. By 2022, Fiido says that it wants to build at least five service centers in the USA and Canada, and at least two in countries like the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany — other EU countries would have one. Those are laudable goals, but you should never buy a product today based on a promise for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VtnQWT"&gt;The Fiido X is an impressive follow-up to the D11 that addresses most but not all of its shortcomings. And &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Ffiido-x-130km-folding-electric-bike%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22662233%2Ffiido-x-electric-bike-test-ride-foldable-price-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at $1,298&lt;/a&gt;, the Fiido X is far less expensive than any folding electric bike offered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357905/gocycle-g4-g4i-g4i-plus-prices-folding-e-bikes-specs"&gt;GoCycle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19040479/folding-e-bike-review-price-weight"&gt;Brompton&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22621388/hummingbird-folding-electric-bike-gen-2-lightest-ebike-range-specs-price"&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/a&gt;. They won’t service your bike at your home or office like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22583925/radrover-rad-power-bikes-integrated-battery-price"&gt;RadPower&lt;/a&gt; will, and it can’t be tracked down and returned if stolen like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392495/vanmoof-powerbank-range-extender-2021-s3-x3-differences"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, but not everyone needs premium features that come at a premium price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s smartphone gimbal is now a selfie stick, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3Z3PFPKCTObUUuGfbC_Ywlnlmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829236/DJI_OM_5_Lifestyle2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="asFT8M"&gt;DJI just released the Osmo Mobile 5, a new smartphone gimbal, which includes a telescoping selfie stick (okay, sure, an “extension rod”) built right into the handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sATMHi"&gt;The OM 5 retains the same foldable design principle as its predecessors but with some minor changes. The gimbal is slightly smaller and lighter this year. And eagle-eyed users will notice the angle of the handle is more acute than before to accommodate for the 8.4-inch selfie stick. I worry it might make it less comfortable, but we won’t know until we actually check it out in person. There’s also a new button on the handle, which will let you quickly access some of the core OM 5 features. But with the changes in design, the battery life is taking a huge hit. While the OM 4 gimbal was rated for 15 hours, the OM 5 rating shrinks to six hours and 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGUg_bXzbnqf4CpCRWLYfm7zKA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832161/DJI_OM_5_Lifestyle7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8.4-inch built-in extension rod helps you capture footage from more interesting perspectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7mmBDg"&gt;When DJI introduced the OM 4, a standout feature was the pair of magnetic mounts that made attaching your phone to the gimbal effortless. But the mounts required extra effort to work with a larger than usual phone, especially if said phone had a case on it. Now DJI is upgrading the magnetic clamp so it stretches out even further. And no, just like last year, the magnets still aren’t compatible with Apple’s proprietary MagSafe magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zBplz"&gt;OM 5 also comes with improved gimbal motors and has added a new intelligent feature — Shotguides. The OM 5 scans your surroundings and gives you up to 30 sets of tips and directions on shooting videos with this gimbal. Once you have filmed all the recommended clips, it will auto-edit them into one polished video in DJI’s Mimo app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0Bo8pq2O4tWyTs5Tk3tEvyXLH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832173/DJI_OM_5_Function4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DJI is now selling an optional magnetic clamp with built-in lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbk3dY"&gt;The rest of DJI’s other intelligent tracking features are also getting a performance upgrade. Active Track 4.0 now has improved facial recognition and facial tracking, which results in much more responsive performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux1fen"&gt;All of the other preprogrammed shooting modes from the OM 4 can also be found on the OM 5 — the Hitchcockian dolly zoom, creative CloneMe Panoramas, and my personal favorite, SpinShot. Plus other standard modes we’ve seen before such as Hyperlapse, Timelapse, and Motionlapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPJ60n"&gt;DJI’s Osmo Mobile 5 will be available in 2 colors — Athens gray and sunset white. DJI is also selling a new optional $59 accessory, the DJI Fill Light Phone Clamp, which looks like a standard magnetic clamp, but with built-in lights to help brighten up your selfies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BipsKY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10739377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZiM4j"&gt;With the release of the OM 5, the OM 4 is being renamed to OM SE, which is the same gimbal as last year, including the same old 15-hour battery life but with the upgraded magnetic clamp, all for $119. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esvg6c"&gt;Osmo Mobile 5 is available right now for $159, which is $10 more than the Osmo Mobile 4 and about $30 more than the Osmo Mobile 3 cost at launch. The OM 5 comes in one standard package with a ring holder, clamp, tripod, wrist strap, and pouch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOsD1e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 8th, 9:57AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; DJI’s press release incorrectly stated the price of the Fill Light Phone Clamp as $79. DJI contacted us after publication to note the correct price is $59.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BF7flu"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Today’s announcement is a bit of a milestone, however. Although there is still the smattering of small and coming-soon updates, the bigger change is that Gmail is getting a redesign that reveals its true nature in Google’s eyes: the central hub for every Google communication app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8ERET"&gt;To begin, Google is adding the ability to “ring” another Google user with Google Meet — but inside the Gmail mobile app, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; inside the Meet app. When the feature rolls out and turns on, your Gmail app will be able to be called just like any other VOIP app (in addition to being able to join Google Meet meetings). Google says the standalone Meet app will get the same ability to place calls, not just create group meetings, at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM6Lc7"&gt;That Gmail was the first place Google thought to put its calling feature reveals how important Gmail has become to the larger changes happening within Google Workspace. Google has not been shy about leveraging Gmail’s popularity to drive adoption of its other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTAUKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gmail has become Google’s take on Outlook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="skm4yu"&gt;Now, Gmail is essentially Google’s equivalent to Microsoft’s Outlook. It’s a central hub for multiple services. Outlook is Microsoft’s hub for email, calendar, and contacts; Gmail is Google’s hub for email, one-on-one chats, group chats, videoconferencing, and now calls. The email part of Gmail is just one tab in a group of four, next to Chat, Spaces, and Meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="if1o7i"&gt;“Spaces” is Google’s rebranding of “Rooms,” a Slack-alike product that offers group chats. With the rename, Google’s making it easier to find Spaces within a company by making them discoverable to search (as an option) and also finally adding full support for threaded messages. As with other group chat apps, threads will appear in an extra column on the right-hand side. (For those keeping count, that means a Spaces user could have up to five columns of different information on their screen at once.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqwJyJ"&gt;Google says users will be able to hide the tabs they don’t use, as before, and that the redesign is rolling out to enterprise users first, starting today. After that, it will start to appear in Gmail for regular consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO8jYt"&gt;As for the smaller updates, Google Calendar will now let you RSVP to a meeting invite with an indication of your location. Google will finally launch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;so-called “Companion mode” feature&lt;/a&gt; this November. It’s the system that has you log into a meeting on your laptop alongside the main room’s AV system, muted by default so there’s not an embarrassing audio feedback loop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4yRCvVuxfzF-wDRFcz1J5uJCYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832704/Series_One_Desk_27_on_desk.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cZeA9M"&gt;Finally, Google is expanding the “Series One” line of Google Meet-compatible hardware. Unlike “Made by Google” hardware like the Pixel, Series One devices are made by other companies to look like they fit in with Google’s design aesthetic and work primarily with Google’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULTuYW"&gt;To me, the more interesting device is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22425694"&gt;Series One Desk 27&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a touchscreen display designed primarily to serve as a Google Meet videoconferencing station, but it also has a simple USB-C port and can serve as an external monitor for a laptop. When you plug in, you can use its soundbar and 5-megapixel camera with whatever video conference app you like, as well. Google says it has an Edge TPU (a custom, Google processor) for listening to Hey Google commands, but otherwise it uses a standard Intel chip for its main functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRrGrp"&gt;It’s definitely a device meant more for corporate spaces than consumer’s homes and has a price to match: $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BurSoHGvgnU-h8oLAa5xpNFd2VE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832706/Series_One_Board_65_in_team_room.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EcrX4K"&gt;There’s also the Series One Panel 65, a TV that’s also able to take stylus input and work a little like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14873358/google-jamboard-hands-on-photos-4999-collaborative-whiteboard"&gt;Google’s own Jamboard&lt;/a&gt;. Google says both will run on Chrome OS and are “all-in-one meeting devices,” but beyond that, we don’t have a ton of specs. The devices are made by &lt;a href="https://www.avocor.com/"&gt;Avocor&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a bunch of other custom meeting devices. It will launch in 2022. Pricing is not available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cM339"&gt;Google is partnering with Cisco to ensure that hardware designed for Google Meet will be able to dial into Webex meetings and that hardware designed for Webex will be able to dial into Google Meet. As for Zoom, there’s “nothing to announce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwEEYB"&gt;There’s been more work put into Google Workspace in the past year than seems to have gone into it in the several years before that, the vast majority of it focused on communication. That’s great news for companies and consumers who use all of Workspace’s various apps. But for those of us who just want Gmail to keep being just an email app, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
