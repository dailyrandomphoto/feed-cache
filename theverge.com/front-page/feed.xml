    <title>Valve says supporting the Steam Deck with BattlEye anti-cheat is as easy as an email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exe83jiNRlBiaBe-Jvc03jwaiKw=/138x0:1200x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70115024/steam_deck_dev_kit_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woTbCC"&gt;We knew from the beginning that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s upcoming $400 Steam Deck handheld&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t play every Steam game perfectly out of the box. It runs Windows games on Linux using the Proton compatibility layer, and some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that, historically, hasn’t worked with Proton. But on Friday, Valve revealed that this should no longer be a problem for BattlEye, one of the biggest anti-cheat vendors out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tF4sPS"&gt;“BattlEye on Proton integration has reached a point where all a developer needs to do is reach out BattlEye to enable it for their title. No additional work is required by the developer besides that communication,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966"&gt;writes Valve&lt;/a&gt;, adding that &lt;em&gt;Mount &amp;amp; Blade II Bannerlord&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ark: Survival Evolved &lt;/em&gt;are already up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew3VKG"&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;a single email&lt;/em&gt; should be good enough to make some of the biggest unsupported games playable on Steam Deck at a basic level — though developers will obviously also want to make things gamepad- and touchscreen-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733408/steam-deck-compatibility-verified-pc-gaming-valve"&gt;to get Valve’s official “verified” checkmark.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igOBgO"&gt;So what does that mean for the biggest BattlEye games that don’t currently run on Steam Deck, including &lt;em&gt;DayZ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt;? Will Ubisoft, Krafton and Bohemia Interactive send those simple emails? It’s not looking great: they didn’t immediately respond to our requests for comment today, and they declined to comment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic"&gt;when we reached out to top Steam developers about the Steam Deck last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Q2SfI"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Steam Deck: a Switch-like portable gaming PC|103274" data-volume-uuid="2d2697872" data-volume-id="103274" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-16" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mglvme"&gt;BattlEye isn’t alone in supporting Proton on behalf of the Steam Deck, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;As we reported in September&lt;/a&gt;, Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) now supports Linux as well, with owner Epic Games announcing that it should take “just a few clicks in the Epic Online Services Developer Portal” to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPljUc"&gt;But for whatever reason, top game developers aren’t eager to voice their support. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic"&gt;Only four out of 15 studios we contacted&lt;/a&gt; gave us a yes despite the “just a few clicks” promise — and EAC owner Epic Games itself, amusingly, was not among them. Epic would not commit its subsidiary Mediatonic’s &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; (which uses EAC) to the platform, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;previously declined to comment on whether &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(which uses BattlEye) would be available on Steam Deck, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFyG13"&gt;While Sony hasn’t committed to supporting the Steam Deck with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750577/sony-playstation-pc-games-label-steam"&gt;its burgeoning slate of PC titles&lt;/a&gt;, PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida did tweet that &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; runs on the Deck. That won’t be a surprise to the ProtonDB community, which &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1151640"&gt;currently gives &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition &lt;/em&gt;a “Gold” rating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0NiKG3"&gt;

&lt;p id="uShVin"&gt;Former PlayStation exclusive &lt;em&gt;Detroit: Become Human&lt;/em&gt; apparently works on Steam Deck as well: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjlMTf"&gt;The Steam Deck is currently slated to ship to the first batch of early adopters in December, though many day-one buyers won’t get their preordered handhelds until Q1 2022 or later. If you were to reserve one today, Valve suggests you might not get it until after the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pet Portraits lets you find art look-alikes for your furry friend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQvCFpeGpqBI5lYrvx55AUnyyLc=/119x0:1397x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114823/Screen_Shot_2021_11_08_at_17.16.29.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igtXNz"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/paws-meet-machine-learning-pet-portraits/"&gt;has announced an exciting new feature&lt;/a&gt; for its Arts and Culture app: the ability to search through thousands of paintings to find a look-alike for your pet. The company says its “Pet Portraits” feature will let you take a picture of a dog, cat, fish, bird, reptile, horse, or rabbit, and have a machine learning algorithm find pieces of art that feature a similar-looking animal. The process only takes a few seconds, and as a bonus you’ll be able to tap on the pieces of artwork to learn more about them. You can even save a video slideshow of your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzHgUi"&gt;I tried out Pet Portraits on my cat, Aslan, and the results were mixed — while the app was able to generate a beautiful (okay, mostly tan) color palette based on his fur, most of the art doppelgängers (as Google puts it) didn’t end up looking much like him at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KImioo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They most just look like cats to me... &lt;a href="https://t.co/7vflcuCly9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7vflcuCly9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1457878281982648326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNGgnDoNiBB9d5IJ_ad5ELcl5iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997386/IMG_3130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The facial expression is similar, but the coloring is not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rywfdQNbChDglHN1B5upYFtrk-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997385/IMG_3124.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, this one’s spot on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N5zFnv"&gt;It also missed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_-_The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe.jpg"&gt;the most obvious look-alike for my boy&lt;/a&gt; (though in its defense I don’t think Google knows my cat’s name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ORjMy1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10853830"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xDd6fg"&gt;The tool also lets you upload photos instead of using the live camera, which is good news if your pet is a bit photo-shy or if you want to experiment with different angles. You can also try it out with your co-worker’s pets — perhaps use the results to make fun of them in the replies to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1456284300391895041"&gt;their fourth puppy tweet this week&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5LT3RjTK9zT3mna9Fjk_iz11nw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997493/IMG_3138.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Frank yields some much better matches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktg41d"&gt;While I didn’t get great results, it’s still a lot of fun to play around with. Plus, you’re like me and don’t get to see what your pet would look like painted by Monet or da Vinci, the app also has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204498/art-transfer-google-artists-style-photos"&gt;a filter that lets you apply a famous artist’s style to your pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lMKCQe_blo5dZgaAI8DuPloyPWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997472/IMG_3133.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what I wish I’d found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BoDFhO"&gt;If you want to try it out on your own pet, you can download the Google Arts and Culture app on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-arts-culture/id1050970557"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. The app also has a feature where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900392/art-selfie-facial-match-app-google-top-of-charts"&gt;you can compare a picture of yourself to portraits&lt;/a&gt; — perhaps, if the stars align, you can use the features in conjunction to find a piece of artwork that features look-alikes of you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your pet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_US_EBF21_P1_GW_Desk_DealsSingle_DOTD_ENES=&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=3488afaa-3745-41ec-bed9-8c643eff58e9&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JWNIH&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=2DJTCZEMSEHW2K3CCY8Y&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=gdIC3&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=652b3660-a90a-45ff-b04c-3e93a23460c4&amp;amp;ref_=pd_gw_unk"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in white for $240. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,798&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $1,398&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyI5ia"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is a smart 4K monitor that acts like a TV for your PC, one you can mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $520, its best price to date, with a solar-powered remote control. The monitor can stream HDR10 content from popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2. It also supports Google Assistant and Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j22lU8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vn9Au6"&gt;Amazon has temporarily knocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Inspire-Fitness-Tracker-Included/dp/B08DFDP1TR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 off the Fitbit Inspire 2&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the sticker price down to $60, a price we last saw during a flash sale event in July. The Inspire 2 is the budget-friendly option in the Fitbit lineup, offering only the necessities at a sensible price point. This tracker can monitor your sleep and heart rate and can last up to 10 days without recharging. While it can provide you with notifications from your phone, it can’t control music playback and doesn’t have built-in GPS or support for virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa. The Inspire 2 does come packaged with a pair of different-sized bands as well, though, and a free year of Fitbit Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D1qlnc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WplKkW"&gt;Both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $40 right now instead of $60, which is a good deal on what we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;recently praised&lt;/a&gt; as an amazing action game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $190 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $234 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding other perks in addition to the six-month subscription to HBO Max. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is selling the popular action cam for $450 instead. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which allows you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt;, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KJNFBG"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target RedCard holders can save an additional 5 percent while enjoying free shipping, and the store will be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69Dp0C"&gt;Target is currently offering Black Friday deals &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/ZdB3AQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL, and more&lt;/a&gt;. The store is also offering the same discount on various sizes of the LG C1 and Samsung’s The Frame as Amazon, and including a six-month subscription to HBO Max as well. However, as we mentioned before, Target RedCard members are also eligible for a five percent discount, which means they could buy the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816%3Fclkid%3D64ecedacN58e711ea9b2c42010a246e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch LG C1 for $1,045&lt;/a&gt; instead of the discounted $1,100 Amazon currently offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmYUbz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lV9ukd"&gt;Alternatively, Target RedCard members can pick up the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/9WOv9y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version of The Frame&lt;/a&gt;, which has an MSRP of $1,300, for $1,138 instead of the discounted $1,198. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYKZW4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is currently selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $200. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2XWmQV"&gt;Target is still offering up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9QDKd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles. The deal was originally set to expire on November 7th, though, it remains active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;The retailer is also selling a silver version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the aforementioned video game deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going to be on sale at Walmart for $140&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k2O7Rx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DC2Mly"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zAwjwU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC boss says company is exploring how to accept Shiba Inu along with other crypto </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_j6x7JQlLn7uwqf6tT9jg75yeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114547/acastro_210813_1777_amc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rQPlvk"&gt;AMC boss Adam Aron said today that the theater chain is exploring how it can accept Shiba Inu in addition to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. In addition, AMC is evidently exploring its own cryptocurrency, which would truly cement the company as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465198/amc-meme-stock-popcorn-wsb"&gt;king of the memestocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sa2tc"&gt;That AMC appears to be flirting with the idea of accepting (another) meme currency in exchange for actual goods and services isn’t entirely surprising. AMC was effectively rescued midway through the pandemic by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;meme stock Reddit traders&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron has been leaning heavily into the company’s relationship with these shareholders ever since. Hearing about AMC’s crypto ambitions has not only come to be expected during the company’s meetings with shareholders, it’s practically ensured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGu2F"&gt;Aron shared a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1454023849528410115"&gt;Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; last month asking his followers whether the company should expand the accepted cryptocurrencies that can be used to purchase AMC gift cards through BitPay. Aron wrote at the time that the company’s “IT group is writing code so that soon we can accept online payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin among others,” and asked whether the list of accepted currencies should be extended to Shiba Inu, itself a meme coin response to Dogecoin. The response from respondents was overwhelmingly, and unsurprisingly given the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;shareholder base&lt;/a&gt;, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEiwtB"&gt;The company previously announced it will accept Bitcoin for things like concessions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;before year’s end&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron said during the company’s shareholders meeting this week that AMC is on track to hit that goal. Aron further said that AMC is now examining how it can evolve the way that it accepts crypto, including potentially launching its own and partnering with theaters on offering NFTs for blockbuster film premieres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyKdog"&gt;“I can confirm today that we have been exploring with third parties over the past few months both how we can accept cryptocurrency and if it is feasible for AMC to consider even launching our own cryptocurrency,” Aron said. “Similarly, I can confirm to you today that we are now in conversation with multiple major Hollywood studios about the concept of joint venturing commemorative NFTs related to major film titles that show in our theaters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQaANm"&gt;Some of these talks are “preliminary in nature,” Aron said, adding that regulatory factors could impact its strategies. When asked about the company’s plans to bring Shiba Inu into its cryptocurrency fold, the AMC boss didn’t miss a beat in admitting he’s taking cues from shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27gkec"&gt;“There’s just been a tidal wave of inbound messaging to our company, and to me personally, that we ought to get much more active in the sphere of cryptocurrency and that there was real opportunity for AMC,” Aron said. When the company made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; about its plans to accept Bitcoin for payments before the end of the year, meme stonk shareholders evidently flooded Aron’s DMs to express interest in the company accepting other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkAgZT"&gt;Currently, the company is on track to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash before the end of the year. Aron said that the company believes it’ll be able to accept Dogecoin by the first quarter of next year. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, is “the next one on our cryptocurrency hit parade.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An alleged member of the REvil ransomware gang has been arrested in Poland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9lAl2AOM7ak2eozlUQXW3DrdtzE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114194/acastro_170621_1777_0006_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QyXig3"&gt;The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ukrainian-arrested-and-charged-ransomware-attack-kaseya"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the arrest and indictment of an alleged member of the REvil hacking group, linked to ransomware attacks on IT firm Kaseya, an Apple supplier, and more. According to the department, Ukrainian national Yaroslav Vasinskyi is facing extradition to the US after Polish authorities detained him in October and after the US indicted him for cybercrimes in August, as revealed by a now-unsealed court document. The arrest, along with the government seizing assets it says are linked to REvil’s operations, is another step in the fight against ransomware, which has been a growing issue for US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzng9I"&gt;The DOJ also says it has seized $6.1 million in assets from the FTX crypto trading exchange, allegedly linked to REvil ransomware. The money belonged to Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, who has also been indicted for allegedly working with REvil to attack corporate and government targets. Polyanin was also indicted in August, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/revil-ransomware-attack-charges/index.html"&gt;though &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the DOJ report he hasn’t been caught yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Me6B8x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;REvil would destroy company’s backups before encrypting their data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NruAWk"&gt;You can read both indictments below, which detail REvil’s alleged process of breaking into computer networks, gaining control over them, and then stealing companies’ data, locking the rightful owners out by encrypting data and deleting any backups. Companies would, however, be able to gain access back to the data if they paid a ransom — otherwise, their data could be sold or posted to the web. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;happened to Apple supplier Quanta&lt;/a&gt;, whose documents detailing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple’s new MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; were posted to REvil’s blog well before any official information was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGxSMF"&gt;The indictments don’t explicitly say what roles Vasinskyi and Polyanin allegedly played in the attacks, only accusing them of being involved and working with other team members to carry out attacks. The Department of Justice says that Vasinskyi and Polyanin could each face over 100 years in prison if convicted on all counts levied against them. Two other people involved with REvil were also arrested. The government &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0471"&gt;is also willing to spend big on catching more&lt;/a&gt; alleged members — it’s offering an up to $10 million reward for info that leads to the arrest of REvil leadership and up to $5 million for info about people trying to work for the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nCzqO3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US is turning its attention toward ransomware as it becomes a more expensive problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8EMhX"&gt;The arrest and hunt for REvil operators is just part of the government’s work against the ransomware outfit — reports started surfacing in October that the FBI, Secret Service, Cyber Command &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740239/revil-ransomware-hacking-fbi-cyber-command-secret-service-down"&gt;had taken REvil’s website offline&lt;/a&gt; using some of the group’s own tactics against it. The Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;named it in a report&lt;/a&gt; as one of the biggest ransomware groups when measuring by payout size.&lt;/p&gt;

President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/08/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-todays-counter-ransomware-actions/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the government is using its “full strength” to “disrupt malicious cyber activity and actors” and that the arrests and financial seizures were part of its efforts to “hold accountable those that threaten our security.” Acting US Attorney Chad E. Meacham said that the Justice Department “will delve into the darkest corners of the internet and the furthest reaches of the globe to track down cyber criminals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A pair of PS5 hacks could be the first steps towards jailbreaking Sony’s latest console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giV4ELoaT9ddCSi0aUt9AuMqieA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114154/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UI4Hd"&gt;Hackers may have just made some big strides towards possibly jailbreaking the PlayStation 5 over the weekend, with the hacking group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625"&gt;Fail0verflow claiming&lt;/a&gt; to have managed to obtain PS5 root keys allowing them to decrypt the console’s firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSjSC4"&gt;Additionally, Andy Nguyen (a security engineer at Google who’s better known under his handle, theflow0) &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/theflow0/status/1457362920501829636"&gt;managed to access&lt;/a&gt; the PS5’s debug settings menu on a retail PS5 over the weekend, too. Both exploits were spotted by &lt;a href="http://Wololo.net"&gt;Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6hPfa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another one bites the dust   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y1ty93AvaE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y1ty93AvaE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— fail0verflow (@fail0verflow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fail0verflow/status/1457499576676634625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4V3Mlj"&gt;The two exploits are particularly notable due to the level of access they theoretically give to the PS5’s software. Decrypted firmware — which is possible through Fail0verflow’s keys — would potentially allow for hackers to further reverse engineer the PS5 software and potentially develop the sorts of hacks that allowed for things like installing Linux, emulators, or even pirated games on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_Jailbreak"&gt;past Sony consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eajUXZ"&gt;Obviously, Sony is presumably keen to prevent users from doing those sorts of things and will presumably be doing whatever it can to prevent those exploits from reaching a broader audience, in addition to attempting to patch the vulnerabilities there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="InMrRT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5Share?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5Share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/xem0A7i3rC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xem0A7i3rC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Nguyen (@theflow0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theflow0/status/1457362920501829636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzFnN"&gt;For now, the two exploits won’t result in much of a change for PS5 owners — there’s no sudden PS5 jailbreak available today, and neither Nguyen nor Fail0verflow have published the details of their respective hacks — nor is it even clear if they ever will. Nguyen has already said that he has “no plans for disclosure” of his hack, while &lt;a href="http://Wololo.net"&gt;Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt; notes that Fail0verflow held off on publishing its PS4 hacks last console generation until Sony patched things, meaning that it’s possible none of this will lead to concrete changes in the PS5 hacking scene. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll be able to pay for Amazon purchases with Venmo starting in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLEzAsGs07o1SRCwNUiK0Aq5Nco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114109/akrales_170602_1743_0040.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4Wk7H"&gt;If you want to buy anything on Amazon.com, you’ll generally need a credit or debit card — but in 2022, the online retailer will begin accepting Venmo as well. Venmo parent company PayPal &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-customers-will-able-pay-venmo-next-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) during its Q3 earnings call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUVAB"&gt;We’re pretty sure that’s the first third-party payments platform Amazon has embraced in recent memory. You can’t use PayPal itself to buy things on Amazon! (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;a list of the payment methods Amazon does accept&lt;/a&gt; as of today). You might cite Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/amazon-partners-with-affirm"&gt;recent buy-now, pay-later partnership with Affirm&lt;/a&gt;, but that still requires credit. Venmo, by comparison, acts more like a bank account for some mobile users, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213387/venmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking"&gt;complete with a (sometimes expensive) check-cashing feature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7IkRW"&gt;Details on the Amazon partnership are scarce right now, but if you’ve got a US Venmo account, PayPal says you’ll be able to use it to make purchases at both Amazon’s website and its mobile app starting in 2022, and you’ll be able to use either your Venmo balance or a linked bank account to pay. The company didn’t provide a more specific timeframe or any details about how those transactions might work, saying on the earnings call that PayPal was “still working” with Amazon on the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9by0HC"&gt;It’s possible that Amazon will surface it as a full-fledged payment mechanism by offering an entire Pay with Venmo option, or it’s possible it will try to maintain more control by requiring you to integrate Venmo with its own Amazon Wallet. (Maybe you’ll have to deposit Venmo money into your Amazon balance first?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xkw3r"&gt;Venmo, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357246/paypal-buy-with-bitcoin-litecoin-ethereum-crypto-checkout"&gt;like PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392274/venmo-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-hold-bitcoin"&gt;support for popular cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear if that will allow you to effectively purchase Amazon items with cryptocurrency, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNuLnj"&gt;On PayPal’s Q3 earnings call, the company stated that while the PayPal portion is still larger than Venmo, the Venmo business has now grown as large as the entire PayPal US footprint. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic sells 100 tickets to space at higher price after reopening sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8E0yJT5dcbVeCvdQWKojcQYfmXI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114097/1233923008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBzVKV"&gt;Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic says that 100 people purchased more expensive tickets to fly on the company’s suborbital spaceplane after it reopened ticket sales this August. That means that the company has roughly 700 ticket holders now for quick tourist trips to space, about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic is hoping to sell ahead of starting commercial flights of its vehicles. The company announced the news &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;during its third-quarter earnings release out on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxFx3a"&gt;Though Virgin Galactic still has more tickets it aims to sell, the company says the additional sales from this quarter were better than expected. “We’re selling tickets ahead of the pace we planned,” Michael Colglazier, Virgin Galactic’s CEO, said during a presentation on the company’s third-quarter earnings. “The pricing strategy we announced last quarter has been well received.” Tickets were offered to a group of individuals who’d put down a refundable $1,000 deposit, showing their interest in flying with Virgin Galactic. Early next year, the company will open up ticket sales more broadly to people who inquired about flight information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwhnjZ"&gt;Virgin Galactic reopened ticket sales just a month after the company successfully flew its founder, billionaire Richard Branson, to the edge of space and back on the company’s primary spaceplane, called &lt;em&gt;VSS Unity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in July. Taking off from Spaceport America in New Mexico, Branson flew with two test pilots and three other passengers, reaching a height of more than 53 miles before returning back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bt01s4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic hoped to sell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WVKWv9"&gt;The flight was a major spectacle, hastily scheduled nine days before rival Blue Origin flew &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; founder, Jeff Bezos, to the edge of space and back. And at the time, it was seemingly a major success. But in September, a story in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;revealed that Branson’s flight had actually deviated from its approved flight path when it returned to Earth. The Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654516/spaceshiptwo-richard-branson-faa-virgin-galactic"&gt;temporarily grounded Virgin Galactic as the agency investigated&lt;/a&gt; the incident but ultimately resolved the issue and cleared the company to fly again in mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zSEP"&gt;Before the investigation came to light, Virgin Galactic decided to reopen ticket sales, arguing that there had been a “surge in consumer interest following” Branson’s flight. The company opted to list tickets at $450,000, significantly higher than the $250,000 price tag during Virgin Galactic’s initial ticketing round years ago. To secure a ticket, customers had to put down a $150,000 deposit, $25,000 of which was non-refundable, according to Colglazier. Additionally, Virgin Galactic had been targeting to fly its next mission with people in September — a flight called Unity 23 that will carry three members of the Italian Air Force. It’s meant to be Virgin Galactic’s first revenue-generating mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxYUdV"&gt;But in early September, Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Provides-Update-on-Unity-23-Test-Flight/default.aspx"&gt;announced a delay to Unity 23&lt;/a&gt; after a third-party supplier “flagged a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control actuation system” that it supplies to the company. Virgin Galactic opted to put the flight on hold and do inspections of its fleet to see if the defect was present in its vehicles. Along with &lt;em&gt;VSS Unity&lt;/em&gt;, Virgin Galactic rolled out another vehicle, &lt;em&gt;VSS Imagine, &lt;/em&gt;in March, and the company is working on another vehicle called &lt;em&gt;VSS Inspire&lt;/em&gt;. Then in October, the company announced that it would not resume commercial flight operations &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Begins-Planned-Vehicle-Enhancement-and-Modification-Period-Unity-23-Test-Flight-Rescheduled-to-Follow-Completion-of-This-Program/default.aspx"&gt;until the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;, more than a year after Branson’s flight, due to a comprehensive enhancement of the company’s vehicles. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;VSS Imagine&lt;/em&gt; will not attempt its first glide flight until early 2023. That means Virgin Galactic’s customers could be waiting a while before they see space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r094OE"&gt;In its earnings report, Virgin Galactic also revealed that it had made $2.6 million in revenue this quarter but netted a total loss of $48 million, down from the $94 million net loss the company suffered in the second quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTHENP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGiEFL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood says a hacker who tried to extort the company got access to data for 7 million customers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adiDT19QxumRrD2ILB0igeaR9TE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114077/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Robinhood says more than 7 million customers affected by ‘data security incident’&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXtNfP"&gt;Trading platform Robinhood said Monday that personal information for more than 7 million customers was accessed during a data breach on November 3rd. The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that it does not appear that Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed, and no customers have had “financial loss” due to the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr5Fze"&gt;An unauthorized third party “socially engineered a customer support employee by phone,” Robinhood said, and was able to access its customer support systems. The attacker was able to get a list of email addresses for approximately 5 million people and full names for a separate group of 2 million people. For a smaller group of about 310 people, additional personal information, including names, dates of birth, and zip codes, was exposed, and for about 10 customers, “more extensive account details” were revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRYKKq"&gt;The company did not provide further information about what those “extensive” details were, but a spokesperson said in response to a query from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that even for those 10 customers, “we believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed.” The spokesperson declined to say whether any of the customers may have been specifically targeted in the hack, but the company said it was in the process of notifying those who had been affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOpeQb"&gt;“Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do,” Robinhood chief security officer Caleb Sima said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCMr2a"&gt;After it was able to contain the attack, Robinhood said the unauthorized third party sought an “extortion payment,” and the company notified law enforcement but did not say whether it had made any payments. Robinhood enlisted the help of outside security firm Mandiant as it investigates the incident. Charles Carmakal, CTO of Mandiant, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had “recently observed this threat actor in a limited number of security incidents, and we expect they will continue to target and extort other organizations over the next several months.” He did not elaborate further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdUO1y"&gt;Customers seeking information about whether their accounts were affected should visit the help center on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="obBPd9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MPMc8F"&gt;Robinhood has had a rocky 2021 so far; in January, it halted trading as Redditors helped push up the prices of so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Theaters. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290110/house-financial-services-robinhood-gamestop-squeeze-roaringkitty-hearing"&gt;incidents led to a congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; where CEO Vlad Tenev testified along with Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and trader Keith Gill aka RoaringKitty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dnU1g"&gt;The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600570/robinhood-ipo-retail-investors"&gt;trading on the Nasdaq exchange in July&lt;/a&gt;, with the worst market debut among 51 US firms that raised as much money or more than Robinhood, according to data from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/robinhood-flirts-with-worst-debut-ever-for-ipo-of-its-size"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559438/robinhood-ipo-dogecoin-hood-revenue-2021"&gt;S-1 filing&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood acknowledged a recent SEC Enforcement Division inquiry and that the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California had executed a search warrant for Tenev’s phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lIzM0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed for two weeks, arriving December 7th instead of November 23rd. &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/543305a31fe801d5df3a29ef2cea581e00b46761"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, game director Naoki Yoshida says the delay was to ensure adequate quality assurance testing in the final days of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXfOcI"&gt;Yoshida says the decision to delay the game arose from a desire to ensure &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s story was something that befit 11 years of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s epic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRwcK6"&gt;“We remained firmly resolved to adjust down to the smallest nuances and ensure our writing covers even the finest points of the vast and intricate story that has spanned these past 11 years since the original &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that everyone can fully enjoy their adventure in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;,” Yoshida writes. However, the time it took to make the necessary story adjustments disrupted &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s quality assurance testing schedule. Notably, Yoshida cites the game’s stability as a major factor in postponing the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zzaQWe"&gt;In July, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; saw &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c2d7b35d55577879086b64cfde0acb6c23ccd07f"&gt;a massive increase in popularity&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the digital deluxe version of the game &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-is-so-popular-even-the-digital-versio-1847272446"&gt;selling out&lt;/a&gt; and new character creation on North American servers briefly disabled. The spike in new players caused longer login queues and prompted Square Enix to kick idle players while increasing capacity in order to help with server congestion — all without a major release driving player interest. With &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; on the horizon, Yoshida wanted to ensure the game could handle what will likely be an even bigger spike in players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvNSJO"&gt;Yoshida was apologetic for the delay, &lt;a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/RoundTemperedBobaTF2John-yFh46EuFMIHtXhJt"&gt;apparently tearing up&lt;/a&gt; as he made the announcement. The beloved developer, affectionately known as Yoshi-P, said he took players’ potential inconveniences — like requesting time off to play — into account before making the difficult decision to postpone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjqHOU"&gt;“I was incredibly torn between whether or not we should cut down the expansion pack’s volume or even release content in installments,” Yoshida writes. “As such, I humbly ask you all to forgive me for the decision I’ve made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vncPDr"&gt;The new date places &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;a day before the release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving the first full week of December two of the biggest, most-anticipated titles of the last couple years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xQPtk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; launches on PC and PlayStation December 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
