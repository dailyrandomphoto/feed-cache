    <title>Tesla is apparently installing Starlink antennas at some charging stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4STLYvfoC-GdEVnWA3wz5q34jI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144748/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7DAPF"&gt;Charging your Tesla isn’t the most exciting experience — especially if you’re not paying for the cellular data plan that comes with a Premium Connectivity subscription — but a report from &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/14/tesla-starts-deploying-starlink-satellite-internet-systems-supercharger-stations/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that may be about to change. According to the report, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qte6h1/starlink_dish_dishy_mcflatface_spotted_at/"&gt;a user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; noticed a Starlink dish, which goes by the official name Dishy McFlatface, at a Supercharger station in Lake City, Florida. So far, it remains unclear where else Tesla has deployed (or plans to deploy) Starlink satellite dishes and what purpose they’ll serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjWSLg"&gt;It’s possible the dish will provide complimentary Wi-Fi to customers without Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/connectivity"&gt;Premium Connectivity plan&lt;/a&gt; — those with the $10 per month subscription can take advantage of Tesla’s built-in entertainment apps, such as Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, YouTube, and more with access to cellular data. If the satellite dishes are there to provide Wi-Fi while you charge your car, that means even drivers with Standard Connectivity can access in-car entertainment options while juicing up their EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7l3PMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It might have to do with Musk’s plan to make the Supercharger network available to other types of EVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3WFEX"&gt;It might also have to do with Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;Elon Musk’s plan to make the Supercharger network available&lt;/a&gt; to other types of EVs. According to &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-confirms-opening-supercharger-network-to-other-evs-what-s-the-revenue-potential-1030652724"&gt;an estimate from Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla’s annual revenue earned from charging could jump from $1 billion to $25 billion if it opens up charging stations to other EVs. The cost of charging at a Supercharger station varies throughout the day, and drivers are either charged by kilowatts per hour or by the minute. Having free internet access through Starlink might attract drivers outside of the Tesla ecosystem, maybe even helping Tesla outperform Goldman Sachs’ estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REQ2ND"&gt;Tesla already started letting non-Tesla EVs access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757159/tesla-supercharge-ev-pilot-netherlands"&gt;Supercharger stations at 10 locations in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, and it likely began the pilot there because standardized charging cable connectors are mandatory in Europe. In the US, non-Tesla EVs will need adapters to use Supercharger stations, which only complicates things. If and when Superchargers are made available to everyone, tacking on free Wi-Fi on top of speedy charging times might make other EV drivers choose Superchargers over its competitors, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409310/chargepoint-android-auto-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629187/evgo-charging-pricing-subscription-free-charging"&gt;EVgo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VErnvn"&gt;At this time of writing, the Musk-owned SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launch-starlink-satellites-internet-constellation/"&gt;launched a total of 1,844 Starlink satellites&lt;/a&gt; into space since 2018, with the goal of providing internet access to even the remotest areas of the world. Starlink also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;more lightweight, rectangular version of Dishy McFlatface&lt;/a&gt;, although this doesn’t look like the model installed on the Florida Supercharger station.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung hasn’t completely forgotten its Tizen smartwatches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up of Samsung Galaxy Watch 3’s app menu" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5PrfXgp5K1-lvMmdb3TIGpiVvg=/0x0:5417x3611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144618/dseifert_200811_4139_0018.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAupkg"&gt;When Samsung dropped the bombshell that it was ditching Tizen for Wear OS 3, it promised &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/editorial-a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here"&gt;not to leave older Galaxy Watch models in the dust&lt;/a&gt;. Now Samsung has announced that the Galaxy Watch, Galaxy Watch 3, Galaxy Watch Active, and Galaxy Watch Active 2 will get new watchfaces and health features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782772/samsung-one-ui-4-android-12-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-release-date-features"&gt;as part of One UI 4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cS5zr"&gt;Fall detection isn’t new on Samsung’s smartwatches, but today’s update will give you the option to tweak the feature’s sensitivity. According to Samsung’s press release, it says you can “choose to detect a fall when you are standing still.” Previously, Samsung’s fall detection feature was designed to detect hard falls when you’re running or moving. Triggering the feature will automatically send an SOS message to pre-selected contacts. That said, the feature is limited to Samsung’s newer Tizen watches and isn’t coming to the original Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Watch Active. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Examples of the fall detection feature on a Samsung watch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jurTD9Tk7-t8omVJA9o8dhvs00A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015858/01_galaxy_watch_software_update_fall_detection.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tizen users can tweak how sensitive Samsung’s fall detection feature is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fZsPuI"&gt;Another small health feature update is Group Challenges, which lets you keep track of the competition from your wrist. All four smartwatches will also get 10 new watch faces that launched this past summer with the Galaxy Watch 4. As for when all these updates will arrive, Samsung says they’re coming to Bluetooth devices first, with the LTE rollout coming sometime later. The company also says you’ll need to update to the latest Galaxy Wearable app and Galaxy Watch plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A showcase of the 10 new watch faces" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vl_JjnRgrA1YN3FiWsNBqK-PSEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015867/04_galaxy_watch_software_update_new_watch_face.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new watch faces for the Galaxy Watch 4 are coming to older models.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bShaTr"&gt;Altogether these aren’t earth-shattering updates, but it’s encouraging to see Samsung hasn’t abandoned its Tizen smartwatches — particularly since the Galaxy Watch Active 2 and Galaxy Watch 3 were still fresh when Samsung announced it was giving up on Tizen. Google has also been steadily adding and improving features in Wear OS 2, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;Gboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583906/google-play-store-wear-os-android-new-design"&gt;a revamped Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s especially important to see Samsung and Google support the older hardware, given the switch to the new unified Wear OS 3 will be a bumpy one. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 lineup represents the only smartwatches that have the platform right now, and a mere handful of existing Wear OS watches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;will be eligible to upgrade in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 75t wireless earbuds are back down to their lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUCgFpwjRlHaBFxhkCmZb5c8IcQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144340/awhite_191218_3847_20191218_0049.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGKRmp"&gt;If you’re after a great bargain on truly wireless earbuds that we really like, check out Best Buy’s deal on the Jabra Elite 75t. These usually cost $150, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rD3hAvWz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the black-colored model is back down to just $80&lt;/a&gt; — matching the lowest price yet. Best Buy says that this is its best deal of the season, and it’ll price match retailers if you find a better price. Consider this a great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday deal&lt;/a&gt; that you can take advantage of to get ahead with your holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6PsXu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Chris Welch enjoyed the several improvements that the Elite 75t made to the already-winning Elite 65t formula. They’re smaller, with a more comfortable design. And the sound quality should please those who are looking for thumping bass. The Elite 75t can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, which is often something you can’t count on finding in a new set of wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fsgcLC"&gt;The Razer Barracuda X wireless gaming headset in the black colorway is $20 off its already-reasonable $100 price at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rNiJSUMf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first price drop that I’ve seen, and this model is easy to recommend for PC and console players. It’s a lightweight model that supports a wireless 2.4GHz connection to its USB-C audio transmitter, which can plug directly into the PS5, a Nintendo Switch, or a recent MacBook, to name a few devices. It comes with a USB-A adapter and extender for other gadgets that don’t have one of those plugs. It has USB-C charging, and its array of buttons are simple to learn. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more coverage here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Xbox copy will work for Xbox One consoles, as well as the newer Xbox Series X. The PS4 version includes a free upgrade to the PS5 version. Though, the PS5 version is the same cost, so get that one if you have Sony’s latest console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lg1uHh"&gt;Razer’s Kishi controller grip is seeing steep discounts at Amazon. The Android version is always the least pricey version, and it has the lowest price today. Originally $90, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can snag it for $55&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll fit most phones except for the most massive ones on the market. This controller is great if you want to play mobile games with a controller or have a more elegant way to play cloud games via xCloud or Stadia from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8fpzv"&gt;The version of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Controller-Gamepad-iPhone/dp/B09886XVFR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kishi made for iPhones costs $80&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $100 price. It’s the same as the Android version, except for its Lightning port passthrough (as opposed to USB-C) and menu buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After all those podcast ads, Casper sells to a private equity firm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Casper Celebrates In LA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EePzXKuo-tmVeolcvQIy8zVjA0U=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144334/480182226.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Casper Sleep Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdk3mH"&gt;Casper Sleep is being acquired by private equity firm Durational Capital Management, which will take the boxed mattress company private, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211115005534/en/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF0PGy"&gt;Founded in 2014, Casper was one of a handful of companies whose ads were ubiquitous on podcasts and that sold its products directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm3I1U"&gt;The company went public in February 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060460/casper-tech-ipo-mattresses"&gt;plans to expand from its primary business&lt;/a&gt; of direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales of boxed mattresses into products that “promote the ideal ambience for sleep,” according to its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598674/000104746920000166/a2240404zs-1.htm"&gt;S-1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. That list of products included sleep tracking devices, bedside clocks, sleep services like digital apps and counseling, and even sleep supplements. But besides mattresses and things that go on mattresses — like sheets and pillows — the most notable product Casper has produced to date is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/29/18201229/casper-mattress-glow-bedside-light-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Glow bedside lamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygZkao"&gt;Casper began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/casper-a-web-pioneer-to-open-200-stores-1533729600"&gt;adding retail locations in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and sold its products at retailers like Target and Mattress Warehouse, but struggled to turn a profit in the increasingly crowded direct-to-consumer (D2C) mattress market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzC0w2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casper-reports-third-quarter-results-131600769.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAII7sQV44U5e2qgIQZ9qsnsLZgYTFATCjQ97phKdwtZuExt9WpdKR9HRdhOA49EhWnL0vUKxPnhIrhjWgfA6PqoTMX9qRhWBezYi6RtFyvqNR4kCMbDXfDnCHe04GfVHWRQxv9lPQrrvwaSK6_vESCZlHHhth-59ZVhK2V_EAsbS"&gt;Casper reported that it lost $25.3 million&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, compared to a loss of $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The company also announced that its president and chief commercial officer Emilie Arel has been appointed CEO, taking over from Casper co-founder Philip Krim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whARUy"&gt;Casper’s board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition, which awaits approval by Casper stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSLsz4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Halo-themed Xbox Series X is available today at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v3KlAh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;limited-edition &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; is coming to select Best Buy stores across the US today. The console includes a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, which will be playable on December 8th — or possibly sooner, if you believe internet rumors about a countdown ending today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4eu8"&gt;You can check for participating stores near you on Best Buy’s &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox in-store event page&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like the page was just posted around 6AM ET today, in line with a tweet from restocking tipster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks"&gt;Lord Restock&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks/status/1459284690771320835"&gt;same account&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other console trackers, indicates the consoles will be available today from &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2FBestBuy.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BestBuy.com&lt;/a&gt;. They expect to see the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Xbox Series X restocked along with a number of PS5s and Nintendo Switch OLEDs, however, those sales may only be available to people who are a part of Best Buy’s $200 Totaltech support membership program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0zBrsi"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHoDDP"&gt;In addition to the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Series X, stores will also be selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;Special Edition 20th Anniversary Xbox controller and headset&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy notes that its employees will start handing out tickets for each product at 7:30AM local time and that you can only take a maximum of one ticket per item. If you get a ticket, Best Buy says that “you will be guaranteed the opportunity to purchase that item.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under-display cameras are slowly getting better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzxHaot5gReB6iNuMOFEtYRBUI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144165/UDC_v02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoB38H"&gt;As is often the case with new technology, under-display cameras didn’t make a great first impression. It’s a nice idea in theory, of course — you don’t need a notch or a hole-punch if you can put a selfie camera under the display — but the earliest efforts had some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGn1Zb"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 last year was the first phone to ship with one, and it was bad. The camera quality was incredibly poor, and the area of the screen looked more distracting than a notch. Samsung followed up this year with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which had similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zlghiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n8DWBZ"&gt;But things are actually getting better. Two newer phones on the market, Xiaomi’s Mix 4 and ZTE’s Axon 30, use a different approach to the technology, and it’s an improvement on the previous generation. Instead of having a lower resolution area of the screen that allows light through to the camera, they shrink the size of the pixels without reducing the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUPvyE"&gt;This means that the part of the screen that covers the camera is really difficult to see in normal use. Look at how the Axon 30 compares to the Axon 20 on a white background, which was the most challenging situation for the older phone to disguise the camera in. It’s also much harder to make out than the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PtU8R9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10865855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDMSTZ"&gt;Image quality from the camera is improved, too. Look at these selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0SGA5EZ5oacEfndGn3D1Kscres=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015429/ztecomp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A selfie from ZTE’s Axon 20 on the left, and from the Axon 30 on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YH093A"&gt;Now, the camera is clearly still compromised compared to one that doesn’t have to gather light from behind a screen. ZTE and Xiaomi lean hard on algorithms for post-processing — you can tell because the live image preview looks much worse than the final picture. The results still look over-processed and unnatural, even if they’re more usable than their predecessors’. Video quality is also bad, because it’s probably too much to ask for these phones to do the processing in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ10Pg"&gt;Still, the pictures you get are definitely usable most of the time. If you’re not a big selfie person, or if you don’t use your phone for Zoom calls, I think you could get away with it. If those use cases are important to you, though, you should probably stick with a hole punch or a notch. Especially if you just don’t care about hole punches or notches, as I believe is the case for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBjkrc"&gt;There’s more to the idea than just reducing the size of your phone bezels, though. We spoke to Steven Bathiche from Microsoft’s Applied Sciences group on how the company is working on under-display cameras for an entirely different reason — so you can maintain eye contact while looking at your screen on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEdVii"&gt;For that conversation, as well as more on how ZTE and Xiaomi’s phones work in practice, check out the video up top.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 home tech holiday gift guide</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Spruce up your digs with some clever gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nmh7YT"&gt;Home is what you make it, so why not make it as awesome as possible? Sometimes, that can be done by just hanging up a sentimental photo in a frame or spritzing things up occasionally with some flowers or a new piece of furniture. Every now and again, however, you just need to gift yourself some crafty home tech goodies or buy them for someone you care about. Not every item in the list below has a circuit board built into it — though many of them do; instead, what ties them all together is that, in small ways, they’ll make your home look better and operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPlj3d"&gt;We’ve consulted the minds at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for their ideas, and what follows are a couple dozen gift ideas for anyone who’s looking to liven up their abode with some clever home tech. From an affordable robot vacuum and smart lighting to a 4K TV that moonlights as a Monet when not in use, there’s something for everyone on our list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bTudgm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"},{"title":"The Verge’s Favorite Holiday Gifts Under $50","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for creators","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746670/holiday-gift-ideas-2021-creators-content-artists-tech-gadgets-creative"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 gaming and entertainment holiday gift guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22511328"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22523911"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="G4Yne5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10855455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zeosgij68RQdPjnroiORldVLV2M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144233/Mom.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas that go beyond the flower bouquet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5etm1R"&gt;If you were to ask your mom what she wants for the holidays, she’ll likely tell you “nothing” — followed by something equally unhelpful like “your happiness.” That’s because moms can be loving, selfless superheroes who often prioritize the needs of their loved ones over their own. While admirable, that also means you’re not going to get much help from them when it comes to buying the perfect gift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0tVR"&gt;Thankfully, we’ve gathered plenty of great presents you can surprise your mom with. We've included a monthly candle subscription for those in need of some relaxation ($10), as well as an annual pass that allows for unfettered access to our national parks ($80). And for the fitness enthusiast, we recommend the Apple Watch SE ($270), a smartwatch that is — lucky for you — more affordable than other Apple wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrhYJI"&gt;Below, you’ll find other gifts that cater to all kinds of budgets and passions, ranging from books and instant cameras to Apple’s latest desktop. Peruse the list and see if there’s anything on here that might resonate with your mom this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midnight Protocol is a cyberpunk hacking RPG that cuts out all the filler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hacking grid in Midnight Protocol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXeX7D8dKgJ3CeztU6Qsxo3lwRk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144102/ss_73966f432c7a96ff9362717c4493e60a8fc0ca8b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iceberg Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkmQXx"&gt;Video games have taught me that hacking mainly involves two things: capturing little computer-shaped nodes and typing in a command line. &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. Released last month by Iceberg Interactive, it joins a glut of cyberpunk games from the past couple of years, and it doesn’t add any single standout innovation to a pretty familiar formula. But it’s one of the best iterations of that formula I’ve seen: mechanically elegant, narratively economical, and crafted with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwrggp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is noir cyber-crime by way of turn-based roleplaying games and spatial puzzles. When you log into its slightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification"&gt;airspace-looking&lt;/a&gt; simulated computer desktop, you’ll learn that your pseudonym is Data, and you’re a master hacker who just narrowly avoided imprisonment. At first you’re simply trying to get back on your feet, taking small jobs from your veteran fixer Snail with some help from a young, morally conflicted partner named Clover. But you’re also hunting down the person who leaked information about you online, and as you uncover their identity, you realize there’s something troubling afoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QBxqjt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEDUfoQIHBk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PkFjlC"&gt;Developer LuGus Studios draws on the cyberpunk genre’s hardboiled roots rather than reaching for elaborate worldbuilding, heavy-handed commentary, or retro-futuristic nostalgia. Your protagonist is fundamentally a futuristic version of the private investigator who’s stumbled on a dangerous secret that could get them killed. The longer you play, the more the game delves into its sci-fi premise and even the conceit of its fake desktop interface. But the writing stays admirably restrained, surgically paring down stock genre plots and using passing references and terse messages to build its characters’ histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txghjh"&gt;Much of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt;’s story plays out over simulated emails, chat sessions, and a small searchable data bank. The meat of the game, however, lies behind a list of network addresses sent by other characters. Addresses lead to levels composed of interconnected nodes with different functions. Your goal is to complete a task — like acquiring a file or installing a virus — using a keyboard-only interface for jumping across nodes, deploying hacking tools, and allocating power between different programs. In its default mode, each turn gives you two actions before the network responds to your moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJgr7G"&gt;Between network heists, players have access to a black market of hacking programs and hardware upgrades, which can be purchased with credits siphoned from computer networks. The key to progression is completing jobs that unlock new programs through a reputation system, looking at reports about what’s on a given network, and picking a loadout of software that will let you tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEapr0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Networks are fine-tuned for different styles of challenge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I1okOC"&gt;I dropped a link to &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack gaming channel soon after I started playing, and it drew immediate comparisons to the hacking sections from &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/em&gt;. That’s fair, and there are plenty of other potential comparisons as well. The node system is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Uplink&lt;/em&gt;, while the faux command line conceit was used in &lt;em&gt;Hacknet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/9/3622854/quadrilateral-cowboy-cyberpunk-hacking-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quadrilateral Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/25/4555842/shadowrun-returns-hands-on-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowrun Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;features turn-based RPG virtual combat. Moving between the nodes even feels a bit like the puzzles of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/17/5623940/hitman-go-ios-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;as you’re trying to reach the right targets in the right order while a network trace bar gradually fills up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lr0UVn"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; synthesizes these elements into something that’s minimalist yet incredibly polished — imagine the story of your favorite sci-fi RPG was set inside its hacking mini-game. It’s an experience with absolutely zero filler. Every network is fine-tuned to offer a specific flavor of challenge or an intriguing bit of world detail, including small choices that the game keeps track of, sometimes by increasing your “white hat” (idealistic) or “black hat” (selfishly criminal) reputation, and sometimes through emails from your clients or conversations with Snail and Clover.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KM948B"&gt;This can be frustrating at the beginning when you’ve got a bare-bones deck and desperately need money, because there’s no easy way to grind for the credits you’ll need to buy hacking programs. It’s also not immediately obvious that you can restart missions and make tweaks to your loadout before you jump back into the network, something that made the game instantly more rewarding for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8VgAl"&gt;Once you’ve got a well-stocked software library and a good grip on the formula, though, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect mix of short puzzles that require darting through with laser-focused precision, big messy node grids to methodically dismantle, boss battles full of on-the-fly strategizing, and the occasional cathartic smash-and-grab level you can utterly dominate — plus a couple of secrets that require poking around Data’s desktop. While I found myself leaning a lot on a few core programs, the design encouraged me to mix up my strategy to suit the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IhepA"&gt;I haven’t explored every corner of the story or gameplay, particularly an alternate mode that lets you play in real time against network protocols. But a reasonably full playthrough can completely consume a long weekend (or a more restrained series of weeknights) without losing momentum or becoming repetitive. There are lots of games sort of like &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt;, but few deliver so many strong variations on a simple theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCPu3h"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Midnight Protocol &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;was released on October 13th and is available on Steam and GOG for Windows, macOS, and Linux.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
