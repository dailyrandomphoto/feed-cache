    <title>Google is buying a company for half a billion dollars to boost cloud security</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LRd2A"&gt;Google’s $500 million acquisition of Israel-based startup &lt;a href="https://www.siemplify.co/"&gt;Siemplify&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to help the company bolster its own cloud security initiative, Chronicle, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/google-beefs-up-internet-security-with-siemplify-buyout-2022-01-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations"&gt;blog post announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt;, Google describes Siemplify as a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) organization and plans to integrate its capabilities into Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FfTHM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5vD8p"&gt;“Siemplify is an intuitive workbench that enables security teams to both manage risk better and reduce the cost of addressing threats,” Sunil Potti, the vice president of Google Cloud Security, states in the blog post. “Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end, respond to cyber threats with speed and precision, and get smarter with every analyst interaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulYCvX"&gt;Siemplify got its start in 2015, and as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes, it has raised a total of $58 million from investors to date. A source close to the situation told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the Alphabet-owned Google became interested in purchasing the startup after it heard Siemplify was gearing up for another round of funding. Siemplify will now join Chronicle under the Google Cloud umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoCE0R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16929320/google-x-cybersecurity-chronicle-spin-off-alphabet"&gt;Chronicle was first launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after spinning off of X Development (formerly Google X), Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” and is supposed to help large enterprises detect, analyze, and store security-related information. According to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kej3e/chronicle-is-dead-and-google-killed-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, security experts were excited about the up-and-coming company when it first launched, as it was supposed to use innovative machine-learning technology and telemetry data to boost companies’ cybersecurity. But after &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/the-security-moonshot-joins-google-cloud"&gt;becoming an arm of Google Cloud in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reports that some employees quit — including co-founder Mike Wiacek — as a result of feeling that the company lost its original purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIdPwf"&gt;Google’s acquisition of Siemplify doesn’t come long after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642054/apple-amazon-google-microsoft-cybersecurity-billions"&gt;tech giant promised to spend over $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to help improve US cybersecurity. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;President Joe Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to help strengthen national cybersecurity in light of the major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;attacks on the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s CES 2022 showcase includes a metaverse experience we didn’t ask for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wEn0h3dHO4-N3iSpbddkcyTiQg4=/598x0:2286x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350643/IMG_1212.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get ice cream, talk to other booth goers, and barely interact with anything in Samsung’s “My House” CES experience.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NTFcY0"&gt;On the first day of CES 2022, Samsung opened up the virtual doors to its My House metaverse experience. The company built a customizable digital home accessible through the Zepeto app — a metaverse platform. With the number of COVID-19 infections reaching new highs, many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;pulled out&lt;/a&gt; or downsized their physical presence for CES this year — making virtual options like livestreaming a booth from a phone or, in this case, a metaverse booth, alternative ways to share products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/faJCZtfW5Di0l2j_8-JeBQEgudU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146832/Metaverse_My_House_main2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Don’t get too excited...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="heea9N"&gt;The problem is, no one asked Samsung for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; metaverse experience. Especially not the target audience the company’s press release stated this is for — millennials and zoomers. Just take a look at the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/ces-2022-samsung-x-zepeto-interacting-with-innovative-home-appliances-in-the-metaverse"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; trying to sell the idea; I’m imagining this pitch from an employee word for word in a Zoom call to Samsung executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFkumU"&gt;You’ve likely heard of the metaverse before. It’s no longer a fad, but a well-established trend of the future. With online communication continuously evolving, the metaverse has created new industrial, social and cultural values. Millennials and ‘zoomers’ (members of Gen Z) are using this digital space to project identities that are different from reality, and have created a new world of experiences through active interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4JbqFvlx1M7u4NOvfravnd0QEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146839/IMG_1210.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This customized living room has two of Samsung’s Bespoke Jet vacuum cleaners — any less and this place would be a mess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p8edIX"&gt;Samsung began this metaverse partnership with Zepeto developer Naver Z back in August of last year with the platformer game-like Galaxy House experience that features members of BTS. But the CES version opts for more of a &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; experience: players can walk around a fenced yard and enter a customizable home packed with Samsung products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;Freestyle projector&lt;/a&gt;, Bespoke vacuum cleaner, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i3oUVN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10962543"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qn96oz"&gt;You start off in the front yard of the house, where you can interact with other people and also visit different homes. Different walls, decor, and finishes are available, but the actual layout of the home remains the same for everyone. You enter the front door into the living room, turn right into the kitchen that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;colorful Bespoke appliances&lt;/a&gt;, then take another right to what seems to be an open-concept laundry room, and finally move down the hall with the office, bedroom, and bathroom. There’s also a whole front and backyard, but you can’t do anything other than sit down in a few places and sit on top of a treehouse (which you annoyingly can’t even enter).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R6x5rj7OgbiI-Ilnpi0tljKV7pw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146928/IMG_1211.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feeling the breeze from what looks like a Samsung tower fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gba32U"&gt;I fully expected this experience to have a lot of product information — like an actual CES booth — but the makers of this Samsung’s experience apparently wanted the products to remain low-key and focus on how Instagram-ready your imaginary home can look. You can pick up the Bespoke Jet vacuum and run around with it, stand in front of an air purifier and enjoy the breeze, and play video games on the unknown model TV in the living room or on a curved Samsung monitor in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bowOrEkvRpykJQaoP1GJd1xucuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146913/IMG_1204.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The animations are silly loops: your avatar will just randomly type on the keyboard while a looping video of a racing game displays on the unknown Samsung curved monitor. It’s certainly not like the new enormous &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ark monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlB_2s1D4IuRMVA0glppp1gmtxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146917/IMG_1194.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I like to listen to music while vacuuming the Kitchen but I didn’t find any Bixby powered &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21136224/samsung-galaxy-home-bixby-not-released" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galaxy Home speaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose between Samsung’s Sero rotating TV or The Frame TV in the bedroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s expensive AirDresser clothes sanitizer hands you a sparkling shirt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No not really, Jeromy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tuh6Pr"&gt;I do wish Samsung made its CES experience on Zepeto more like the previous &lt;a href="https://zefro.zepeto.me/nds/event/wP7mO3wK87DsFLca2TtXfbN?lang=en"&gt;Galaxy House experience&lt;/a&gt; from August. That felt more like a product showcase and more CES-like than this My House experience. I visited the old experience as well — where I am challenged to do some &lt;em&gt;Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;-style platform jumping to the top of a Space-themed world so I can take a selfie with Jin from BTS. It was much more engaging than walking into a bathroom in the My House experience — where you can brush your teeth but not do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F5f71p0wET9C4xv-YON4GJRsMzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146943/IMG_1177.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy House Zepeto experience from August was much more fun. I got a selfie with Jin and climbed Super Mario-like moving platforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXs6pwm7IAOUa8rQAIpuYBNFtSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146947/IMG_1160.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy House bottom floor which has products you can buy in a metaverse — that’s what Samsung should have done for its CES experience as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The PS5 Digital Edition is available right now at Best Buy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_XhTQQpVqV7dFaeGQeKySBaVWDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350465/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 11:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Both versions of Sony’s console are on sale at Best Buy, although availability will vary by location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCWjoE"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 11:40AM ET, also started selling the even-harder-to-get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl92e6Q6zH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. Best Buy’s recently-updated queue system may not work well if you try to open multiple tabs, but keep your phone handy — if you have trouble verifying your account you may be able to do it in the mobile app and check out once the PlayStation 5 is in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSq4pr"&gt;After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available for pickup at stores in your area. If you strike out, stay vigilant, the store tends to restock in waves so there may be more consoles in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kRs6ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall may not pay off at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="xvWX9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="82lPGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAvH7w"&gt;We’re wishing you all of the luck in getting a PS5 today. As usual, signing into your account ahead of the restock, and making sure that all of the pertinent shipping and payment info, can only help your chances of success. But generally, once you’re in the queue for a console, just hang tight and maybe cross those fingers that you actually get a console today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWcsCA"&gt;Some must-have PS5 accessories and games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PlayStation 5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryKE4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Turning Point is quietly building the next generation of conservative influencers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjtxBg2W7zGz7jqlnE-1sXlQSgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350631/acastro_220104_4954_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Influencer first, conservative second&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KehuqL"&gt;Late in December, some of the conservative movement’s biggest influencers gathered at the Monarch Theatre in Downtown Phoenix for what was advertised as “the biggest patriot’s party ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnfiEP"&gt;Inside, the DJ played a club remix of the “Let’s go, Brandon!” chant, while a curly-haired kid wearing a proper button-up and slacks swang from an aerial hoop above the stage. James O’Keefe, right-wing political activist and founder of Project Veritas, posed for selfies with eager, young fans as the music boomed. Organizers said Matt Gaetz, the Florida lawmaker currently embroiled in scandal &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html"&gt;amid allegations of child sex trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, made an appearance earlier in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7QAto"&gt;The partygoers were in town for AmericaFest, Turning Point USA’s final student activism conference of the year. But while the official speaker list focused on Fox News regulars like Gaetz, the party was geared towards younger influencers, drawn together by Turning Point’s ambassador program. Some of them were lifestyle influencers, while others ran communications for Republican congressmen in Washington like Madison Cawthorn.   Many already had podcasts and brand deals. At the event, they wore special badges giving them access to a VIP lounge in the convention center only a few blocks from the hotel rooms Turning Point had booked for them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuwFtW"&gt;For nearly a decade, Turning Point USA has served as a new kind of College Republican club, setting up a network of campus organizations through its chapter program. But in recent years, the organization has moved beyond on-campus organizing to something more ambitious, launching podcasts and online shows with an eye towards fostering young Republican influencers online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta6ehW"&gt;Increasingly, those influencers are Turning Point’s focus — finding ways to promote them, popularize them, and integrate them into the broader world of conservative media and politics. Instead of the campus, Turning Point is now focused on the politics of Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube and using them to reach a new generation of voters. With platforms increasingly willing to ban conservative voices who violate platform rules, it’s a difficult task and an urgent one for conservatives who fear they’re losing their sway with younger voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouePHe"&gt;The project comes with real money. Turning Point’s 2021 investor prospectus set the budget for its media branch (which handles influencer outreach) &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21091980-turning-point-usa-2021-investor-prospectus"&gt;at over $7.2 million&lt;/a&gt;. The organization has onboarded and trained over 400 creators as brand ambassadors, a number verified on social media and in a &lt;a href="https://quizlet.com/547020737/tpusa-influencers-flash-cards/"&gt;Turning Point Quizlet account&lt;/a&gt; that was taken down shortly after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the organization for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gf1Z8"&gt;While Turning Point hires talent to host their in-house productions, these unpaid “ambassadors” make up a much larger portion of the organization’s brand media output. As TPUSA’s most recent press kit described it, ambassadors “use their platforms to help share our message with their audiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiToyb"&gt;At the same time, Turning Point seems to have struggled spreading its message on social media through conventional channels. An internal presentation obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;found that, as of October, only 15 percent of Turning Point’s Instagram audience are student-aged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7QFrQ6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only 15 percent of Turning Point’s Instagram audience are student-aged&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkJY4m"&gt;“The content that is going out right now is completely missing our target audience,” the report concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAhzKV"&gt;Reached for comment, Turning Point denied many of the figures in the presentation. “The presentations in question contain multiple inaccuracies and erroneous data,” a representative said. “They are not official TPUSA documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSeohY"&gt;Still, additional details provided by the group confirmed the accuracy of the Instagram age statistics. “Some of the user demographics are inherent to the user base that exists on Instagram,” Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point spokesman, said on Wednesday. The presentations were removed shortly after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Turning Point for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK27cZ"&gt;In order to appeal to their target audience, the presentation called for a total revamp of Turning Point’s social media accounts. Specifically, it outlined an “influencer first” and “conservative second” posting model and for the organization to present itself more like Barstool Sports online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gcvy33"&gt;At the national conference in December, Turning Point appeared to take her advice. For two days before the conference officially began, dozens of ambassadors were invited to an “influencer retreat” where Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk and prominent Republican creators like Benny Johnson taught them how to become effective posters in the right’s online culture war with the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFN7rE"&gt;In one presentation slide explaining how to stay out of the news, Turning Point told the ambassadors what not to post online. “NO RACISM!” “NO BIGOTRY!” “PROVOCATIVE BUT MAINSTREAM!” the slide read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j2tvu"&gt;In a conference room, Kirk pleaded with the attendees to stop getting into public fights with each other on the timeline. “Let me just say one thing that bothers us at Turning Point, and I try to never participate in it. When I see some of you guys fighting back and forth, like just cut it out. You guys think you’re being all tough,” he said in an Instagram story &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXl1RLgpZrH/"&gt;published by the user @tokenblackguyusa&lt;/a&gt;. “No one really cares. Nobody wants to see it. If it’s a private messaging service, you guys can do that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBtCAE"&gt;Turning Point did not immediately provide additional slides or posting guidelines when asked for comment on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters In Phoenix Hold “America First” Event" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewP9uKZS5_G9z0BA2eUKpt3zVT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147220/1359768309.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c51cLH"&gt;Much of the conference itself was built for content creation. Dozens of ring lights were set up in front of Turning Point-branded backdrops around the exhibitor’s hall. Walking to the speaker stage, I watched as hoards of students and influencers bobbed their heads to trending TikTok audios and hosted livestreams in front of them all throughout the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUppLx"&gt;Ambassadors don’t draw a salary, but the organization rewards them in other ways. Some, like Laura Lee Spears, advertise their Turning Point merch store codes on Instagram where they could make commissions off sales. Turning Point did not immediately confirm whether ambassadors receive commissions off of their merch sales. Once an influencer is approved as an ambassador, they’re allowed to apply for travel stipends to attend Turning Point’s conferences in states all across the country. These trips are not only content creation opportunities but networking ones for more politically-hungry young people as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FARnq"&gt;The push for conservative influencers has also led to spinoff groups like Today Is America, an influencer management organization that manned a booth at AmericaFest. Managed by former Turning Point ambassador Joe Basrawi, Today Is America currently manages over 200 creators, including the now-banned Republican Hype House TikTok account and a handful of other shows and podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNq37Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Much of the conference itself was built for content creation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Svasv9"&gt;“Turning Point’s focus is students. Ours is specifically creators,” Basrawi told me of Today Is America on Monday. “We made our whole thing to essentially lift up young, conservative creators, give them a brand, and give them the tools that they need to do what they want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17XgbH"&gt;Turning Point and Today Is America have no formal partnership, Basrawi said, but they operate in the same ecosystem and often end up boosting each other’s content. “We’re in group chats with other organizations, like Turning Point USA,” the founder said &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/tmrw/first-time-voters-are-getting-their-election-info-tiktok-it-t194100"&gt;in a 2020 interview&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22XTVh"&gt;Building a strong network to help game social media algorithms is a long-standing technique for influencers. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpy5g/influencers-have-secret-engagement-farms-i-joined-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reported on “influencer pods,”&lt;/a&gt; groups of influencers who boost each other’s content. Turning Point and Today Is America have essentially built one of these pods for conservatives, many of whom believe platforms like Facebook and TikTok suppress their content due to its conservative nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhiplw"&gt;“I have some really close friends that are also bigger on social media, and we had this agreement that we would share each other’s content on [Instagram] stories,” Basrawi told me. “So, that’s one way of fighting the shadowban.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MztzGo"&gt;Sometimes, those techniques go too far. In September 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;uncovered a secret social media campaign&lt;/a&gt; from Turning Point to pay teenagers to post content casting doubt on the integrity of the presidential election in battleground states like Arizona, where the organization is based. After the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;reached out to Facebook and Twitter for comment on these accounts, the platforms removed them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507822/facebook-turning-point-usa-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-troll-farm-ban-election-trump"&gt;Facebook said that the removed accounts&lt;/a&gt; were using false names and that their “sole activity on our platform was associated with this deceptive campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUGGbK"&gt;The structure of the ambassador program also lets Turning Point sidestep most existing disclosure requirements. Existing influencer rules from the Federal Trade Commission only deal with paid posts, as when an influencer gets a free product or money in exchange for posting about it. But even though Turning Point’s influencers get lots of in-kind help — including, in many cases, paid travel to AmericaFest — that support isn’t linked to a specific post, so it doesn’t fall under FTC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ7D8V"&gt;“It gets a lot trickier to disclose relationships with Turning Point and other organizations that have a broader mandate around spreading conservative values that aren’t specific to one election or referendum,” said Brandi Geurkink, who wrote &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/tiktok-political-ads/"&gt;a report on conservative influencers for the Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt; last year. “The fact that this might be algorithmically-promoted to a person through their For You page, what kind of information would we want disclosed to people on the receiving end of this content?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yt0L0w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What kind of information would we want disclosed to people on the receiving end of this content?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrqyRH"&gt;Some ambassadors do disclose their status with the organization in the bios of their Instagram accounts. However, Turning Point did not comment on whether these disclosures are a requirement for associated influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTgpKX"&gt;The federal government has been slow to institute new regulations around political advertising online, whether it be through digital ads on platforms like Facebook or the use of influencer marketing like in the case of Turning Point. Throughout the last presidential election cycle, Joe Biden’s campaign became the first to invest heavily into &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21429755/influencers-joe-biden-democrats-pacs-social-media-facebook-instagram-campaign"&gt;influencer marketing initiatives to persuade voters&lt;/a&gt;. These relationships proved as fruitful for Biden just as they have been for Turning Point, and experts expect to see the industry become more prevalent in politics over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7R2ec"&gt;It’s difficult to measure the effect Turning Point’s influencer program is having on younger voters — but experts say it’s likely to be something that builds up over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFLYi8"&gt;“If we’re trying to judge efficacy, it’s hard because impressions on the internet are a dime a dozen,” Stefan Smith, former online engagement editor for the Pete Buttigieg campaign, said in an interview on Tuesday. “But enough six seconds can build up over several months, and you’re seeing the same conservative YouTube ad pop up in your recommended videos. Suddenly, the view becomes way more mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqs3Ml"&gt;With Fox News&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;broadcasting partnerships and relationships with high-profile Republican lawmakers, Turning Point’s messaging efforts have at least broken through to mainstream conservative media. Now, the organization faces an even bigger task — bringing that message to the unindoctrinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEpBPu"&gt;“You need to not care what they call you when you say something that is true,” Kirk bellowed in his opening night AmericaFest remarks, warning of the libs and their cancel culture tactics. “We live under the tyranny of their social conformity. We live under the tyranny that they hold the cards. Like well, ‘I might not be invited to the cool kids club.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0HzfGf"&gt;“Look around,” Kirk said, gesturing to the thousands of high school and college students in the audience. “You’re at the coolest kids club in America right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus will release a 17-inch foldable OLED laptop this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Four Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED models arranged in a grid, in tablet, clamshell, book, and Surface mode respectively." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8KCLnYFANPc6HxS1Oqzivjzhwc=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350620/Zenbook_17_Fold_OLED_UX9702_Versatile_modes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endless possibilities. (Okay, four, but still.)&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe1dB4"&gt;Each year, it seems that more companies are trying out devices with foldable screens. In the PC space, results for those have been... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt;. But Asus is known for doing funky things, especially funky things with screens. So it was only a matter of time before the company tried its hand at one of these, and we’re finally getting a look at the first generation. Say hello to the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, a 17.3-inch laptop with a foldable OLED screen. For those seeking a more traditional offering, there’s also a clamshell Zenbook 14 OLED coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuNIev"&gt;The primary benefit of a foldable device (apart from the fact that it looks really freakin’ cool) is that it makes a larger screen easier to fit into purses and bags. A 17-inch tablet, in particular, might be a pain for many people to carry around, no matter how thin and light it is. There are also a few more options for how you can use a foldable like this — you can unfold it and use it like a regular tablet, you can prop it up with a kickstand, or you can fold it sideways at a 90-degree angle and use it like a miniature clamshell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDlSWZ"&gt;This was what I enjoyed about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, Lenovo’s shot at this kind of thing. I liked being able to pop the device into different modes depending on what I was doing and the position I was in. That device, in clamshell mode, was cramped to use due to its small screen, though (it was only a 13.3-incher to begin with). The Zenbook 17 Fold should, theoretically, solve that problem: It’s a 4:3 17.3-incher when unfolded and a 3:2 12.3-incher in clamshell. That also leaves more room for a spacious keyboard — my other major complaint about the X1 Fold was that the keyboard was impractically small. (The Zenbook Fold’s is bundled with the device and has 1.4mm of travel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED in clamshell mode on a black coffee table with a black couch behind it. Next to it are a black watch, a black pair of headphones, and a closed black notebook with a black pen atop. The screen displays a multicolor background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l69BdACI24hQxAeiB0B-26nvpH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146414/Zenbook_17_Fold_OLED_UX9702_Extend_mode__scenario_photo_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what it looks like folded into clamshell mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWuQPW"&gt;Inside, the Zenbook comes with 12th Gen Intel Core i7 U-Series processors and up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. It includes Asus’ “ScreenXpert 2” software (also on its recent dual-screen devices) to help you more easily split the screen and arrange its contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tim0Vi"&gt;One of the problems with thin, high-resolution devices (the Fold is 2560 x 1920) is often battery life. All those pixels suck up juice, and a smaller device tends to have less room for a large brick. The X1 Fold did not last very long. However, the Zenbook 17 has a 75Wh battery inside (which is fairly large for a product that’s less than half an inch thick and bigger than what comes in many 13-inch thin and light laptops). Asus hasn’t provided a battery life estimate yet, of course, but that’s a promising spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thJpUZ"&gt;The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED will be available in Q2 2022 with pricing to be announced. (I imagine it’ll be expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zenbook 14 OLED closed from above on a white carpet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zkHt9cdTI6_rvhFEXcy1caXoELE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146420/U3402_Chassis_design.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the Zenbook 14 OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A21Ikh"&gt;Asus announced a few more OLED Zenbooks this week, including the Zenbook 14 OLED. This one is an old-school clamshell 14-inch laptop that could serve as a daily driver for work or school. It’s available in some interesting-sounding colors (depending on which processor you choose), including Aqua Celadon, Ponder Blue, and Jade Black, with a lid inspired by “traditional Japanese craftsmanship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItFu9l"&gt;This Zenbook has a roomy 16:10, 2.8K, 90Hz display (a refresh rate that’s becoming more common on OLED laptops but is still pretty hard to find). You can buy it with either a 12th Gen Intel Core i7 P-series processor or an AMD Ryzen 5000 chip. Asus says it will meet the requirements of Intel’s Evo program (which would bode well for the battery life, in particular), and the audio has been Harmon Kardon-certified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0LmpQ"&gt;Pricing has not yet been announced for the Zenbook 14 OLED, but it’s coming in Q2 of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition has a tiny OLED display on the lid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition angled to the right on a green couch. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sy4rll8jla7sgQVb-Ap3IzPAVAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350626/akrales_211222_4945_0035.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3BIaF"&gt;Asus’s line of ultraportable Zenbooks can be hard to distinguish from one another. There are a ton of them, and they all offer a similar look and a similar package. That’s certainly not the case with the new Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition, which is designed to look like a spaceship. There’s a tiny 3.5-inch OLED display on the lid, which displays various cute space-themed animations, and there are various space-related engravings (including some Morse code) throughout the chassis. I’m not sure how practical of a purchase it will be (especially since Asus hasn’t announced the price yet), but it’s always nice to see companies stepping out of the box with creative designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssLlf5"&gt;Starting with this tiny OLED thing. It didn’t ultimately impact my user experience too much during my brief period with the Space Edition, but it is very cool to look at, and the animations really are fun — they lend a bit of a retro vibe to the whole affair. I did find the secondary screen useful when the device was closed — it displayed the date and time, which could be useful for quick reference when it was nearby, and also had a battery indicator so I knew how much juice the device had whenever I picked it up. But that’s also all information you can get easily from Windows (obviously), so it’s mostly just a neat thing to look at. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition on a green couch angled to the right, open, from above. The screen displays a supernova with the words Space Edition across the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOv9aPK8Xq1cGh9NwK7pENCEA2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121086/akrales_211222_4945_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v5Ycbt"&gt;The primary display is a 14-inch, 16:10 OLED touch panel with a 90Hz refresh rate and 2880 x 1800 resolution. Colors were accurate, and it was a very nice display to look at overall. The 90Hz refresh rate, especially at such a high resolution, really feels like a luxury and makes the scrolling experience quite smooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF87RM"&gt;Inside, the Space Edition comes with 12th-Gen Intel H-Series processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage. I’ll be able to discuss performance more during the full review process later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition keyboard seen from above.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is really, really comfortable — I miss it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The secondary screen on the lid of the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition, displaying the time 11:06, the date December 22, and a half-full battery meter." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDxNsTE82QIz0kYNiSuaj2fKzsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121095/akrales_211222_4945_0063.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See, kinda useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad on the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5uti-EN0BG8Y0_YLJAZ8VNVRTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121089/akrales_211222_4945_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad has Asus’s LED numberpad technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sS3wAp"&gt;But the Space Edition’s main calling card is its eye-catching design. It’s very cool. It’s colored in a finish called “Zero-G Titanium”, and the spacebar has a cute little planet on it. The engravings are visible, but nowhere near obnoxious enough to be distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxbNL2"&gt;The chassis also feels a notch sturdier than many Zenbooks I’ve used — it’s a line that I often find to be flimsy for its price. The screen and keyboard deck are solid, and the finish doesn’t feel plasticky at all. Asus says the Space Edition complies with the “US Space Systems Command Standard SMC-S-016A testing protocols” and can operate in “extreme climates”, so there’s that. The upgraded build hasn’t made the Zenbook too clunky, though — at 2.87 pounds, it wasn’t a problem to carry around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2CYpz"&gt; There’s a decent port selection with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2, an HDMI 2.0, a headphone jack (which not all Zenbooks have these days), and a microSD reader. There’s a 720p HD webcam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQxzgOTjIivqf0V0yMaUY-89_wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121098/akrales_211222_4945_0102.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish the two USB-C weren’t on the same side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YQIzp-xpgl5_ZuZyPDjeZfMzDEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121096/akrales_211222_4945_0076.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am happy about the headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yAsXfv"&gt;Asus always seems to be trying these funky things, and I’m generally a fan. But the Space Edition feels a bit more refined than some of those models. The engravings really do seem to be part of a subtle space aesthetic, rather than attempts to grab passerbys’ attention. And while the secondary screen could be stuck on all kinds of devices as a gimmick, it feels like it fits here. I’m not sure how much this will cost yet, so can’t make any kind of recommendation or value proposition, but I certainly enjoyed using it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zen book 14 OLED Space Edition closed, seen from above, on a green couch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rA9UXOOIhTmM0e9t5XHof8AzwiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121094/akrales_211222_4945_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lines on the lid are meant to evoke “a space capsule”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T3UnSM"&gt;The Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition is shipping in Q2 of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tH1Yi"&gt;If you’re keeping track of the ludicrous amount of things being announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;at CES this week&lt;/a&gt;, you already know there are plenty of new toys to look forward to coming down the pipeline in 2022. Though, as excited as we are, most of it is going to be &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;costly. We love the idea of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;97-inch TV&lt;/a&gt; as much as the next person, but let’s instead take a look at some great deals on tech we can own today that shouldn’t require a second mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AenlLd"&gt;Starting us off, the Google Nest Hub Max is a sizable 10-inch smart display with a loud speaker and a camera, and you can get it for $189 ($40 off) — just $10 short of its very best price from Black Friday. It’s available in chalk or charcoal colorways at this price from &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00426us.html%3Fsterm%3DX6p2ms0xpxyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkG1LVXx1ykOzY0&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Chalk%2F842552117&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1499418-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00426_us_nest_hub_max_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7sMUfbAL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is similar to the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/4/22865019/google-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt; on the smaller seven-inch Nest Hub, though the Max offers better sound quality, more screen real estate for viewing that excellent Google Photos-powered homescreen, and a camera for video calls. It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; you can buy today, especially if you value Google’s software experience and app ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SuM449"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DGxkJf"&gt;Staying in the neighborhood of smart home tech while hopping the fence to Amazon’s walled garden of products, the Ring Floodlight Camera Plus is currently on sale for $149 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1648374-REG%2Fring_b08f6gpqq7_1080p_floodlight_cam_wired.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The floodlight camera space has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many solid options&lt;/a&gt; and continues to get more competitive with a recent addition from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest&lt;/a&gt;. This camera from Ring is a more affordable counterpart to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera#2RQz7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Floodlight Cam Pro&lt;/a&gt; and features 1080p recording with bright LED lights, night vision, and weather resistance (it’s meant to live outside, of course). At this discounted price of $149, it’s a full $100 cheaper than the higher-end Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91lnlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgVeSG"&gt;Let’s shift to cameras more focused on letting the world see that lovely face of yours. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7KrsqhbL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the Elgato Facecam for $30 off on its Deal of the Day. This drops the popular streamer cam down to $170, matching its all-time low price. Speaking of matching, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0973DV11T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently matching this deal as well. The Facecam lacks a mic but offers a solid 1080p feed at 60fps with tweakable picture settings on Elgato’s Camera Hub app. It’s good enough to get a nod in our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best webcams you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, and that $30 discount helps alleviate its biggest downside, its price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VPSy8O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730597"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bKhuw5"&gt;Whether you’re streaming games or just enjoying them, good audio is one of the key factors that can give you a competitive edge or immerse you further in an expansive world. A headset is often the best solution, especially if you’re living the apartment life but like to hear every little detail without annoying your roommates or family. The wired Xbox stereo headset is a great option that’s much more affordable compared to wireless alternatives, and the 3.5mm cable gives it a no-fuss handling for Xbox consoles and Windows PCs. This extra-cool special edition released for the Xbox’s 20th anniversary is currently $59.99 ($10 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Stereo-Headset-20th-Anniversary-SE%2F639773287&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This headset matches the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20th anniversary controller launched alongside it&lt;/a&gt; and features translucent sides with green highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di9u3H"&gt;If that styling isn’t your thing, or if you need an even lower price, the standard black version with the same specs and features is just $46.49 (about $14 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-wired-gaming-stereo-headset-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-84004221%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga 9i embraces hardware shortcut buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKj8HcdcEYeFCC6b7jsKs8oG5Es=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350386/mchin_200331_4955_0026.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txda5t"&gt;Lenovo’s newest Yoga 9i convertible laptop is embracing one of the more fun trends of ‘90s and early ‘00s computer design: shortcut keys. While plenty of laptops have added handy shortcuts to the Function row on the keyboard, few are making keys that have one express purpose. Now Lenovo is planning to release a laptop in 2022 with five of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYoWRb"&gt;The 1-Click Function keys all sit to the right of the keyboard. There’s a key for switching between performance mode and a battery-sipping Smart Power mode that sacrifices a little power to boost battery life. Another key lets you toggle between light and dark mode in Windows 10 &lt;em&gt;(or 11? does this laptop ship with 10 on it?&lt;/em&gt;), and the Vibe Check (lol) key toggles between the various built-in audio profiles so you can better hear what the heck each profile actually does. The one I’d most like to see on other laptops lets you turn the background blur off and on when in video calls. Sometimes I don’t want people to see my dog sleeping directly behind me, and sometimes I do! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gnHNY"&gt;The final button was already featured in previous Yoga 9i laptops: the fingerprint scanner. Previously it was a button sort of haphazardly stuck down on the palm rest, where it was prone to accidental clicks. Now it's a little larger and corralled over to the right of the keyboard with the rest of the new single-use buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOiBaTIzbQF9PLluJjv4S3FKvjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134043/Lenovo_Yoga_9i_Gen_7_keyboard_Oatmeal.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another shot of the new shortcut buttons on the Yoga 9i.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QwYiry"&gt;While single-use keys were all the rage on desktop computers in the ‘90s and ‘00s, the adoption of laptops as the primary computer in homes saw these buttons disappear. You’ll still find them on 15-inch and above gaming laptops — and the occasional workstation, but they’re pretty rare in a slim little 14-inch number like the Yoga 9i. The addition means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;big bezel found around the keyboard of previous iterations&lt;/a&gt; is now a whole lot thinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EMPmN"&gt;The new Yoga 9i also has a touchpad that should be about 45 percent larger than last year’s, two new Thunderbolt 4 ports, and Wi-Fi 6E. It’ll be available with up to a 4K OLED IPS display and 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P CPU combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics. Lenovo says it will start at $1,399 and be available starting in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 16-inch Yoga 7i.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I0aKkn"&gt;But it won’t be the only new Yoga. The 14-inch Yoga 7i gets a refresh with the option for a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P CPU and packs in a beefy 71Wh battery with Rapid Charge Express. The 16-inch Yoga 7i looks to be more work-oriented with up to a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700H CPU. There will also be the option to tack on Intel’s new Arc A-series discrete GPU. But we haven’t gotten to test the new GPU yet, so no telling how fast it will drain the 100Wh battery. The 14-inch model will start at $949 and the 16-inch model at $899, and both will be available sometime in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IISLq3"&gt;The 13-inch Yoga 6 is also getting a minor refresh. The option for a fabric case isn’t going away, thankfully. Lenovo seemed to focus on improving its sustainability chops with the Yoga 6. Fifty percent of the plastic in the fabric case is recycled, and Lenovo claims approximately 25 percent of the batteries are made of post-consumption plastic. Lenovo’s press release says even the box it comes in will be the “greenest” ever made for a Yoga product. The laptop itself relies on AMD and can be outfitted with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U. It will start at $749 and, like the other Yoga laptops announced today, is expected to ship in Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is working with Lenovo to help you find your lost laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Lenovo ThinkPad with the Tile app on the screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIpW4P_4dvUzMz6ndgEJQfcMISA=/390x0:4611x2814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350412/Lenovo_FWT_laptop_PR2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC partnership.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tile, Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DiToR0"&gt;No one likes misplacing expensive gadgets, but especially not a laptop. If you were thinking about copping one of Lenovo’s newly announced ThinkPad X1s, good news. Tile and Lenovo are teaming up to make the computers findable via the Tile app, even when the laptops are offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKbS5"&gt;This is Tile’s second embedded PC collaboration — the first was with HP. As for which Lenovo laptops are compatible, the list includes the X1 Carbon 10th gen, X1 Yoga 7th gen, and the X1 Nano 2nd gen. To enable the feature, download and install the Tile Windows app from the Microsoft Store. From there, activate the ThinkPad as if it were a Tile tracker. Once that’s done, should you misplace your shiny new laptop, you can find it using the Tile app for iOS or Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWqK1q"&gt;One neat perk is that the laptop remains findable even if it’s shut down or offline for up to 14 days. However, because it acts like one of Tile’s own trackers, there are some limitations. One of the handier Tile features is to ring your lost device. You can do that with the Lenovo PCs as well, except it has to be within Bluetooth range or 250 feet. If you’re outside that range, Tile says you can view the most recent location or “enlist the secure help of Tile’s global network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVlIMS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fwhat-is-tile-network-community-find-lost-stolen-far-away&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22859022%2Ftile-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-findable-laptops-lost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tile’s network&lt;/a&gt; works similarly to Apple’s FindMy network in that it relies on other nearby Tile devices to find a device that’s out of range. It’s just not quite as effective, given that there aren’t as many Tile users as there are iPhones (for what it’s worth, Tile says its Find with Tile business has expanded to over 40 different third-party devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi4CKt"&gt;In any case, if this is a feature you want, you’ll have to wait a bit. Lenovo’s new ThinkPad X1s won’t be available until March, and the Tile integration isn’t backward compatible with older ThinkPads. It’s probably not the number one reason why you’d want a new ThinkPad, but hey, at least the feature is free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tr2Nrq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s 16-inch Legion 5 Pro is about to get even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-8fLh5Fnpc6vIfruYvvqNFe5LI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350367/lenovolegion5pro1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aLXGdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;Lenovo impressed us in 2021 with its Legion 5 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a 16-inch QHD+ laptop that delivered excellent gaming performance at a price that undercut many of its key competitors, like Razer and Asus. It also got bonus points for being powerful without being too thick or heavy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knRT6B"&gt;Like many companies during CES 2022, Lenovo is upgrading the specs of its Legion 5 Pro for this year, and despite my never-dying thirst for new chassis design, it seems like Lenovo may have another hit on its hands without having to change all that much (here’s to hoping Lenovo stocks it at more retailers than just Walmart). Though, according to the company, the chassis is thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2obWvC"&gt;The new Legion 5 Pro will be available in the standard storm grey colorway with four-zone RGB key backlighting. New for 2022 is a glacier white colorway with blue backlighting, which looks lovely. Lenovo hasn’t shared the pricing for this model yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggR2B-rif7z9N7piyBDF9UNKjQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134323/lenovolegion5pro2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New for 2022 is a glacier white colorway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U0bD0e"&gt;Getting into the specs, the Legion 5 Pro for 2022 will once again support the latest AMD Ryzen processors, up to the Ryzen 9 6900HX. It’s actually making an Intel-based version, too, called the Legion 5i Pro (the “i” is for Intel). That model will support up to Intel’s 12th-Gen Core i9-12900H. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lb96l8"&gt;In the graphics department, Lenovo says both laptops will support up to the Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip that can draw a total graphics power of 150W (Lenovo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this is subject to change per additional testing ahead of its release) at a boosted clock speed of 1485MHz, which should push it well beyond what last generation’s model is capable of in terms of graphical fidelity at QHD+ resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM8Nib"&gt;Last year’s Legion 5 Pro was one of the first gaming laptops to ship with a 16-inch IPS screen that had a 16:10 aspect ratio. Now it claims that the 2022 Legion 5 Pro and 5i Pro are the first gaming laptops to offer variable refresh rate displays, supporting up to a 240Hz refresh rate at that QHD+ resolution. Other notable display specs include a 3ms response time, DisplayHDR 400 with up to 500 nits of brightness, and 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color space. I can’t wait to see games running on this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 5 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrQv_nPpfkUTwWSrQcL8RP-xwH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134328/lenovolegion5pro3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is well stocked with ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol2VXs"&gt;Like many gaming laptops being announced at CES 2022, the Legion 5 Pro and 5i Pro support up to 32GB of fast DDR5 RAM clocked at a lightning-fast 4,800MHz and can be configured with up to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. Other laptop makers support up to 2TB or, in some cases, up to 4TB of total storage, so it’s disappointing to see Lenovo falling behind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6EZkI"&gt;One other feature I’m unsure about with the Legion 5 Pro is battery life. Compared to other Ryzen Zen 3-packed laptops, I thought that the 2021 laptop delivered middling battery life. Once again, the 2022 model has an 80Wh battery, though Lenovo more than doubled the wattage for charging it via USB-C, from 65W to 135W. So, at least quickly topping it up won’t be an issue, and you won’t need to lug around its 230W adapter to do so (unless you plan to do some serious gaming). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpZ1Bo"&gt;In terms of ports, both configurations have two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with DP 1.4 video support on the left side (on the 5i Pro, one of those parts is Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4), while an extra USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port on the rear supports DP 1.4 and PD charging up to 135W. Also on the rear are two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an RJ45 ethernet port, and a power plug. Over on the right, there’s one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port, alongside a headphone jack and an electronic kill switch for the 720p webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwHVSB"&gt;There are a lot of gaming laptops that we’ll be testing in early 2022, and I’m particularly excited to see if Lenovo’s new version of the Legion 5 Pro is as good as the last.&lt;/p&gt;
