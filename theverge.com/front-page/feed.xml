    <title>Fossil doesn’t plan to upgrade its existing watches to the new Wear OS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ya4PjtMeckQ6rkqMwOGZyg6QrC0=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69412817/fossil_watch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvt3Ci"&gt;Fossil executives Greg McKelvey and Steve Prokup &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fossil-is-planning-a-premium-google-watch-for-fall/"&gt;said in an interview with CNET&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s existing Wear OS watches won’t get upgraded to the new combined Wear software platform from Samsung and Google. Instead, Fossil is planning a premium watch that Prokup said would have “pretty major hardware upgrades,” and existing watches will probably be discounted as budget options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgL86r"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNET,&lt;/em&gt; Fossil’s Gen 6 watch should have features similar to upcoming watches from Google and Samsung, with faster performance, longer battery life, new chips, and LTE cellular options. “All of the software benefits that Google’s talking about and launching with the unified platform is something we’ll be building into that as well,” McKelvey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxQjVW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google and Samsung announced last month&lt;/a&gt; at Google I/O that they would combine Wear OS and Samsung’s Tizen into a new platform, creating one central smartwatch OS for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kuqLt"&gt;The Fossil execs didn’t give much insight into what buttons or crowns the company may use in its next Wear OS watch. ”I think you’re still going to see a variety of offerings across even our products, as well as manufacturers,” Prokup said in the interview, “not so much that you’re going to have a watch that ends up having four, five, six dedicated buttons or no buttons.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter blocked in Nigeria after deleting a tweet by its president </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZp21XpU6txa9U-OX0bUhUeWYeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410594/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture. The move comes days after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;removed a threatening tweet&lt;/a&gt; by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNfuo1"&gt;On Saturday, the office of Nigeria’s attorney general and ministry of justice said it would arrest and prosecute anyone who tried to get around the block, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;, and directed government agencies to cooperate with prosecutors “to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.” Several news reports said people within Nigeria &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57368535"&gt;were using VPNs&lt;/a&gt; to try to avoid the ban and continue using Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYudQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;— Fed Min of Info &amp;amp; Cu (@FMICNigeria) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843065364029446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQTzgj"&gt;In Buhari’s deleted tweet, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-presidents-tweet-was-deleted"&gt;he suggested he would punish&lt;/a&gt; secessionists. “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Biafra war,” he wrote. “Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” Buhari was a major general during the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51094093"&gt;Biafra war&lt;/a&gt;, which left more than a million people dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emAxut"&gt;Twitter’s Public Policy team said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?s=20"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday it was “deeply concerned” and would work to restore access in Nigeria. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter-operations-information-minister-2021-06-04"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that Twitter’s website was not accessible on some of Nigeria’s mobile carriers, but appeared to be working sporadically on other carriers in Lagos and Abuja, two of the country’s biggest cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ICrSyl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenInternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OpenInternet&lt;/a&gt; is an essential human right in modern society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeepitOn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KeepitOn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psgpRx"&gt;“Suspending Twitter in Nigeria is just one more way of stating that people’s rights do not matter just what the State wants,” Osai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International in Nigeria &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/livingtruely/status/1400887522398543881?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a dangerous precedent and must be called out for what it is.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmnestyNigeria/status/1400862127456391168?s=20"&gt;Amnesty called on Nigerian authorities&lt;/a&gt; to immediately reverse the suspension, “and other plans to gag the media, repress civic space, and undermine Nigerians’ human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5GW2"&gt;In April, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa.html"&gt;opened its first office in Africa&lt;/a&gt; in Ghana, which some in Nigeria considered a snub. In its announcement, Twitter cited Ghana’s support of free speech, online freedom and the Open Internet as the reasons for its decision. Nigeria’s information minister &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/media-portrayal-nigeria-led-twitter-choose-ghana-africa-office-minister-2021-04-16/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter’s decision not to locate its Africa offices in Nigeria was due to misrepresentation of the country by the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2r6v8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/nigeria/report-nigeria/"&gt;According to a 2020 report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, Nigerian authorities “used repressive laws to harass, intimidate, arrest and detain human rights defenders, activists, media workers and perceived critics. Non-state actors also subjected journalists to intimidation, harassment and beatings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUYyqc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 5th, 4:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that the Nigerian government plans to arrest and prosecute people who try to get around the Twitter ban.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department has charged a Latvian woman it says helped develop Trickbot malware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCNku2R9vsTWIh253P7XdCvDmOg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69411518/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3oO9u"&gt;The US Department of Justice has charged a Latvian woman for her role in allegedly developing the Trickbot malware, which was responsible for infecting millions of computers, targeting schools, hospitals, public utilities, and governments, the agency said &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3106W"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Alla Witte was part of a criminal organization known as the Trickbot Group that operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname. She allegedly helped develop the malware which was used to enable ransomware demands and payments. Victims would receive a notice that their computers were encrypted, the DOJ said, and were directed to buy special software through a bitcoin address linked to the Trickbot Group to have their files decrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrBJGL"&gt;According to the DOJ, the Trickbot malware was designed to capture online banking login credentials to gain access to other personal information including credit card numbers, emails, passwords, Social Security numbers, and addresses. The group allegedly used stolen personal information “to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign beneficiary accounts,” the DOJ said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TG3bzV"&gt;Federal law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540026/cyberattack-ransomware-hospitals-russia-covid"&gt;warned hospitals and healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; last October of a credible ransomware threat by attackers using Trickbot &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a"&gt;to deploy ransomware such as Ryuk and Conti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfNZMV"&gt;Witte was arrested February 6th in Miami. She is charged with 19 counts including conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud affecting a financial institution, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square will invest $5 million to build solar-powered bitcoin mining facility</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7riNt0Rzjg8f1t1S-W4AUX7yw3U=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69411289/blockstream_square.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square and Blockstream are partnering on a solar-powered bitcoin mining facility | Blockstream&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MRGG5X"&gt;Financial services firm Square Inc. will partner with blockchain technology provider Blockstream Mining to build an open-source, solar-powered bitcoin mining facility, Blockstream &lt;a href="https://blockstream.com/2021/06/05/en-blockstream-and-square-inc-join-forces-for-solar-powered-bitcoin-mining/"&gt;announced in a press release&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. Square confirmed the news in a tweet, saying it was “committed to driving further adoption and efficiency of renewables within the bitcoin ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cboLyV"&gt;According to the release, Square will invest $5 million in the facility, which will be a “proof-of-concept for a 100% renewable energy Bitcoin mine at scale,” and will be built at one of Blockstream’s sites in the US. “We hope to show that a renewable mining facility in the real world is not only possible but also prove empirically that Bitcoin accelerates the world toward a sustainable future,” the release states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJRYsa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Together, we'll be creating a public-facing dashboard to serve as a transparent case study for renewable energy and bitcoin mining. As we continue to explore the synergies between the two, we're excited to share our ongoing learnings and real world data points. (2/2)&lt;/p&gt;— Square (@Square) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1401222540253532169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaWQo"&gt;Bitcoin mining uses a lot of electricity, and the pursuit of sustainable methods for mining it is top of mind for many in the industry. Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk said in April&lt;/a&gt; the automaker would stop accepting bitcoin as payment for vehicles (after having the policy in place for roughly a month), noting that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin “come at great costs to the environment.” He met with bitcoin miners in May, and the group agreed to form a Bitcoin Mining Council, “to promote energy usage transparency [and] accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Su8Pk"&gt;Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter, is another big proponent of bitcoin (it’s the only word in his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack"&gt;Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt; at the moment), saying in 2018 that he thinks bitcoin will become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;the world’s single currency within 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. Square invested $50 million in bitcoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; , adding another $170 million &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297935/square-bitcoin-purchase-170-million-investment-cryptocurrency"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. Users of Square’s Cash app can use it to buy bitcoin. And during remote testimony before Congress in March, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350705/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-clock-house-hearing-blockclock-mini"&gt;bitcoin clock could be seen &lt;/a&gt;in the background of Dorsey’s video stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjRUiy"&gt;On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518982/twitter-blue-subscription-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-wallets"&gt;Dorsey tweeted that Square&lt;/a&gt; was “considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin” building it entirely in the open and in collaboration with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xvwlc3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly warns Twitter of ‘unintended consequences’ if it fails to follow new rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUpOfB-Fyt-AdUoV0EUT7Ej-M2s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69411075/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2BIW6"&gt;India’s government has told Twitter it could face “unintended consequences” if it fails to comply with the country’s new social media rules, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-twitter-comply-with-it-rules-or-face-unintended-consequences-2021-06-05/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; India’s technology minister wrote in a June 5th letter to Twitter that the company’s responses to previous government letters about the new rules did not confirm whether Twitter was in full compliance, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f38IJN"&gt;Under India’s Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/whatsapp-reportedly-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-end-privacy.html"&gt;took effect in May&lt;/a&gt;, social media companies could be subject to legal action if they fail to follow the code’s provisions, which are aimed at regulating the platforms’ content. The new rules call for platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a legal order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBellz"&gt;The rules also require the companies to have a grievance officer who acknowledges users’ complaints within 24 hours, a chief compliance officer, and a contact person who would be available to law enforcement agencies 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L34WJQ"&gt;The June 5th letter to Twitter said the company had not yet met the requirements for the new roles, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported, and could results in India holding Twitter legally liable for content on its platform. But the letter stated that “as gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice to immediately comply with the Rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="993BRH"&gt;Twitter has tangled with the Indian government on several fronts in recent months. In April, the social platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;removed tweets critical&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and did so at the government's request. And late last month, police in the Indian cities of Delhi and Guragon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter offices&lt;/a&gt; there as part of an investigation into why some tweets by government officials were labeled as “manipulated media” under Twitter’s policy. There were no employees in the offices at the time, as Twitter employees in India were working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noQ7Gq"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLVkyX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers reportedly used a compromised password in Colonial Pipeline cyberattack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dckft0"&gt;An analysis of the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline found that the hackers were able to access the company’s network using a compromised VPN password, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The hack led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;ransomware payout of $4.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, and resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gas-prices-hit-3-a-gallon-as-shortage-sets-in-amid-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-11620832180"&gt;gas prices around $3 per gallon&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in several years at US gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTOhAS"&gt;According to cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the VPN account didn’t use multi-factor authentication, which allowed the hackers to access Colonial’s network with a compromised username and password. It’s not clear whether the hackers discovered the username or were able to figure it out independently. The password was discovered among a batch of passwords leaked on the dark web, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7TtaW"&gt;The breach occurred April 29th, according to Mandiant, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;discovered on May 7th&lt;/a&gt; by a control room employee who saw the ransomware note. That prompted the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;take the pipeline offline&lt;/a&gt; to contain the potential threat. Close to half of the fuel in the eastern US travels through the affected pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4dajG"&gt;In response to the hack, the Transportation Security Administration put a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/27/1000694357/in-wake-of-colonial-attack-pipelines-now-must-report-cybersecurity-breaches"&gt;new policy into place&lt;/a&gt; requiring pipeline operators to report cyberattacks to the government within 12 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anCoec"&gt;Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount is &lt;a href="https://homeland.house.gov/activities/hearings/cyber-threats-in-the-pipeline-using-lessons-from-the-colonial-ransomware-attack-to-defend-critical-infrastructure"&gt;scheduled to appear&lt;/a&gt; before the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 9th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise gets permit from California to provide passenger test rides in driverless vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwdI3B"&gt;The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) it has authorized General Motors-owned self-driving vehicle company Cruise to provide driverless passenger service to the public in its robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNdgvL"&gt;The CPUC said Cruise is the first entrant in its driverless pilot program, which lets companies give test rides in vehicles without drivers. Under the terms of the program, Cruise may not charge passengers for the rides, and the company must submit quarterly reports to the CPUC about the vehicles’ operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk04DI"&gt;Cruise has been testing its driverless vehicles in San Francisco, and last month &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-waymo-cruise-seek-permits-charge-self-driving-car-rides-san-francisco-2021-05-11/"&gt;applied for a permit&lt;/a&gt; that will allow the company to charge for autonomous rides and deliveries in the area. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;unveiled its Cruise Origin&lt;/a&gt;, a  prototype vehicle without a steering wheel, pedals, or any controls typically associated with human driving last year. It’s slated to begin production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; starting in &lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2021/05/13/cruise-plans-start-making-autonomous-origin-shuttle-2023/5078848001/"&gt;early 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, most of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/gms-cruise-begins-testing-autonomous-vehicles-without-human-drivers-in-san-francisco.html"&gt;Cruise’s driverless test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; are Chevrolet Bolt EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaEe5Z"&gt;In addition to Cruise, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/avcissued/"&gt;seven other companies&lt;/a&gt;, which include Google spinoff Waymo, Zoox, owned by Amazon, and Aurora, have CPUC permits to test driverless vehicles on roads in California, but only Cruise is permitted to provide rides to passengers without a driver on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMqyN8"&gt;In California, companies need permits from both the CPUC and the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to test driverless vehicles (and eventually, to get the vehicles on the road with passengers). A total of &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"&gt;55 companies have active permits&lt;/a&gt; from the DMV to test driverless vehicles in California, including Cruise, but so far Nuro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;is the only company&lt;/a&gt; to receive a deployment permit from the DMV that allows it to operate its autonomous vehicles in California commercially. That deployment permit doesn’t allow Nuro to transport passengers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfEDar"&gt;In January, Microsoft announced a long-term strategic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238407/microsoft-cruise-self-driving-investment-azure-cloud"&gt;partnership with Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was joining a $2 billion funding round that pushed Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI is trying to get IP addresses and phone numbers of people who read a USA Today article</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnGltTEjwvFv3g0I5JXRG7ieV08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410733/acastro_200218_3900_StoryStream_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvLENO"&gt;The FBI is trying to get a list of IP addresses, phone numbers, and other information on people who read a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article about the deaths of two of its agents (&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/03/usa-today-subpeona-florida-shooting-491847"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf"&gt;The subpoena&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) says it relates to a criminal investigation, and is seeking the information of readers who accessed the article in a specific 35-minute timespan, but it’s unclear who or what the Bureau is trying to track down. &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; is fighting back against handing over the information, calling the request unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE4VfF"&gt;“We were surprised to receive this subpoena particularly in light of President Biden’s recent statements in support of press freedom.  The subpoena is also contrary to the Justice Department’s own guidelines concerning the narrow circumstances in which subpoenas can be issued to the news media,” &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; publisher Maribel Perez Wadsworth said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plNW1z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/02/sunrise-florida-shooting-fbi-agents-injured/4352344001/"&gt;The article in question&lt;/a&gt; was one published on February 2nd, 2021, about a shootout that occurred when FBI agents &lt;a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/02/04/source-fbi-shooting-suspect-david-huber-sunrise/"&gt;tried to execute a search warrant&lt;/a&gt; in a child pornography case, resulting in the deaths of two FBI agents and the suspect. The subpoena, filled by an FBI special agent, requests a large amount of information about the devices that accessed the article from 7:03PM ET to 7:38PM ET on the evening it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t-LuODuCYiS_6InAhGehAV40GT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638577/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_4.09.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the subpoena, which the FBI sent to a closed office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bFXkXX"&gt;It’s unclear why the request was made, given that the suspect described in the article was, by the time the article was published, reported to be dead. Whatever the FBI is looking for, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; says &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.0.pdf"&gt;in its court filing&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that the request violates the First Amendment, citing multiple rulings from previous cases where the government was not allowed access to similar records. It also argues that the FBI accessing the general records of who read a story could put a cooling effect on its journalistic efforts — as a Supreme Court Justice cited in the motion put it in 1953, the government asking for this kind of information can make people feel like someone is reading over their shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUCoNE"&gt;Perez Wadsworth said in the statement that &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;’s attorneys attempted to contact the FBI before moving forward to fight the subpoena in court. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Despite these attempts, we never received any substantive reply nor any meaningful explanation of the asserted basis for the subpoena,” she said. “We intend to fight the subpoena’s demand for identifying information about individuals who viewed the USA TODAY news report. Being forced to tell the government who reads what on our websites is a clear violation of the First Amendment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiCLaT"&gt;She added that USA Today has asked the court to quash the subpoena “to protect the important relationship and trust between USA TODAY’s readers and our journalists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZXklV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtqAIC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memorials to honor COVID-19 dead begin to take shape</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The National Covid Memorial Wall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPurKEdqDAgxtXUkwi5KvCp-g_I=/0x0:4724x3149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410634/1233138114.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAM853"&gt;How can we possibly memorialize the brutal toll of COVID-19? It’s something I’ve been thinking about this week. The US observed Memorial Day on May 31, honoring people who died in military service. Artists, politicians, and activists are now starting to think about how to memorialize the more than 3.7 million people around the world who have died of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whaazx"&gt;Temporary memorials have already sprung up over the past 18 months, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/coronavirus-deaths-covid-memorials-remembering-victims.html"&gt;with flags, painted hearts, and pictures honoring the dead&lt;/a&gt;. But plans for new, more permanent memorials are starting to take shape. Some are massive structures, others are quiet gardens, and still others will be incorporated into spaces already dedicated to memorializing people who have died. In the UK, plans are being discussed for a &lt;a href="https://guernseypress.com/news/uk-news/2021/05/12/boris-johnson-sets-out-plans-for-coronavirus-memorials/"&gt;memorial in London&lt;/a&gt; at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Last August, a team in Uruguay announced plans to build a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/940802688/hardly-any-1918-flu-memorials-exist-will-we-remember-covid-19-differently"&gt;large-scale memorial to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in Montevideo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A concave concrete bowl with a hole in the middle is built out over the coast." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIuhCvCT-XlZ7_T6JuyVqhbScWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639357/01_MMP_IMAGEN.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GomezPlatero&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An artist’s impression of what the memorial in Montevideo might look like. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r8BJlp"&gt;Whatever form those memorials end up taking, they’ll occupy a unique place in the memorial landscape. Compared to other tributes, disease memorials are relatively rare. There are almost no memorials to the millions who died during the 1918 flu pandemic, and the few that do exist &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/1918-flu-memorials.html"&gt;were only installed recently&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjTg2a"&gt;Unlike diseases, wars, attacks, and disasters are usually finite, tied to a particular place, or a defined time. Memorials to those kinds of events can be set up at specific places. Diseases, on the other hand, can be more pervasive, spreading throughout whole regions or populations. There’s no equivalent to Ground Zero for COVID-19, just like there wasn’t for the flu that ravaged the world in 1918. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giau92"&gt;Many diseases are &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/sociology-disease-disgust-shame"&gt;also stigmatized&lt;/a&gt;, making them &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20200617/lessons-from-hiv-ebola-can-help-mitigate-covid19-stigma"&gt;harder for people to talk about&lt;/a&gt;. In the past few decades, public memorials have helped break through that stigma. Forty years ago today, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a1.htm#:~:text=Twenty%20years%20ago%2C%20on%20June,homosexuals%22%3B%20two%20had%20died."&gt;first reports&lt;/a&gt; of a different epidemic — HIV/AIDS — were published by the CDC. The disease tore through the gay community, and homophobia and fear left patients and their loved ones ostracized. &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/artery/2015/05/01/aids-memorials"&gt;The AIDS quilt&lt;/a&gt;, first displayed in 1987, showed the world the devastation of the epidemic, and helped pressure officials to do something about the disease, instead of ignoring the growing death toll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaCpAT"&gt;COVID-19 memorials are being built in a different environment than the ones built by AIDS activists in the 1980s. Research into COVID-19 is well-funded, and the societal pressures between the two are nothing alike. What they do have in common is a need for a space to mourn.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VhbZKw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;establishing memorials can be a part of helping societies heal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3ajuW"&gt;Other deadly outbreaks have shown that establishing memorials can be a part of helping societies heal after devastating and disruptive loss. As a part of efforts to combat Ebola, experts &lt;a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/51580/1007-3384-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;recommended that memorials&lt;/a&gt; be established in affected regions, to give communities a safe space to mourn their dead. Cemeteries and memorials for people who died of Ebola were &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30626732"&gt;established in Liberia&lt;/a&gt; and other countries. Similar plans could help comfort people grieving loved ones lost to COVID-19, who may have had to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-57362876"&gt;forgo funeral rituals&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oW70hZ"&gt;Some COVID-19 memorials are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/jersey-city-announces-plan-for-covid-19-memorial-park-at-former-superfund-site/2760964/"&gt;already taking shape&lt;/a&gt;, from gardens and parks to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/arts/design/coronavirus-memorials-italy-britain.html"&gt;steel statues&lt;/a&gt;. Others may take longer to come together. Advisory committees are being set up to plan for memorials across the US, from &lt;a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2021/03/24/long-beach-mayor-announces-forthcoming-covid-19-memorial-project-to-honor-those-who-have-died/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/546783-new-york-plans-to-build-memorial-to-covid-19-essential-workers"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/11/22170479/hart-island-covid-memorial-new-york-city-potters-field"&gt;Ideas for a COVID-19 memorial&lt;/a&gt; in New York City at the city’s public burial grounds are still in their infancy (The city’s sanitation department — hard-hit by the pandemic — recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/nyregion/nyc-virus-memorials.html"&gt;unveiled its own memorial&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBsGiE"&gt;All these monuments, made of steel and stone, and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-57133573"&gt;living wood&lt;/a&gt; will be designed to honor people who are gone, or who contributed to the efforts to stop the pandemic. There will be plaques and parks, statues and stained glass, all trying to comprehend something that is incomprehensible. Any effort will be complicated by the sheer immensity of the task at hand. The number of dead that need to be memorialized continues to grow, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22424422/pandemic-covid-coronavirus-death-toll-estimate-antivirus"&gt;may never be known fully&lt;/a&gt;. Anything we come up with will only be an echo of the vast loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDikyW"&gt;“Even if we could come up with a complete census of COVID’s victims,” author and journalist Justin Davidson &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/03/covid-memorial-project-design-pandemic.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Curbed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year, “inscribing all their names would require a wall the size of Hoover Dam” &lt;/p&gt;

Hospitalizations among kids aged 12-17 went up earlier this year, and the CDC is urging people in this age group to get the vaccine.  (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are remarkably accurate, but scaling up the program might be challenging. (Linda Geddes/&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, they’ll get named after the Greek alphabet, which will also cut down on the use of location-specific names that can play into harmful stigmas. (As a weird side note, this decision comes soon after authorities decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336459/greek-alphabet-storm-names-hurricane-season-world-meteorological-organization"&gt;ditch the Greek alphabet&lt;/a&gt; for naming hurricanes.)

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="76uI31"&gt;The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a controversial anti-hacking law which bans “exceeding authorized access” on a computer system, was narrowed by the Supreme Court on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf"&gt;in a 6-3 ruling&lt;/a&gt;. The court said the law shouldn’t cover people misusing systems they’re allowed to access — and that claiming otherwise would criminalize a “breathtaking amount” of everyday computer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08PEaS"&gt;The court case, &lt;em&gt;Van Buren v. United States&lt;/em&gt;, concerns a former Georgia police officer named Nathan Van Buren. Van Buren accepted $5,000 in exchange for looking up a woman’s license plate in a police database. (The deal was actually an FBI sting operation, and the plate number was fictitious.) Because the exchange violated department rules, prosecutors said Van Buren had “exceeded access” to the system. Van Buren’s lawyers argued that whether or not he misused the database, he was authorized to access it — and therefore hadn’t violated anti-hacking laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ERxoqW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cases should be judged on gate-crashing systems, not misusing data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65fQiI"&gt;The Supreme Court’s majority opinion, delivered by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, concurred. It backed a “gates-up-or-down” approach to authorization: accessing parts of a system that are specifically forbidden breaks CFAA rules, but simply accessing authorized areas in an unapproved way does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCb4Ln"&gt;Barrett’s opinion noted that people routinely bend or break the rules of computers and web services. “The government’s interpretation of the ‘exceeds authorized access’ clause would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity,” she wrote. “If the ‘exceeds authorized access’ clause criminalizes every violation of a computer-use policy, then millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens are criminals.” The law could cover an employee who sends a personal email on a work computer, for example, or “criminalize everything from embellishing an online dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6XT2nm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It could “criminalize everything from embellishing an online dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDRPs1"&gt;Legal experts and civil liberties advocates broadly praised the overall ruling. “This is an important victory for civil liberties and civil rights enforcement in the digital age,” said Esha Bhandari, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project deputy director. Electronic Frontier Foundation staff members Aaron Mackey and Kurt Opsahl also &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security"&gt;called the decision&lt;/a&gt; a victory, saying the court “provided good language that should help protect researchers, investigative journalists, and others.” (Both organizations previously filed briefs supporting Van Buren.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTwcuR"&gt;CFAA can be used to crack down on legitimately malicious hacking, but it’s also notoriously vague, and different charges can carry penalties of up to 5, 10, or 20 years in prison. Critics argue that this combination threatens researchers and other people who use freely accessible information in unapproved ways. Federal prosecutors can stack up intimidating charges against targets, as was the case with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/01/aaron-swartz-cfaa-a-year-after-aaron-swartz-s-death-the-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-remains-unchanged.html"&gt;activist Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide in 2013 while facing prosecution. Companies can also use it to &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/how-strange-secretive-cult-company-waging-legal-war-against-journalists/"&gt;harass journalists&lt;/a&gt; or employees that leak documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E3yy6A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CFAA’s definition of hacking was notoriously broad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E75c0Y"&gt;In theory, prosecutors now have to establish that users actually accessed parts of a system they were barred from entering. “I think it’s a really substantial deal,” Cornell University Law School professor James Grimmelmann tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It really clarifies that employees using computers disloyally is not a CFAA issue, and that blows away an enormous piece of criminal and civil use of the CFAA.” The ruling could also affect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859399/linkedin-hiq-data-scraping-cfaa-lawsuit-ninth-circuit-ruling"&gt;cases involving scraping&lt;/a&gt;, or mass-collecting publicly available data from websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnBRtA"&gt;Employees may still be guilty of other offenses, like stealing trade secrets, says Grimmelmann, and data scrapers could face CFAA charges if their activities cause a site to become inaccessible. But &lt;em&gt;Van Buren&lt;/em&gt; raises the bar for what’s considered criminal hacking. “You get rid of a huge swathe of things that are not really high-tech, dangerous hacker crimes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nbsJHL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is a gate? It’s an open question&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOzAZB"&gt;The ruling also leaves crucial questions unanswered, though. The court’s decision didn’t ultimately rest on the law’s overall impact or validity. It focused on a dictionary definition of one word (“so”) to decide if “exceeding authorized access” should be defined like a similar ban on computer use “without authorization” — which uses the gate metaphor. And while it says violators must have bypassed some metaphorical “gate,” it doesn’t firmly define these gates. On Twitter, Berkeley Law professor and CFAA expert Orin Kerr &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1400461828807741455"&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; a footnote that implies gates could be technical barriers &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; rules in a contract — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1400462972372193290"&gt;in Kerr’s words&lt;/a&gt;, something as potentially broad as “do not access this computer for a bad purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sW7zhu"&gt;“It is still an open question whether the restriction on access has to be technological or contractual,” says former EFF staff member and computer crime attorney Hanni Fakhoury. As Fakhoury notes, the ruling does say it’s not necessarily “plausible” for the CFAA to hinge on fine semantic distinctions in private contracts. “It certainly seems to me they’re uneasy about the idea that the CFAA would somehow become a tool to criminalize contractual obligations,” he concludes. But it leaves this big question for lower courts to debate — at least until another case reaches the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
