    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake for PS4 and PS5 is half off through August 19th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SSqJ1d"&gt;If you haven’t yet played the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, now is a good time to jump in since you can get the game for up to half off its usual cost. Square Enix has slashed the price of the digital copy of the base game for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free, with &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-guide/22524412/ff7-intergrade-save-transfer-data-download-ps5-ps4"&gt;your game saves intact&lt;/a&gt;) down to $30. This matches the best deal we’ve seen yet for the digital version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPXOSg"&gt;Though, if you’re a PS5 owner and want access to the &lt;em&gt;Integrade &lt;/em&gt;downloadable content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;containing a new episode focused on Yuffie&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a great deal for you, too. Normally $70, you can get the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; for $50 — essentially making the Yuffie-focused episode a complimentary goodie on top of the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgRSm1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; launched in April 2020 for the PS4, but it received a big PS5 update in June 2021 that speeds up load times and improves graphical fidelity. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;Read our review of the game right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Floods endanger millions more people than previously estimated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rescue Works At Floods In Henan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jTDLJ1VGiuLgmhoB6bLnFO3htjk=/0x165:3963x2807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677537/1330827068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiAZ6Q"&gt;Flooding poses a grave risk to tens of millions more people than researchers previously estimated. Up to 86 million more people lived in flood-prone areas around the world in 2015 compared to 2000, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03695-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiuxAD"&gt;Thanks to satellite remote sensing, researchers were able to build what they say is the most comprehensive dataset of observed floods yet. It shows that more people have moved to waterfronts where they’re at risk. The findings also suggest that older flood maps used to inform urban planning and insurance policies might be underestimating the real-world risk of flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjqvpR"&gt;Just in the past month, shockingly severe floods have taken hundreds of lives in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58056667"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/world/europe/europe-floods-germany-belgium.html"&gt;Germany, and Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. In just a few days, a year’s worth of rainfall inundated Zhengzhou, a city in China’s Henan province. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/europe/germany-deaths-europe-severe-flooding-intl/index.html"&gt;Record-smashing rainfall&lt;/a&gt; across Western Europe overwhelmed dams and nearly washed away entire towns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLzxnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9pJJ3e"&gt;“It just really hits home, the urgency of the issue,” says Colin Doyle, one of the authors of the new study and the director of technology at Cloud to Street, a flood tracking and risk analytics platform. “It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue — both adapting to the events and also creating infrastructure as a safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP1yeK"&gt;The proportion of people living in flood-prone places grew by 20 to 24 percent since 2000, according to the new research. That’s up to ten times as much as previous studies had estimated. That rise was driven by a few different factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWk9am"&gt;First, satellites have given scientists a better view of flood events. In the past, most flood maps relied on models and not observations of actual floods. Now, with more satellites in space and greater cloud computing ability, researchers like Doyle have new tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6zIwH"&gt;For their comprehensive global study, Doyle and his co-authors were able to look back at images taken daily by two NASA satellites to study floods that took place between 2000 and 2018. They paired that with data on population growth in affected areas to come to their findings. (An interactive Global Flood Database went live today to accompany the new study. On the database &lt;a href="https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, you can explore the new maps that Doyle and colleagues put together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp2o57"&gt;The satellite data also allowed Doyle and his co-authors to look at more kinds of floods than typical flood maps. They included flooding from dam failures, snow melt, and surface water floods. Modeling, on the other hand, tends to limit traditional flood maps to hazards posed when heavy rainfall causes rivers and other bodies of water to swell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QyMLA"&gt;But the rise in flood risk that Doyle and his colleagues documented isn’t merely a reflection of technological advances. New development seems to have gotten more concentrated in flood-prone places. Population growth in those risky areas outpaced global population growth over the same period. That’s partially driven by poverty and a lack of other options for many vulnerable populations, the study notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aSE3rW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdSchH"&gt;While more accurate flood maps can give city planners a better idea of where to beef up protective infrastructure, they can also tell them where &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to build in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwuCPe"&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas,” writes Brenden Jongman, a senior disaster risk management specialist at The World Bank who reviewed the study and wrote an accompanying opinion article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGMG1S"&gt;There’s still more work that can be done to improve flood maps for big cities, both Doyle and Jongman note. The satellites had a harder time peering down into densely packed areas. “If you’re above New York City and looking down, you’d mostly be seeing the tops of all the skyscrapers,” Doyle says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAv26"&gt;Newer commercial satellites can take images with higher resolution, but it’s still expensive for researchers to access that data. And while newer satellites might be able to take a better picture, they haven’t necessarily been up long enough to let researchers look as far back as Doyle and his colleagues were able to with NASA’s satellites.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5blrp"&gt;Hopefully, time will unlock those tools for researchers, too. They’ll need all the help they can get to forecast future flood risk. Climate change is pushing up sea levels and eating away at coastlines and river deltas that millions of people call home. Rising global average temperatures can also &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/"&gt;soup up storms&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/extreme-precipitation-and-climate-change/"&gt;intense rainfall&lt;/a&gt; in some regions. The &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study forecasts that by 2030, even more people will be exposed to dangerous flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeYBsk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s stripped down Tab S7 FE comes to the US starting at $529 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ow9NYMTjBPfZ3pJL8754_7-x8wY=/1x0:6666x4443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677239/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_Single_KV_Mystic_Black.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab S7 FE comes with a stylus in the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uszaBp"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 FE is officially coming to the US starting on Thursday for the 5G version with the Wi-Fi model expected a few weeks later, the company has announced. The specs of the stripped-back FE, or “Fan Edition,” version of Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;flagship tablet from last year&lt;/a&gt; have been public since a listing for the tablet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451398/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-germany-no-oled"&gt;appeared on its German store in May&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have full details of its US pricing and availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz3yhb"&gt;The first version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE to release in the US will be its 5G model. It’ll be available to order starting Thursday, August 5th, from AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Samsung’s own online store, with prices starting at $669. It will also be available from other retailers, as well as T-Mobile and US Cellular “in the coming days,” according to Samsung. Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi model will be priced lower at $529, and will release beginning in September. Preorders for the Wi-Fi version open Thursday. That compares to a starting price of $649 for the Tab S7 Wi-Fi, or $849 for its 5G version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQ-9hnB0L-WWgXA23ykA_aIz74o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760297/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wi-Fi version of the tablet comes in black, silver, green, and pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zg3HR"&gt;The big selling point for the Tab S7 FE is its large 12.4-inch display, which is the same size as last year’s $849 Tab S7 Plus, although it’s LCD rather than OLED. Internally the 5G version of the Tab S7 FE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G, while the Wi-Fi version has a Qualcomm SM7325 chipset. Rounding out the specs are 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, and a 10,090mAh battery. There’s an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, and a 5-megapixel camera on the front, orientated so it’s on the top while you’re using the tablet in landscape. You also get an S Pen stylus in the box, which is helpful for note taking and sketching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh2kGg"&gt;As well as the Tab S7 FE, Samsung has also announced that the 5G version of the Galaxy Book Go laptop will be available from AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon this month. AT&amp;amp;T preorders open on August 5th, while Verizon’s availability starts on August 13th. AT&amp;amp;T is selling the laptop for $799.99. It will be available to preorder on August 5th, and will be available “in the coming weeks,” AT&amp;amp;T says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PowerA’s Fusion Pro is an enthusiast Switch controller that won’t enthuse everyone</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Customization aplenty, but the omissions are hard to ignore&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hErqEB"&gt;PowerA’s $99.99 Fusion Pro for the Nintendo Switch is made for gamers who want a more customizable controller. It’s more similar to Microsoft’s Xbox Elite than Nintendo’s Switch Pro gamepad, with a handful of components you can physically swap out to better fit your preferences. For instance, if you don’t like the way that the Fusion Pro’s analog sticks feel out of the box, you’re welcome to swap them. There are two extra sticks in the zip-up case that it ships in. In addition to the two standard sticks, there’s a much taller concave stick, as well as a tall smooth convex stick that feels more like something you might find on an arcade stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="985thc"&gt;The customization doesn’t stop there. The Fusion Pro supports swappable face plates, too. The default white plate is matte textured and feels similar to many other controllers, but the black plate has a grippier texture that blends in more seamlessly with the Fusion Pro’s rubber-coated grips. The Fusion Pro is a little bigger than the Nintendo Switch Pro, but it doesn’t stray too far in ergonomics and layout. It connects wirelessly and is just as reliable as the Nintendo-made controller when it comes to long battery life, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335994/powera-nano-enhanced-nintendo-switch-pro-look-controller-review"&gt;PowerA’s smaller Nano Enhanced controller&lt;/a&gt; that I reviewed last year. PowerA claims up to 20 hours per charge, and it has no trouble meeting that metric. This controller includes a 9.8-foot USB-A to USB-C cable to recharge or to play in wired USB mode (a switch on the back of the Fusion Pro toggles between wireless and wired modes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="trxd4G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10684120"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo9SUs"&gt;The real highlight of the Fusion Pro is on its back, where up to four mappable paddles can be installed onto a removable module called the “Pro Pack” that snaps on. You can map up to four controller functions (aside from analog movement) to the paddles, making the Fusion Pro more customizable — and accessible — than other controllers made for the Switch. The module is optional, though. If you don’t want it on the controller, it pops off easily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FNQX_zrWRlw5l0Pok6ZmpSY47Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526566/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping the paddles to one of the Fusion Pro’s buttons is simple, requiring a few button presses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk8Diz"&gt;The Fusion Pro’s rear paddles came in handy in games that have complicated control schemes like &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter: Rise&lt;/em&gt;. Even in games with simpler schemes, it can sometimes just be nice to not have to reach for a button or two, and instead rely on the paddles. I enjoyed drifting around corners in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; with a paddle instead of reaching up for a shoulder button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHrmNR"&gt;Assigning functions to the paddles is simple. There’s a button on the controller’s rear that’s dedicated to programming each paddle, and the process involves holding it for three seconds until an LED lights up on the controller’s front side. Then you tap the button you’d like to have remapped, then press the paddle to which you’d like it to be assigned. In addition to being great for simplifying a controller layout, the paddles could be a boon to some people from an accessibility standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIz2VM4xZgVBMONhyNU_8x-0re8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526569/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The level of customization is tough to beat for a Switch wireless controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eZCKg3-0y9-HzmeZxCkeQePviOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526567/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll only get audio through the Fusion Pro’s 3.5mm audio jack if you’re in USB mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LisG30"&gt;You can gain a lot of utility by using the Fusion Pro, but it doesn’t come particularly cheap. At $100, it’s $30 more than Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller. It’ll be worth purchasing for people who really want a few extra levels of customization, especially since it’s not a huge price boost over Nintendo’s Switch Pro controller. But it’s missing some crucial features that some people may not be ready to cut out — and ones that Nintendo’s Pro controller has up on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="391fIP"&gt;The Fusion Pro lacks vibration, and it doesn’t feature an NFC chip to read Amiibo cards and figures in games that support that functionality. Those omissions are common among third-party controllers, but it’d all be nice to have in a controller at this price. I initially was excited to discover that the Fusion Pro has a 3.5mm audio jack, but that faded once I realized that it can only be used when it’s wired to the Switch dock with its included cable. It would have also been nice if the directional pad could be swapped out for a different one, which is something that Microsoft’s Xbox Elite controller allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGFZzz"&gt;The Fusion Pro isn’t a perfect all-in-one replacement for the Switch Pro controller, and I wouldn’t suggest that most people purchase it if their needs are already met. Though, despite its flaws, the deep level of customization that it offers makes it compelling enough if you want or need custom controls on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slim keyboards for your iPad, Xbox accessories, and more are discounted today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAgmb9zM4KoJg9Jz4JGQNG3_3HE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677146/vpavic_190829_3709_1169.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaHeL2"&gt;If you plan to get some typing done on your iPad, Apple’s Smart Keyboard might be a good accessory to pick up. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F5KCT/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Right now, it’s $115 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $44 off its usual price. It has plummeted to around $100 before, according to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, but this is a great deal if you need to buy right now. This model can work with the previous and current generation of the base 10.2-inch iPad, as well as the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Air or the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVPg0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uejlOK"&gt;For a little less, you can opt for a more protective and capable keyboard from Brydge. Its 10.2 Max Plus model supports the previous and latest generation of the iPad, and it adds not just a keyboard, but also a large trackpad. You’ll need to keep it charged, unlike the Smart Keyboard above, but each charge is said to last up to six months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;Read my colleague Sam Byford’s review of the larger version made for the 12.9-inch iPad&lt;/a&gt;, which has similar features to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PCBGhd"&gt;Antonline is still offering an excellent discount on a bundle containing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; and one of Microsoft’s new Xbox wireless controllers in a bold color. Instead of paying $165 for both separately, you can get them together for $140, saving you $25. You can choose between a bundle that has &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431921"&gt;a pulse red controller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431922"&gt;a shock blue controller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431825"&gt;one with an electric volt controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

That’s still pricier than some people may want to spend, but this product got some praise when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437846/coffee-tea-gadgets-tech-gear-accessories"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s staff shared their favorite coffee and tea-making gear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nissan cuts starting price of its electric Leaf to under $30,000  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GF0ffFfU868nwWVjT1qlu7eFLeU=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676934/ezgif_2_7b8ff710f040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The entry-level Nissan Leaf now starts at $27,400.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nissan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nET6Ee"&gt;Nissan’s Leaf 2022 range &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;starts at just $27,400&lt;/a&gt;, making it the cheapest mass market electric car currently available in the US, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/03/nissan-slashes-2022-leaf-price-below-30k-now-the-cheapest-ev-available-in-the-us/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That starting price drops to as little as $19,900 if you include the full $7,500 federal tax credit, for which Nissan vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml"&gt;are still eligible&lt;/a&gt;. These prices don’t include other charges like licensing and destination fees, or additional state-level incentives, but it’s a promising sign of how affordable electric vehicles are becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1k8F3"&gt;The exact price difference between Nissan’s 2021 and 2022 Leaf cars varies from model to model. The entry-level Leaf S, which has a 40kWh battery, has reduced by $4,270 from $31,670 to $27,400, undercutting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936110/bmw-electric-mini-cooper-ev-range-price-release"&gt;electric Mini Cooper’s starting price of $29,990&lt;/a&gt; (the electric Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-most-affordable-electric-cars-on-the-market-11619206485"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/car-lists/cheapest-evs-2021/"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; as the cheapest electric car currently available in the US). However Nissan’s biggest price drop can be found with the top-of-the-range 62kWh Leaf SL Plus, which has gone down in price by $6,570 from $43,970 to $37,400. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zncCdYFigBqA0UFN9oO5Sl-7amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760339/21LEAF7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nissan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Leaf is available with up to an estimated 226 miles of range. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zPFhm"&gt;Despite the drop in price, the specs of the new Leaf cars are broadly unchanged from previous years. You should still get an estimated 149 miles of range from the 40kWh model, or between 215 and 226 miles from the 62kWh version. However, all 2022 models now include a CHAdeMO quick-charging port, plus a portable 240-volt charging cable, which should provide more flexibility when topping up the car’s battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gzk6Ep"&gt;The Leaf is currently the only electric car Nissan sells in the US, but later this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324125/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-crossover-specs-price"&gt;it will release the Ariya&lt;/a&gt;, a new electric crossover SUV with up to 300 miles of range. Announced last year, the Ariya is due to go on sale in Japan in the middle of the year, with the US and Canada to follow and pricing starting at around $40,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyeXeH"&gt;Nissan’s 2022 Leaf is on sale now, &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;Nissan says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to (hopefully) restore your Gmail account if you lose access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMdEUMbGsyjCZNYPbWsg-OBWrWM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676764/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gtKJ5H"&gt;Losing access to your Google / Gmail account can be an incredibly frustrating and unhappy experience. When researching this article, I came across several accounts of people who had been locked out of their accounts after forgetting their passwords — and a few who had still not been able to get back in, even after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svP0el"&gt;Google does provide a list of methods to try if you’ve been locked out of your account — either because you’ve forgotten your password or because somebody has hacked into your account and changed it. Sometimes, they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kcktv"&gt;Your options beyond Google’s suggestions may be limited, so it’s best to be prepared ahead of time. Here are some suggestions to place you in the best possible position to get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T2wfAk"&gt;Back up your account regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nVKAM2"&gt;If you should ever (knock on wood) lose access to your account, it will be less of a blow — and is less likely to get your blood pressure shooting up — if you have a recent backup of your data. Google provides a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324801/gmail-download-data-back-up-save-email"&gt;means for you to download your data&lt;/a&gt; that it calls &lt;a href="https://takeout.google.com/"&gt;Takeout&lt;/a&gt;. You can download all of the data from all of your Google apps, or from some of them, or just from a single app such as Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbRPIo"&gt;The formats of the downloads vary depending on the type of data. Your email will be downloaded in the MBOX format, which can be then uploaded into another Gmail account or into most other email services or apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mWcn5L"&gt;Keep a record of your old password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jHAdHa"&gt;One of the ways Google verifies your identity if you lose your password is to ask you to type in your previous password. If it’s been a while since you changed your password (assuming you’ve ever actually changed it), it may be hard (or impossible) to remember that former password. So when you change your Google password — and it’s not a bad idea to change it regularly — keep a record of your old password somewhere safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii4UKx"&gt;A good strategy here is to use your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; — you use one, right? — to keep track of old passwords. Most password managers will offer to update the existing entry for an app when you create a new password; if possible, you can opt instead to create a new entry and then go back and edit the old one to say something like “Gmail - old password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lwPhOB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="64eb6L"&gt;If you’re not using a password manager (and if you’ve lost your password, there’s a good chance you’re not), then perhaps you can keep a list of old passwords in an encrypted file. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uspMs0"&gt;Check to see what recovery info is available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoOfK"&gt;It’s a good idea to provide Google ahead of time with as much recovery info as you feel comfortable with so that if you ever need to verify your identity, you have some choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwZHcV3G1qT-Yr29qWcRrDI_ip8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758474/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.32.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uy3Pfl"&gt;Go to your &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;Google account page&lt;/a&gt; and then click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CBXRs3"&gt;Scroll down to “Ways we can verify it’s you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E5lRzg"&gt;You’ll see whether you’ve registered a recovery phone number or a recovery email. (Note: if you entered an answer to a security question sometime in the past, you’ll see that in the listing as well; however, if you click on it, you’ll get a notice telling you that Google no longer supports security questions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fSpqaJ"&gt;If you don’t have any of these filled in, it may be a good idea to fill in at least one. If you want to be really careful, go ahead and enter your info. Here’s how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X22Zz0"&gt;Set up a recovery email account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCwCyn"&gt;Your recovery email account can be another Gmail account, another email account from a different service, or even a relative’s or friend’s account. (Make sure that relative or friend is security-savvy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Jhhcq1"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyh4xV"&gt;Type in your chosen recovery email address and click on “Verify.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NT7aEC"&gt;Google will send a six-digit verification code to the email address you entered. Go to your email, copy the code, and go back to the recovery page to enter the code. (You have 24 hours before you have to get another code.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jtw2uv"&gt;You should get a small pop-up indicating that your recovery email has been verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ITT8LLecGGmffJYwszYTSFWMdgY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758605/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_10.44.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gIzqgg"&gt;Set up a recovery phone number:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8T9xMw"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alQHGG"&gt;Click on “Add Recovery Phone” and enter the phone number in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eLBfQE"&gt;Google will text you a verification code at that phone number. Enter it in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA-X00bjfVVoj730rFTEZsRpk5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758604/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.47.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kyBxDl"&gt;Remember when you started the account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WuxyIv"&gt;If all else fails, Google may ask you approximately when you created the account. Personally, I have no idea when I started most of my Gmail accounts; if you want to check out when you started yours, probably the easiest way is to find your earliest Gmails (now, when you have access to your account) and keep that info somewhere safe. (This, of course, assumes that you haven’t been efficient enough to delete all your old emails; in that case, this won’t help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="88VOnl"&gt;In your Gmail account, go to the left-hand menu, find “All Mail,” and click on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PHd2Ek"&gt;Look in the upper-right corner for the number of emails that you have. (It will say something like “1-50 of 2,000.”) Click on that and select “Oldest.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mctaa4"&gt;Your email will now sort in the order of oldest first; if you (like me) haven’t been very good about deleting email, this should give you some idea of when you started the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTU7c49LcjSANonAL3lqSRoJA6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758621/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_3.10.43_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qn147Q"&gt;Google does &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;offer some other pieces of advice&lt;/a&gt; for those who are having trouble restoring their websites, including sending all of the info you can using your usual computer in the same location that you usually compute in and using your usual browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uLTlJo"&gt;Recover your password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W6iBqo"&gt;So what if you actually do lose your password or can’t get into your account for another reason? Well, you go to &lt;a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery"&gt;Google’s recovery page&lt;/a&gt; and start answering those questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLmfWA"&gt;Unfortunately, when I tried it on a test account, I realized that my options were limited indeed. I was first asked for the last password I had used, then for a verification code from my alternate email, a verification code from my phone, and the answer to my security question (despite Google’s assertion that it no longer used security questions). When I claimed I didn’t have any of these available, the last screen simply urged me to try again. I went through the whole rigmarole again — and was again urged to “Try again.” There was no alternative offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fuFmK"&gt;You can also try going to the “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/2402620"&gt;Can’t sign into your Google Account&lt;/a&gt;” page and selecting one or more of the choices offered to see if there are any other options offered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_TuKrDLVTbbbbc57CaEeoPPeno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758641/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_12.34.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HL3P7j"&gt;But be aware that, even if you can enter the information that Google’s bots ask for, it may not be enough. Back in 2017, tech journalist Ron Miller got locked out of his Google account; in an article, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/that-time-i-got-locked-out-of-my-google-account-for-a-month/"&gt;he described his considerable travails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlw5q4"&gt;So what can you do? If you really want to keep your emails — and other Google data — available, make sure you have as many ways to restore your account as possible, and don’t forget to back it all up, just in case. Otherwise, after trying everything you can, you may have to do what Google suggests at the bottom of its “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;Tips to complete account recovery steps&lt;/a&gt;” page — and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7564124"&gt;create a new account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9psgb"&gt;Sony’s $499 PlayStation 5 console is no longer selling at a loss. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-04/sony-raises-profit-outlook-as-gaming-demand-stays-resilient?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki shared the news just a week after the company announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;sold 10 million PS5 consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gx8Lr"&gt;While the PS5 with a disc drive is no longer selling for less than the cost to produce it, the less expensive and disc-less $399 PS5 Digital Edition is reportedly on track to have Sony’s related losses offset by other hardware sales like accessories and the PS4. Sony sold 500,000 PS4 consoles in the most recent quarter, bringing lifetime sales up to an impressive 116.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 won’t be as costly as Sony’s PS3 launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zWJew"&gt;It took Sony years to stop losing money on PS3 sales, but the company stopped selling the PS4 at a loss &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/23/5744344/ps4-already-profitable-for-sony-ceo-says"&gt;around six months&lt;/a&gt; after its debut in 2013. The PS5 has taken ever so slightly longer, but it’s clearly not repeating the costly exercise of the PS3 despite &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-14/sony-is-struggling-with-playstation-5-price-due-to-costly-parts"&gt;early reports suggesting&lt;/a&gt; Sony was struggling with PS5 pricing due to expensive parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NL2zj"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;revealed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it sells its Xbox consoles at a loss and doesn’t turn a profit on pure hardware alone. Microsoft has not been reporting hardware sales since early on in the Xbox One lifetime, but an Xbox executive revealed during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial that Microsoft turns a profit from game sales and online service subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH97EJ"&gt;Sony also reported (&lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/21q1_sony.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) its biggest Q1 revenue ever for PlayStation today, and its second biggest revenue for PlayStation during a non-holiday quarter. There are also 104 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, spending an average of $37.09 each during Q1 2021 across digital software, add-ons, and services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans academics who researched ad transparency and misinformation on Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anBo9hMGLo_gDDZ4xByraiZUCn4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676503/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vFppd"&gt;Facebook has banned the personal accounts of academics who researched ad transparency and the spread of misinformation on the social network. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt;Facebook says&lt;/a&gt; the group violated its term of service by scraping user data without permission. But the academics say they are being silenced for exposing problems on Facebook’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHuBqD"&gt;The researchers were part of &lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt;NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a project created to examine the origin and spread of political ads on Facebook. As the group explained in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/the-political-ads-facebook-wont-show-you-e0d6181bca25"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in May, their aim is to uncover who pays for political ads and how they are being targeted. Such work has important implications for understanding the spread of disinformation on Facebook, as the company does not fact-check political ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6vrkY"&gt;To help their work, the researchers created a browser plug-in called &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;Ad Observer&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically collects data on what political ads users are being shown and why those ads are being targeted to them. As per its &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the plug-in does not collect any personally-identifying information, including users’ name, Facebook ID number, or friend list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0A0443"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NYU’s research offered new insights into Facebook’s problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIGFbo"&gt;Data collected by Ad Observer is then made publicly available to researchers and journalists who use the information to reveal trends and problems on Facebook’s platform. Stories directly resulting from this work include Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;failure to disclose who pays for some political ads&lt;/a&gt;, and how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313013/far-right-news-misinformation-facebook-us-2020-election-nyu-study-engagement"&gt;far-right misinformation is more engaging than misinformation from center or left sources.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkH3Ln"&gt;Facebook offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of this information voluntarily through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library"&gt;Ad Library&lt;/a&gt;, but not all. For example, it doesn’t share data about how ads are targeted based on users’ interests. People can find this for themselves by clicking on ads they’re shown, and it’s this data that was collected by the NYU. (Facebook does provide information on ad targeting through a &lt;a href="https://fort.fb.com/researcher-datasets"&gt;special research program called FORT&lt;/a&gt;, but this is controlled and filtered by Facebook itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKKL1o"&gt;Laura Edelson, an NYU researcher involved in the project, and whose personal account was banned by Facebook, says the company wants to end independent scrutiny of its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3kJnHF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, 3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Laura Edelson (@LauraEdelson2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LauraEdelson2/status/1422736708433481730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GitcL"&gt;“Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform,” Edelson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/facebook-disables-accounts-tied-to-nyu-research-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an emailed statement. “Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKhz22"&gt;Facebook says it banned the researchers because they violated the social network’s terms of service, and that the Ad Observer plug-in “collected data about Facebook users who did not install or consent to the collection.” Facebook’s wording suggests the researchers were collecting data about private individuals without consent but, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-facebook-researchers-scraping"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; in March&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is actually referring to “advertisers’ accounts, including the names and profile pictures of public Pages that run political ads and the contents of those ads.” (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Facebook to confirm this but the company declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKC9X"&gt;Facebook certainly has good reason to be wary of third-parties collecting data from its site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; was only made possible because the company did not exercise proper oversight over how information could be scraped from its platform. It resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;$5 billion fine for the company&lt;/a&gt; and new privacy checks by the FTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOWLL6"&gt;Facebook now says it’s required to ban the NYC researchers under these FTC guidelines, as well as disabling their associated Pages and platform access. However, some privacy experts disagree with this. Jonathan Mayer, a professor at Princeton University who researches technology and law, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/1422733522016641028"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “Facebook’s legal argument is bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a8WQd"&gt;Facebook says it repeatedly offered to work with the NYU researchers by providing the data they need directly, and first warned the group they &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/24/tech/facebook-nyu-political-ad-data/index.html"&gt;might be banned from the site last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 worked fine with the slowest compatible SSD we could find</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YwHqYsnb0TPi6LXwXx2bvXuK8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676444/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGpAhB"&gt;If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there’s a fix on the way. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;new beta update for the PS5&lt;/a&gt; allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22366087"&gt;a PS5 SSD buying guide right here&lt;/a&gt; that meets all of Sony’s recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJUnow"&gt;That’s why we tracked down an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XPG-S50-Lite-Internal-AGAMMIXS50L-1T-C/dp/B08HVZWGPP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite&lt;/a&gt;, one of the slowest compatible PCIe Gen4 drives we could find at 3,900MB/s reads and 3,200MB/s writes, and stuck it into a PS5, along with another drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The PS5 reads 3898.001 megabytes per second in its speed test" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_5tGJnWAryRays4zRc7ziYw5go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759876/IMG_1307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yep, that’s a 3900MB/s drive all right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v7uWpg"&gt;We compared the S50 Lite against both the PS5’s internal SSD and a 5,000MB/s Sabrent Rocket 500GB in a battery of tests, including load times for games like early PS5 showcases &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&lt;/em&gt; We also measured how long it takes to back up games to each kind of drive, throwing in a Seagate external HDD for comparison, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;Sony now allows you to archive PS5 games and play PS4 games&lt;/a&gt; from an traditional hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE5QEx"&gt;The verdict? Surprisingly, even the slowest compatible SSD we could find had near-identical load times to the one Sony includes in the box. Sometimes it’s a second slower, sometimes a second or two faster, but basically it’s a total wash. Hopping through dimensions in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, I saw no appreciable difference with the slowest SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qHZe23"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10684101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea66Q"&gt;I also didn’t necessarily see a huge difference between the drives when it comes to transferring games back and forth, but there was one big surprise: at least in this beta, it appears that Sony may be throttling the write speed of the PS5’s own internal drive. It took only 2:26 to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;both PS5 and PS4 copies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; to the Sabrent SSD, for instance, but 12:47 to go back to the PS5 — over five times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59Q8qI"&gt;On average, I saw write speeds of around 1,100MB/s transferring my five test games to either of my add-in M.2 drives, but just around 220MB/s sending those same games back to the PS5. Both of those are far better than the 141MB/s average transfer speeds I saw sending games to the Seagate HDD and the 97MB/s I saw beaming them back — it took over half an hour (31:24) to transfer the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games’ 176.5GB back to the internal SSD. But the slower internal SSD write speeds are weird, and Sony didn’t have a comment when I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSk2nn"&gt;For now, the bigger question is this: will game developers fully optimize their games for the incredible speeds an SSD can afford? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D718aM"&gt;For instance, take a look at our load times for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; in the chart above. Regardless of drive, the PS4 version takes over four times longer to load! It’s the difference between waiting through a loading screen filled with gameplay tips to keep you occupied, and — at 10 seconds flat from the time you leave the PS5’s home screen to the time you can move Cloud Strife in your save game — barely seeing a loading screen at all. The latter is incredible to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YlIBe4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WZ3pTe61O4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOH5dC"&gt;Also, see those &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales &lt;/em&gt;numbers? The game doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; load as quickly as it could. Sometimes, you’ll boot up the game to see Marvel, Insomniac, and PlayStation Studios intros that eat up a whole 26 seconds, making the game take more like 43 seconds to load in total. But other times, it’ll mysteriously bypass those, loading in more like 17 seconds, and I couldn’t figure out why. I’d love to have a toggle to turn off those intros, and here’s hoping more PS5 games skip them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4F4sa4"&gt;Would I run out and buy the slowest PCIe Gen4 SSD I can buy for my PS5? I’m not so sure, because Sony picked its recommended SSD spec for a reason — even if today’s games and today’s PS5 aren’t taking full advantage, developers may need that additional headroom in the future. They’ve been promised 5,500MB/s to deliver instant game worlds, and I’d hate to find out I bought the wrong drive years down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5sHxD"&gt;Plus, there might already be some moments in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;where you’ll notice a difference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371"&gt;says Insomniac technical director Mike Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXpgVe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried some below-spec Gen4 M.2 drives as well and saw up to 15% slower loading in the most SSD-stressing areas of the game. Not too shabby, but keep a close eye on technical specs if you’re making an SSD purchase, as our game does rely on high-quality storage.  &lt;/p&gt;— Mike Fitzgerald (@fitzymj) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj3Wyt"&gt;Then again, Microsoft also uses an SSD in its Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"&gt;but one with sustained raw performance at 2.4GB/s&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the PS5’s listed 5.5GB/s read speeds. So even if developers do take advantage, it’s possible many next-gen games never see the full benefit if they’re targeting both Xbox and PlayStation instead of PS5 specifically. You’ll likely see the most benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;Sony’s exclusive PlayStation Studios titles,&lt;/a&gt; though Square Enix’s speedy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; load times gives me hope for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm1LS1"&gt;Either way, for a list of SSDs that actually meet Sony’s requirements and recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-m2-ssd-options-buying-guide-which-drives-compatible-playstation-5"&gt;here’s our buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmGd7q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, August 4th 7:25AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated to note Xbox Series X sustained SSD performance data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
