    <title>The lightest folding electric bike is a costly rideable that almost does it all</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Hummingbird’s second-generation electric bike gets a lot right&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6kdB23"&gt;“The world’s lightest folding electric bike” is a claim that ostensibly ticks all the boxes for a rideable. A foldable design that makes it easy to store and carry on public transport? Check. An electric motor to take the effort out of hills? Check. A light 22.7-pound (10.3kg) construction that makes it easier to carry in and out of train stations and into your walk-up apartment? Check. The Hummingbird Folding Electric Bike Gen 2.0 has a lot going for it on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrcCp4"&gt;It’s an enviable spec list for anyone who, hypothetically, may have recently moved to a building on top of a hill, 20 minutes away from their nearest station. But they’re also specs that anyone looking for a folding bike to help with a public transit-based commute could benefit from. On a crowded train commute, no one wants to be lugging around any more weight than absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHyaSB"&gt;Hummingbird is one of three major producers of folding electric bikes based in the UK alongside Brompton and Gocycle. At £4,495 (around $6,224.50 / €5,303.36), its new e-bike is expensive, even by the standards of these high-spec folding electric bikes (Gocycle’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357905/gocycle-g4-g4i-g4i-plus-prices-folding-e-bikes-specs"&gt;recently announced range of G4 bikes&lt;/a&gt; starts at $3,999, for example, while &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/bikes/brompton-electric"&gt;Brompton’s starts at $3,550&lt;/a&gt;). But it’s a bike that comes so close to having it all that, for the right person, this could easily be a price worth paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hTRkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10697893"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDWCIV"&gt;The Hummingbird Folding Electric Bike Gen 2.0 (which for the sake of brevity I’ll be referring to as the Hummingbird Electric 2.0) has a similar profile to Brompton’s classic folding bikes. Yes, its frame is significantly thicker, but the combination of small, 16-inch wheels with an elongated seat post and handlebar stem means that its profile feels instantly familiar. But Hummingbird has done a better job to minimize and hide as many cables as possible. The bike’s rear motor is entirely self-contained, meaning it also houses the battery and sensors, with no need for additional cables. As such there are just two brake cables running down from the handlebars, one of which is routed internally through the frame to reach the back wheel. There’s no ugly battery pack hanging off the handlebars either. It’s a slick design, all in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EVEfQ"&gt;So too are there similarities with Brompton’s folding mechanism here. Opening one latch is enough to let the bike’s back wheel swing and fold up underneath the bike’s frame, and a second folds down the handlebars. A small plastic ridge on the end of the handlebar locks under the rear wheel mechanism to hold it in place. The seat post’s standard height adjust latch can then be used to hide its length within the frame, and the pedals are also removable if you need the extra space (I never did). Folding the bike is a painless process that you can do in under a minute with a little practice, although I found it a little more fiddly to unfold it because of how tightly the handlebars lock onto the rear wheel’s folding mechanism. Hummingbird tells me this is a problem specific to my demo bike, and that it should be less tight on production models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjCK3v_8FnqB7QEhUxi64rDa6S0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761811/jporter_210803_4693_005.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bike’s folding process is relatively simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbsiuF"&gt;It’s an easy process, but Hummingbird’s bike doesn’t fold nearly as compactly as a Brompton. While folded, the Hummingbird Electric 2.0 measures 46 x 23 x 8 inches (117 x 60 x 20cm), compared to 23 x 22.2 x 10.6 inches (58.5 x 56.5 x 27cm) for a Brompton or 34.6 x 24.2 x 14.6 inches (83 x 61.5 x 37cm) for Gocycle’s G4. It’s small enough to fit on a moderately crowded train, but you’ll have an easier time if you stow it in an area designed for luggage. At least you don’t have to put up with the restrictions or costs associated with trying to take a full-size bike on the train — in London, for example, there are significant restrictions placed on when you can take non-folding bikes on trains and the Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtHSTf"&gt;What Hummingbird’s electric bike lacks in space efficiency it arguably more than makes up for in portability. Its 22.7 pounds (10.3kg) is lighter than my personal (admittedly budget) full-size aluminum road bike, which is neither electric nor folding. For comparison, Gocycle’s G4 weighs 36.6lbs (16.6kg) and Brompton’s electric bike weighs upward of 36.5Ibs (16.6kg) including its battery. I had little trouble carrying Hummingbird’s bike around the London Underground on an evening when I was too inebriated to ride it home. My only complaint is that I wish it had an option to be wheeled around while folded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0P5AS"&gt;Given the focus on weight, the e-bike is pretty bare-bones as standard. There are no built-in lights, fenders, kickstand (though you can half-fold the bike to make it freestanding), bell, or a rear rack, though most can be added as optional accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3qhN34mGw_2hzlY5_QuJVtj0qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761579/jporter_210803_4693_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hummingbird’s Zehus-manufactured hub motor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rflXwocB0kruUdmQvFk3GPFj1zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761585/jporter_210803_4693_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small wireless remote can be used to control the motor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5tJi9"&gt;The Hummingbird Electric 2.0’s electric elements are almost entirely housed within a new Zehus-manufactured rear hub motor. This motor is the only significant difference between this and Hummingbird’s first electric bike, and it offers more torque and range than the previous motor. You plug the bike’s charger into this motor directly to refill the battery, but it’s not easily removable if you want to charge it separately from the rest of the bike (which is an option for other brands like Gocycle and Brompton). Outside of this motor, the only other sign that this is an electric bike is the small, battery-powered remote attached to the handlebars, which is a far cry from the digital or LED displays found on many other e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VZS5A"&gt;There’s no physical button on the motor to turn the bike on, which makes starting your ride a little more complicated than some other e-bikes. But once you’ve activated the motor, it stays on for the duration of the ride. There are three options to turn it on. The simplest, and the one I ended up using for most rides, is to get up to a speed of 10km/h (around 6mph) and then backpedal three full rotations to kick the motor into life. It’s not ideal if, for example, you start your ride at the bottom of a hill which makes getting up to 10km/h on this single-speed bike a challenge, but it’s reliable without much room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y1McL4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are three ways to activate the bike’s motor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzfOa"&gt;The second method is to use the wireless remote attached to the handlebars. This process can be a little finicky, but it’s straightforward once you know what you’re doing. The easiest way is to lift the bike off the ground and start its back wheel spinning with a quick push on its pedal. This wakes up the motor, after which you can press the remote’s central button to establish a connection, and then press it &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; to start up the motor. It can feel unresponsive at first, but once you understand you need to wait for the remote to connect, it’s fairly painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4U41M"&gt;Finally, you can engage the motor by using Zehus’ companion app. Like with the remote, you’ll have to start the wheel rotating in order to wake the motor from sleep and ensure the app can discover and connect to it via Bluetooth, but once you’ve done so you can engage the motor in a couple of quick taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rD6c9n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an app, but you don’t have to use it for every ride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lx74T2"&gt;I broadly don’t like having to use companion apps when it’s not strictly necessary, and thankfully the Zehus app is mostly optional. Yes, the app is used for registering the bike, and yes you’ll need it if you want to tweak the motor’s custom power setting, but you can get away without using this functionality for most day-to-day riding. I found it more convenient to use the bike’s handlebar remote to switch between power output modes, rather than using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddMye"&gt;The one app-exclusive feature I could see being useful on a regular basis is a locking function, which applies resistance to the back wheel, making it hard to rotate. Given how light and easy-to-carry the bike is, Hummingbird doesn’t recommend relying on it to prevent a theft on its own. But it’s a nice extra bit of deterrence when paired with a more traditional lock (or two) that makes the e-bike unrideable if stolen. The Hummingbird’s thick frame means that finding a place to affix a D-lock is a bit of a challenge, so in the end I preferred to put a lock through the rear wheel’s frame whenever I needed to head into a shop for ten minutes or so. Given the bike’s $6,000 plus value, however, I’d be careful about locking it up outside for any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8vDTm63QNo3CEtTdtmCXQ4vXKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761590/jporter_210803_4693_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant pot not included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g7MkrR"&gt;Start riding the Hummingbird Electric 2.0, and you’ll very quickly become aware of the fact that over a third of its weight (3.5kg) is concentrated in its rear hub motor. Lean back too much when you take off from a set of lights, and it’s all too easy to pop a wheelie and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH37T4ZdVj4"&gt;go full Vin Diesel&lt;/a&gt;, especially considering the bike’s relatively relaxed riding position. There was also an occasion going up a steep hill that I felt the beginnings of a wheelie coming along, so it’s definitely something you need to be aware of mid-ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hETxcD"&gt;In general, once you’re up to speed, Hummingbird’s second-generation electric bike is a real joy to ride. Despite its low center of gravity, I never had any issues with balance, nor did I find it at all twitchy to steer like I did with Brompton’s e-bike. It’s a smooth and enjoyable ride, and the amount of carbon used in its construction helps with shock absorption as much as it makes the bike incredibly lightweight. At a push, I think Gocycle’s larger wheels make for a slightly more stable ride, but Hummingbird’s design was still easy to control through London’s streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ba7i3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The motor is quiet, but far from silent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MykA47"&gt;Hummingbird’s bike was less comfortable over long rides. During an hourlong ride across London, I started to get sore at around the half-hour mark. After 45 minutes, I was choosing to stand up when stopped at traffic lights to give my poor posterior a rest. Shorter rides than this were generally fine, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv2Uia"&gt;The bike’s Zehus motor emits a quiet electrical whirring sound, even when in its least powerful eco mode. But it offers a smooth ramp of power as you cycle, with the gentle sensation of someone running behind you with their hand on your back offering an extra bit of assistance, and it’s happy to give you an extra push even from a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xrebTq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I got around 45km of range in my tests&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qBzK5G"&gt;Hummingbird says that its second-generation electric bike should get you around 35km of range when used in its Turbo mode, extending to up to 60km in Eco mode. In practice, I never stuck with just one mode over the course of a ride, and I think most other people would do the same. I found Eco tended to struggle on steep hills, so it made sense to use the bike’s remote to pop it into Turbo mode briefly until I was on level ground. In the end, this meant that I got a little less than 45km of range out of the bike in mixed usage. That was a combination of shorter rides to and from stations, as well as two longer rides between south and north London. I think that’s more than long enough for any single day of riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwJWGB"&gt;I was very thankful for the bike’s light weight when its battery did eventually run dry. I wouldn’t say that riding it up a steep hill with no assistance was a &lt;em&gt;pleasant&lt;/em&gt; experience, but it wasn’t bad enough that I had to get off and push. It felt a lot like riding a non-electric folding bike up a steep hill; unpleasant but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHHYRq"&gt;As a final note on battery life, Hummingbird says you should expect to get around two weeks of charge out of the bike’s handlebar remote. Unfortunately, it requires an old-fashioned Micro USB cable to charge it. It’s a little annoying having to charge two different elements of the bike, but at least you won’t have to charge the remote as frequently as the main motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHumvURs06-suejWqzRsA0fCxvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761588/jporter_210803_4693_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The handlebar clips under the bike’s frame to hold it together while folded. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqcpQLXXNUBaFCiRoU_M3TaLdug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761589/jporter_210803_4693_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s compact, but not as compact as some other folding bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="J4grSw"&gt;It’s hard to fault the Hummingbird Electric 2.0 by most normal measures, because clearly this is a bike that’s been designed to offer zero compromises aside from its extortionately high price. And when a bike costs over $6,000, you really do want to be aware of every tiny potential pain point before you make a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4F4fI"&gt;So yes, I would have liked for it to be possible to wheel the bike around when folded, and I’m also not a fan of having to keep both the remote and motor’s batteries charged independently. At a push, you could also argue it’d be nice to have an easily removable battery, but when you’re dealing with a folding e-bike it seems fair to assume most people will be stashing these in hallways rather than having to store them in a garage or bike stall on the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1U7iAN"&gt;But really, the only problem I have with the bike that could possibly be elevated beyond “quibble” status is its size while folded. It’s just a tad too long to be comfortable to maneuver on very packed public transit, and it’s a shame that your only option is to carry it, with no potential for wheeling it around. As lightweight as it is, it’s still taxing to carry over the long distances necessary in the London Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mdBsKP"&gt;Aside from that, though, the Hummingbird Electric Bike Gen 2.0 ticks basically every box for urban commuters. It’s light enough to carry through a multimodal commute and has enough range to ride over longer distances when you want to skip the train entirely. If you’re spending over $6,000 on a bike, it needs to be able to do it all, and Hummingbird’s bike comes so very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efnWwB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEfl89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google bans tracking tool that sold users’ location data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-wP6reSWSE7z6gaaNwURJoGhVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715842/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="25COoC"&gt;Google has banned a company that sold Android users’ location data for COVID-19 mapping and other purposes, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db4ad/google-bans-safegraph-former-saudi-intelligence"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. SafeGraph was one of several companies that collected geolocation records through plug-ins in other Android apps, then aggregated it for organizations &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-us-reopen.html"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.safegraph.com/blog/safegraph-provides-cdc-fed-and-1000-organizations-with-data-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEJLwa"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, Google told developers in June that they had to remove SafeGraph’s software development kit within seven days. &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; says it’s not clear whether SafeGraph is still collecting any data from Android apps, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Google and SafeGraph to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjKOnj"&gt;SafeGraph’s ban follows an earlier crackdown on location-collecting apps. In December 2020, Google and Apple banned a similar service called X-Mode Social, which reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x"&gt;worked with the US military&lt;/a&gt; among other customers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on its policy around SafeGraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xsDt7"&gt;SafeGraph data is supposed to be anonymized, but as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; discusses, location datasets can often reveal details about individuals despite these safeguards. And although users must approve location-gathering by individual apps, many aren’t aware of how their information is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff4BmE"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a frequent critic of location-gathering apps (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395650/wyden-paul-fourth-amendment-is-not-for-sale-act-privacy-data-brokers-clearview-ai"&gt;sponsor of a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would restrict their use by law enforcement) offered both praise and criticism of the move to ban the service. “This is the right move by Google, but they and Apple need to do more than play whack-a-mole with apps that sell Americans’ location information. These companies need a real plan to protect users’ privacy and safety from these malicious apps,” he said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola wins $2 million DOE grant after founder’s indictment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iDixNrGGE90b9o6nG1RMNCEf3is=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715640/nikola_tre2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qC5F6U"&gt;Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola has won a $2 million grant from the Department of Energy just two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;founder and former chairman Trevor Milton was indicted for allegedly committing fraud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oH6gxD"&gt;The grant is meant to help Nikola research autonomous refueling technologies for hydrogen refilling stations. It was awarded by the DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy transportation office as part of its Hydrogen and Fuel Cells R&amp;amp;D program, which is focused on proving the reliability and sustainability of using hydrogen as a zero-emissions power source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdx303"&gt;The DOE grant comes at a time when the department is getting ready to ramp up funding activity to help advance the United States’ development of clean energy technologies — a priority under President Biden. One of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-granholm-interviews-energy-loans-5ceef97a73fc04fe3cca75bf84e91327"&gt;first moves&lt;/a&gt; after she was appointed was to revive the department’s loan program, which has been largely dormant since the early Obama administration. That program made a number of bets on clean energy startups in the aftermath of the recession that blew up in the administration’s face, like solar tech company Solyndra (which went bankrupt after China dramatically drove down the cost of solar panels) and Fisker Automotive (which went bankrupt after problems with its battery supplier). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X8J5Ab"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration is likely going to get pretty active with grants and loans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxugk"&gt;The DOE loan program also helped some companies survive the tumultuous years of the early clean tech boom, like Tesla. “If you want to have the leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the world... you’ll have to make multiple bets. And some of those bets will lead to losses,” new loan program head Jigar Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-jigar-shah-plans-to-manage-does-40b-loan-programs-office"&gt;when he was tapped earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s separate from the grant programs, the DOE loan program is known to be in discussions with at least one other troubled EV startup: Lordstown Motors, which has said for months now that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/01/lmc-moves-forward-in-loan-program/"&gt;in the “due diligence” phase of a request from about $200 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzuBGC"&gt;Nikola has spent much of the last year trying to rebound from Milton’s ousting, which came after he was accused of lying about the progress the startup had made by the time it went public. Short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;report last September&lt;/a&gt; that tried to make the case that Nikola was an “intricate fraud,” including the now famous claim that the startup had staged a video showing one of its trucks operating by secretly rolling it down a hill. The report torpedoed General Motors’ decision to take an 11 percent stake in Nikola, and Milton resigned soon after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w13FDS"&gt;Nikola eventually performed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-02-26/money-stuff-startups-sometimes-stretch-the-truth"&gt;an internal investigation that confirmed Milton had lied, a lot&lt;/a&gt;, and the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into his claims. Last month, they filed parallel criminal and civil charges against Milton as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMdHb9"&gt;Nikola is still losing around $100 million per quarter, and it had around $630 million in the bank at the end of the second quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku7Lzd"&gt;“Autonomous fueling is part of the industry’s effort to ensure fast, efficient, and safe fueling of a large onboard storage system to be less than 20 minutes for heavy-duty vehicles,” the company said in a statement. “This project is expected to address this goal by working to develop an autonomous fueling system that can rapidly refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell electric trucks, while minimizing labor and challenges relating to ergonomics and maintenance of equipment, as compared to an equivalent manual fueling process.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ToneStone is a music production app from the people behind Guitar Hero and Left 4 Dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0MZuqwcV17XILHcph1w2P5vsHw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715549/ToneStone_Product_Concept_Art_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ToneStone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oqPe9i"&gt;ToneStone is an app designed to make producing music easy, even for users without any musical experience, and it’s created by people who worked on &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Even though the app is officially being announced today, it’s still in closed beta, and &lt;a href="https://tonestone.com"&gt;there’s a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to try it out. As a music production hobbyist, ToneStone’s interface and game-like features very much seem like my kind of jam, based on videos I’ve seen of the app and my conversation with founder Greg LoPiccolo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqDvjI"&gt;If you’ve never heard of LoPiccolo, you’ve probably heard of games he helped make. He worked at Harmonix, the studio that made music-based games like &lt;em&gt;Rock Band &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt;. Another ToneStone founder is Tom Leonard, who has some of Valve’s greatest hits, like &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-leonard-49386b/"&gt;listed on his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. LoPiccolo said that the mission for ToneStone is to “empower a global community to create and share music,” which he sees making songs as a “critical human need that everybody wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4OegT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone uses a system of loops and decks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8hm9d"&gt;In an attempt to make music production novice-friendly, ToneStone uses a system of loops and decks. Imagine loops as building blocks to a song — they can be used to add drums, synths, strings, etc. The loops are then organized into decks, which represent different music genres like synthwave, trap, or pop. ToneStone has premade decks built in, but you can also create your own, and even add your own sounds or recordings as loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p6VQYZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dfi5yqtMENA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0kEpt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tutorial video illustrates what the process of actually making music is like in the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giK2kS"&gt;The team behind ToneStone also hopes it’ll act as a sort of music creation social platform, by making it easy to share your music and remix songs that others have made (at the moment, most of the sharing is being done on Discord). There have been other games that let users make music, but it's difficult to navigate the line between being &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jBR5OSqxVw"&gt;too complex for beginners&lt;/a&gt; and too simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjrd8A"&gt;Remixing another ToneStone user’s song (which are currently shared in the Discord) gives you access to the entire project file, or as LoPiccolo put it, the musical DNA, which lets you really change things up from the original. You can also share any songs you made by exporting them as an MP3 file and uploading them to services like SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G0PU4Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4gazyLegSg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQuFCI"&gt;With founders who have years of experience in making games, it’s not surprising that ToneStone has gamified elements. LoPiccolo told me that the tutorials, which are meant to teach the basics of both the software and music composition, are lightly gamified. He also talked about the similarities between building a deck of loops and building a card deck in games like &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; — there are built-in decks, too, but the real fun comes when you start making your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="noczBf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone takes inspiration from games like ‘Magic: The Gathering’ and ‘Hearthstone’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKoymX"&gt;LoPiccolo told me that the team has “some, I would dare say, revolutionary ideas” that are currently in development, that would “let people make musical decisions, and write and perform music as gameplay.” While what the actual gameplay will look like is unclear, the idea is to give the player enough decisions to get them into a groove, sort of like what can happen when playing more traditional games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty. &lt;/em&gt;The difference would be that, at the end, you’d have a musical creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSDFzj"&gt;I came away from the discussion imagining a series of quick-time events where you were deciding where the song was going to go, which sounds like a really fun thing to play around with (though it’s unclear if there’s some sort of seed or another process that prevents everyone from ending up with similar-sounding songs). LoPiccolo said that the ultimate goal was to make the experience either single or multiplayer, giving you the ability to collaborate with someone else to make music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tYoJXK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone’s modability reminds me of the DIY music production world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xi2HyT"&gt;Like video games, LoPiccolo says that ToneStone will also be moddable and extendable. Its engine is written in JavaScript, and he says that users will be able to contribute not just music but interactive content like tutorials, guides, or even game modes. As someone who’s spent some time in the DIY music production world, the idea of those kinds of community contributions reminds me of the YouTube tutorials, shared project files, and VST plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ToneStone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compare this image of ToneStone’s UI from one of its tutorial videos to FL Studio’s UI, seen below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsRxs8TbPeOHUlMO7SFb9MPlC9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776459/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_10.46.43_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A project file for a relatively simple song in FL Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4oOjNq"&gt;While ToneStone seems to have a good number of advanced features, simplicity is still a priority for its creators. They say users should be able to go from opening the app to making music “within seconds” — the more advanced stuff can wait if you’re not interested or ready to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="70rHuR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users should be able to go from opening the app to making music “within seconds”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Kizs"&gt;I’ve spent hours and hours learning how to make music in apps like FL Studio and Logic Pro (mostly for fun), and hearing LoPiccolo enthuse about ToneStone makes me wish I had something like it years ago. I suspect I may end up using it for quick sketches and soundtracks that I would’ve used Logic for, just for the speed and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPh1ZE"&gt;Of course, ToneStone isn’t the first app designed to let music novices create songs. Apple’s GarageBand has a feature called Live Loops, which has a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/live-loops-overview-chsca7ff9ced/ipados"&gt;similarly user-friendly interface on iPads&lt;/a&gt;. I remember my experience using Live Loops as being fun but extremely frustrating when I tried to really make the song my own. GarageBand is also limited to Macs, iPads, and iPhones, where ToneStone runs on Macs and PCs and is distributed &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627320/ToneStone/"&gt;through Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYNbra"&gt;ToneStone’s goal is to blend the social aspects of gaming with the creator-driven content of platforms like Instagram to ultimately create music. While the social aspects of music production that ToneStone is leaning on aren’t new (especially in the indie and hobbyist music scene), it does have a point that actually making music can be daunting to beginners. When I first started, beginner tutorials &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OmX3PYE0Hw"&gt;looked like this&lt;/a&gt;, which is significantly scarier than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfi5yqtMENA"&gt;ToneStone’s own tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S3pWWX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LoPiccolo talked about game developers being able to score their own indie games with ToneStone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTxcE"&gt;ToneStone is still in its early stages, but its team has high hopes for it. LoPiccolo painted a picture of what the app can currently do, saying that it can be used to “create license-free soundtracks for indie games or live streams,” and said that the team is working on making things like live performances and collaboration possible. With the app still in closed beta, there’s not a set-in-stone business model yet, but LoPiccolo told me that the intent is to offer a base app for free, with access to advanced features unlocked by a subscription (though he didn’t share pricing information). He also said that the app will include a marketplace where you can buy new loops, effects, or modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOccJH"&gt;You can sign up to the beta waitlist on &lt;a href="https://tonestone.com/waitlist/"&gt;ToneStone’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals cast for its live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar: The Last Airbender" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOmgob6hq0vrjVXjBWd4k19_SE0=/5x0:2366x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715358/Screen_Shot_2020_07_21_at_9.38.25_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EglA0N"&gt;It’s been some time since we’ve heard news about Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;, but today the streaming company is finally revealing details: namely, the cast for some major roles. The show will feature Gordon Cormier (&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;) as Aang, Kiawentiio (&lt;em&gt;Beans&lt;/em&gt;) as Katara, Ian Ousley (&lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;) as Sokka, and Dallas Liu (&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;) as Zuko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJo8tS"&gt;The live-action adaptation was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/18/17874344/avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-series-netflix"&gt;first announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and ran into some trouble last year when &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko stepped away from the project citing creative differences with Netflix. “I realized I couldn’t control the creative direction of the series, but I could control how I responded,” &lt;a href="https://www.michaeldantedimartino.com/an-open-letter-to-avatar-the-last-airbender-fans/"&gt;DiMartino wrote in a blog post at the time&lt;/a&gt;, adding that “Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to be good... but what I can be certain about is that whatever version ends up on-screen, it will not be what Bryan and I had envisioned or intended to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvuJpvHdZjRLVuMfXq04SyL9ZyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778025/FINAL_16x9_Cast_rounded_v3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UdgLbV"&gt;Taking over as showrunner is Albert Kim (&lt;em&gt;Sleepy Hollow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nikita&lt;/em&gt;), who posted a blog today about the process of creating what will be the second live-action take on the series, following M. Night Shyamalan’s 2010 film. “The more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became,” &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bringing-avatar-into-the-live-action-realm-for-fans-old-and-new"&gt;Kim wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “VFX technology has advanced to the point where a live-action version can not only faithfully translate what had been done in animation — it can bring a rich new visual dimension to a fantastic world. We’ll be able to see bending in a real and visceral way we’ve never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPQmkI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLUbjX"&gt;He also touched on the casting specifically, noting that “a live-action version would establish a new benchmark in representation and bring in a whole new generation of fans. This was a chance to showcase Asian and Indigenous characters as living, breathing people. Not just in a cartoon, but in a world that truly exists, very similar to the one we live in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saERwN"&gt;There’s no word yet on when the new show will debut on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Microsoft is mocking its Xbox Series X name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_EoDqGlUVMI_4MqQgvfFDYzekzQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715224/xboxmeme.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvO6Rv"&gt;Microsoft has been the subject of many memes about its Xbox naming decisions in recent years. The Xbox Series X follows the Xbox One X, and the Xbox Series S is the successor to the Xbox One S, and before that there was the Xbox One. That’s led to the internet making memes about one Xbox One X box, and a series of Xbox Series X boxes. After many Xbox box memes, Microsoft has now started openly mocking its Xbox naming decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edntrg"&gt;In a video on Instagram, Microsoft has made its own Xbox box meme, which includes an Xbox Series X, an Xbox Series X box, an ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to its box, a series of ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to their boxes, and a series of ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to their boxes in the shape of an X. Dizzy yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="vThzuv"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hncK88"&gt;Now that Microsoft has adopted the meme, the official internet rules state it’s no longer cool. Microsoft has officially killed the Xbox box meme, even if it says “we’ll keep going until someone tells us to stop.” Perhaps that was Microsoft’s grand plan, as the Xbox maker also killed the Xbox fridge meme by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/3/16/21181399/microsoft-xbox-series-x-size-fridge-comparison-measurements"&gt;embracing it early on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBVRbe"&gt;In fact, the Xbox team has been using memes frequently since the Xbox Series X was announced in late 2019. Even the leak of the Xbox Series S last year prompted the Xbox Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1303213264441024514"&gt;to respond with a meme&lt;/a&gt;, before the console was officially detailed hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5VCuq"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;beat Skittles in a Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; and decided to make mini Xbox Series X fridges a reality. The mini fridges will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532185/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-available-holiday-2021"&gt;available this holiday season&lt;/a&gt;, in a case (or a box, if you like) of a meme turning into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP Elite Folio review: style over substance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good looks, but average performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nk9zJV"&gt;HP has put out what I can best describe as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Spectre Folio&lt;/a&gt; form factor. The Elite Folio is a lightweight, leather-covered, convertible Windows laptop powered by a Snapdragon processor with Arm architecture. It’s a neat-looking, futuristic system that’s meant to be used on the go, rather than for intensive tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdE0p7"&gt;I often view products like this as the ideal secondary device — something to bring to a conference, or to run Netflix on at night. But with a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Flaptops%2Felitebook-folio-356504--1%23%21%26tab%3Dvao&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22620111%2Fhp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting price of $1,629.73&lt;/a&gt;, the Elite Folio is priced like a primary work driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec43J5"&gt;Arm for Windows has certainly improved since we first reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. App compatibility is no longer the complete disaster it was then. Still, purchasing this device is compromising on performance and may be compromising on software options, depending on the apps you’re using. Some people are certainly well-suited to the Elite Folio, but if you think you’re in that group, just make sure you know what you’re getting into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjBrbi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10696535"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kWVg1t"&gt;The primary reason the Elite Folio is able to command that premium price tag is its design. The entire chassis is wrapped in leather (vegan leather, per HP, so technically polyurethane), which will make you look like you’re carrying around a fancy notebook. It’s 2.9 pounds, but it feels lighter than it is to me, maybe because the leather cover makes it so comfortable to carry. The keyboard deck is a dark onyx color (matching the leather cover) with a nice, smooth texture; it’s not a fingerprint magnet, which black computers (even at this price point) often are. An included stylus lives in a silo below the chin, which charges when it’s not in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgZO2b"&gt;But the most unique feature is the form factor. The Folio is a convertible laptop, but you have more than the usual tent, tablet, and clamshell options. You can also pull the screen over the keyboard and rest it in the middle of the deck (either above or below the touchpad), creating a sturdy easel for note-taking or drawing. (I ended up using this formation a lot when I was writing or drawing with the stylus, because the Folio’s hinge isn’t super sturdy, and there’s noticeable wobble when you touch the screen in clamshell mode.) There aren’t a ton of laptops with this sort of form factor, especially outside the creativity space. The last one I reviewed was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;Acer’s ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking 5.6-pound affair with a GPU inside. HP has used the design before, of course, with its 2019 Spectre Folio that the Elite Folio succeeds, but HP isn’t selling that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhgx2L"&gt;The Folio’s screen is smooth to move, and I was never worried about it sliding around. Pulling it over the keyboard does take a firm tug, and it’s a bit difficult to do without touching the screen in the process and potentially messing up my tabs. I think this is the first laptop I’ve ever reviewed that I wish had slightly larger bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio open on an outdoor table with a railing and the river in the background.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in clamshell mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio stylus and top bezel angled to the left, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMaqqQjxV_91Hs9VxJrOoEVBH1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774697/mchin_191104_4704_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus easily pops in and out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1bzah6oRWaR4RcJQyMxIkqPu0ZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774699/mchin_191104_4704_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard has 1.3mm of key travel and is quite clicky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in tablet mode leaning against a railing with a river in the background on a wooden table. The screen displays a lock screen with a twilight city along a river." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmQHQ1uzQJN4uoGAioWCLWQ0CXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774700/mchin_191104_4704_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in tablet mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP1t4"&gt;In addition to the form factor, the Folio’s audio makes it a decent videoconferencing machine. The four-speaker array, including upward-firing grills on either side of the keyboard, delivers clear, excellent sound with strong vocals and even audible bass — a rarity on laptops of this size. There’s one catch, which is that there was a bit of audible distortion around some high treble tones (like when Olivia Rodrigo sings the words “deja vu” in the beginning of “Deja Vu”) that I couldn’t totally eliminate without bumping the volume significantly down. I’ve asked HP about this issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hnJYU"&gt;The HD camera, on the other hand, is standard mediocre laptop fare, delivering a grainy and somewhat dark picture even in a bright office setting. It does check various useful boxes, though: it supports Windows Hello (which didn’t give me any trouble) and has a physical privacy shutter that’s pretty easy to snap back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2Hayla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10696556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G2PAZB"&gt;Inside, the Elite Folio is running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2, an Arm chip that’s common to see in lightweight Windows convertibles (including some versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/7/20759423/samsung-galaxy-book-s-laptop-hands-on-unpacked-2019"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book S&lt;/a&gt;). It supports 5G and 4G LTE (one of the main benefits of an Arm machine), with an X55 modem. Wi-Fi 6 is on board as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJ5rl1"&gt;I remember trying out the first Surface Pro X in 2019, when Windows on Arm was painfully slow. (It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison since the Surface Pro uses Microsoft’s custom Qualcomm chips, but there aren’t too many Arm-based Windows devices at this price point for comparison.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWiCz7"&gt;The Elite Folio’s performance is night and day. (And it’s running Windows 10 Pro, not Windows 10 Home.) The device boots instantly when you open it up, and Windows Hello facial recognition takes less than a tenth of a second to sign you in. And while all kinds of apps were either unavailable or unusable on the first Surface Pro X, most of what I needed worked just fine here. (Keyword being most — more on that in a second.) For those unfamiliar, Windows apps that are compiled to x86 (the architecture Intel uses) need to be run through an emulation layer to be usable on Arm devices. The Folio can currently run 32-bit apps (though your mileage may vary), but 64-bit emulation is currently only available through the Windows Insider beta testing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzr9lK"&gt;Spotify, which has been sluggish on Arm in the past, had no problems here. It even ran more smoothly than I’ve seen it do on some recent Windows laptops. I had no problem downloading and running various web-conferencing apps like Zoom, Slack, or Microsoft teams either. Some apps were available but not the best experience. Lightroom and Photoshop, for example, could both be downloaded but were stuttery as I scrolled through various functions. That would’ve been a pain if I were using those apps day in and day out. The software we usually use to calibrate screens could also be downloaded but never recognized my colorimeter once I got it up and running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5zkPE"&gt;And some programs aren’t available at all. Dropbox is a no go — you’ll have to settle for the S-Mode version in the Windows store, a bare-bones app that doesn’t allow you to save files to Dropbox directly. You can download Steam, but a bunch of games aren’t there. I got &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; but couldn’t get &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;. But the main disappointment for me was the slim Adobe offerings. I could only access Photoshop, Lightroom, and Acrobat DC from the Creative Cloud desktop app; no Premiere Pro, no Audition, no InDesign, no Illustrator, etc. Plenty of people don’t need those apps, of course, but it’s still a shame since the Folio’s form factor could make it an appealing device for editing on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5slKf"&gt;There’s no way I could test every possible app on this device, so the takeaway here is: do some research and make sure that the programs you use are available. Call the companies if you have to. I’d really hate for someone to spend $1,700 on this product only to find out that an app they need won’t work on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in easel mode seen from the left side on a wooden table. In the background are a railing, a river, and a cityscape across the river." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jemdd2FV8quNKum6sjLCmNObD0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774702/mchin_191104_4704_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elite Folio doesn’t bend backward like a traditional convertible, but you can still flip the screen around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Zhj2zt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10696585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNUDsA"&gt;When it comes to general office use (mostly in Chrome, in my case), the Folio was functional but certainly a step-down from the best similarly priced Intel and AMD laptops. I used it to jump between around a dozen Chrome tabs and a couple apps, and there was just a bit more lag than I was used to. Text took a smidge longer to catch up with my typing in Google Docs, Slack took a smidge longer to refresh and load new conversations, scrolling through long articles was a smidge more stuttery and less smooth. The smidges weren’t the end of the world, but since I was using the Folio all day as my primary driver, they added up. My experience editing a big batch of pictures in the Windows Photos app was annoyingly slow — the program actually crashed at one point, which I’ve never seen Photos do before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFMr8Z"&gt;So what’s the benefit of an Arm chip, if not snappy performance? They allow for thinner chassis and are easy to integrate with LTE — but the primary benefit is supposed to be battery life. We’ve seen this in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412759/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price"&gt;Arm-based Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which have delivered over 10 hours in our testing, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;, which have the best battery life of any MacBooks in recent memory. So I dove into the Folio with big expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L87aEc"&gt;Unfortunately, this device’s battery life, while good, is not astonishing. Using it as my primary driver with the screen at medium brightness, I averaged eight hours and 15 minutes. To be clear, that’s not a bad result at all. But there are all kinds of Intel convertibles that perform better, last longer, and are cheaper. I easily get 10 hours with that same workload out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;, and close to nine out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. The Folio is also a case where different workloads may yield very different results, however, since emulated apps will likely consume more power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio closed on a wooden deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihJDJ5WZDej48CMIkWXs8Q-rrP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774698/mchin_191104_4704_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a neat notebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEDDQm"&gt;I’ve been looking for a portable, durable secondary device that I could use to get some work done or watch a movie or two on weekend trips. I wish the Elite Folio were half its price, because then it would be perfect for that use case, and I’d be snatching it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG3EuI"&gt;But I’m a fairly traditional business user, and Elite Folio still doesn’t have enough processing power to be my primary driver. And there are too many apps I use, including Premiere Pro, Dropbox, and a number of games, that I’d have to give up (for now, at least). That’s too big of a sacrifice to make, even for a beautiful and unique chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkmpYd"&gt;That doesn’t mean the Elite Folio is a bad laptop. It could be a great choice for people with light day-to-day tasks who are mostly working in a few tabs at a time, or who do a lot of drawing and note-taking on the move and would use the easel form. Folks who value style and presentation over other characteristics should also give it a look. It’s a gorgeous product to hold and play around with. If I got it for free, I’d bring it everywhere I went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LzVKQM"&gt;But if you’re considering buying the Folio, you should try the device yourself if you can or (and I know I’m biased here) read a bunch of reviews before you do so. Just make sure you won’t be caught off-guard by the slower performance, and that any apps you use can work as you need them to. Otherwise, you’re looking at a lot of wasted money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIV4JYlipufeD8LsgTP84cr3Dkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714896/BFARSACE_210810_4707_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XqMAWD"&gt;This week was supposed to be the first day of Google’s big reentry into flagship smartwatches. Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;back on board&lt;/a&gt; after years of Tizen-based wearables, with its new Galaxy Watch 4 that runs the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;new, revitalized Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the smartwatch OS that merges the best of Google and Samsung’s discrete platforms together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVOqm0"&gt;But there was just one issue: Google was strangely absent from the proceedings. In fact, aside from a few oblique mentions of working with Google on the software, you might have watched Samsung’s whole presentation and not even caught that the new watches were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617462/galaxy-watch-4-classic-samsung-apple-watch-google-ecosystem"&gt;running on Wear OS at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMomM2"&gt;On the one hand, this is extremely par for the course for Samsung. It’s practically a running gag at this point that Samsung goes out of its way to avoid mentioning Google or Android when it discusses its new phone releases. And indeed, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Fold 3 sections were full of praise for Samsung’s One UI, with nary a mention of Android 11 or Android 12 or any improvements Google has been making on an OS level to enable those devices to work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkVlon"&gt;Seeing a similar dynamic here with the Galaxy Watch and Wear OS 3 — one that focused more on Samsung’s One UI improvements and software layer more than anything that the new Google collaboration enables — makes sense given Samsung’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eXHvULW6AqOtYBVmhDfugp7fYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775097/BFARSACE_210810_4707_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jHmkTS"&gt;But the Samsung-heavy announcement highlights just how much of an uphill battle Google has here, and how much it’s going to have to rely on Samsung (which has very different goals than Google) as it looks to revitalize its wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnY7h7"&gt;And it’s hard to look at the Galaxy Watch 4 as anything other than a compromise of a device for Google. It’s a flagship Wear OS 3 watch that runs Samsung’s UI on top, won’t ship with Google Assistant, and comes packed with default apps that compete with Google’s own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azOrQw"&gt;The default health tracking app on Wear OS is Samsung Health. And the default payment app? Samsung Pay. The default assistant? Bixby. The list of default apps goes on: Messages, Photos, Calendar, Clock, Music and more are all Samsung’s version. You can manually install Google’s version of these apps, but it’s a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6FFGJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKR0Bj"&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS5FVh"&gt;And while Samsung is arguably a more selfish partner than Google may have hoped for to relaunch its Wear OS platform, Google also doesn’t have much of a choice. The list of Wear OS partners in 2021 isn’t long or distinguished. Motorola and LG haven’t made smartwatches in years, OnePlus, ​​RealMe, and Oppo are all using their own operating systems, and Fitbit — while now owned by Google — has yet to embrace Google’s operating system at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1TKdE"&gt;In 2021, your best bet for a Wear OS watch is either TicWatch or Fossil, which — while having done an admirable job of trying to carry the platform thus far — aren’t the kind of big name partners on the caliber of Samsung. Neither of those companies looks ready to release a Wear OS 3 watch for some time, either, with Fossil already confirming that its holiday releases will still be stuck on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521256/fossil-not-upgrade-existing-watches-wear-os-google-android"&gt;old Wear OS platform&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;With upgrades coming sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wec2Bj"&gt;There’s added confusion, too: Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, for example, will use Samsung Health for at least some of its fitness services. You can install Google Fit, but it feels like it’s tacked on this watch. And so far as we can tell, you &lt;em&gt;can’t &lt;/em&gt;switch from Samsung Pay to Google Pay or from Bixby to the Google Assistant on this watch. And the Galaxy Watch won’t work with iOS devices, something that Google won’t clarify as limited to just Samsung’s model or a potential limit of all Wear OS 3 watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6baD32"&gt;So what does Google get out of the Galaxy Watch? Well, at the end of the day, the new Wear OS-powered Galaxy Watch &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; on Google’s OS and does rely on critical Google services like the Play Store for apps. It’s more compatible with non-Samsung Android phones and will work with Google services like Maps and Gmail (even if some of those will have to face Samsung-branded competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FUINJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the end of the day, every new Galaxy Watch is also a new Wear OS user&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXbH0a"&gt;Additionally, the Wear OS smartwatch market is still pretty stagnant right now, so it’s not like Google has anything to lose by letting Samsung do a heavily Samsung-focused watch. Anyone who buys into the Galaxy Watch 4 is another user to help bolster the Play Store, and a bigger audience for developers looking to invest in Google’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vProsx"&gt;Plus, with Google’s past investments in smartwatches (a list that includes its $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187026/google-fossil-group-smartwatch-sale-40-million-wear-os-android"&gt;mysterious $40 million acquisition from Fossil&lt;/a&gt; in 2019), it’s possible the current status quo won’t last forever. If Apple and Samsung have shown anything, it’s that sometimes the best way to get a great smartwatch is to just do it yourself — and the upcoming Pixel 6 seems like it could use a matching high-end smartwatch to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dZgQ2g"&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOPGbyTORkiB8KxGywbOOR323zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777959/HONOR_Magic3_Blue_Hour.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 (left) and the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoTYks"&gt;The Magic 3 Pro and Pro Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, while the standard Magic 3 has a Snapdragon 888 processor. Around front they have a 6.76-inch 1344p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an aggressive curve around the sides of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsGfu"&gt;Rear cameras vary significantly between the three phones. On the standard Magic 3, there are three cameras: a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch main camera, a 13-megapixel 1/1.31-inch ultrawide, and a 64-megapixel monochrome camera. The Magic 3 Pro adds a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, 3.5x optical zoom, and OIS. Finally, the Pro Plus increases the size of the main 50-megapixel sensor to 1/1.28-inches, and the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 64 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EqMgk"&gt;The Magic 3 Series has a battery capacity of 4,600mAh and supports wired fast-charging up to 66W. On the Pro and Pro Plus, there’s wireless charging up to 50W with support for reverse wireless charging, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (the regular Magic 3 has an IP54 rating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnl29"&gt;The announcement of the Honor Magic 3 series follows the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;V40 in January&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 in June&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite confirming that the Honor 50 will eventually receive a global release, complete with Google’s apps and services, an exact release date is yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxYSiU"&gt;The Honor Magic 3 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for €899 (about $1,055), while the Magic 3 Pro with the same configuration of RAM and storage will cost €1,099 (about $1,290). The Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, will cost €1,499 (about $1,760). The exact date of the phones’ global release is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 65t are just $50 at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTHZAWQmgqUG-S6ZdWa3NODcdX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714831/akrales_180411_2462_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With decent sound and a stable connection, the Elite 65t were once our go-to alternative to the AirPods. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="synnAq"&gt;It seems like the market for true wireless earbuds becomes more and more crowded each week, with products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; being two of the latest contenders to jump into the already-burgeoning field. And while the Jabra Elite 65t are beginning to show their age in comparison and are by no means top of the field, they’re still a great pair of earbuds with enjoyable sound and a customizable fit, not to mention a two-year warranty that covers any potential damage they may sustain from prolonged exposure to sweat or dust. Normally $80, you can pick up the copper-black model at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-copper-black%2F6230036.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBRJYTkExnTRM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6230036&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $50&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247354/jabra-elite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review-airpods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xJtr6U"&gt;When talking TV recommendations with the rest of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff, there’s one model that seems to come up more often than any other: the LG C1. It’s not particularly surprising, however, especially since the 4K OLED is the successor to the LG CX, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs you can buy for the PS5 or Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Every configuration of the C1 offers support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies and comes with a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, and HDR. It also has a faster processor than the CX and a gamer-friendly interface that lets you quickly toggle between various settings without having to delve deep into the settings pane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaN1ct"&gt;If you don’t mind sticking with a smaller panel, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLG-C1PU-48-HDR-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-OLED-TV-2021-Model-%2F184898835257%3F_trksid%3D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals081221%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22620961%2Fjabra-elite-65t-earbuds-lg-c1-48-inch-oled-anker-nintendo-switch-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for an additional $100 off at eBay&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE20FORBTS&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing the final sale price down to just $1,197.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PZM0Kg"&gt;The Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite are great consoles when it comes to portability, but keeping either console juiced on the go can prove challenging, especially if you’re using an older Switch model that doesn’t offer the same kind of battery life as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; or forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;OLED edition&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where a device like Anker’s PowerCore 13400 Powerbank can prove handy. The compact, Nintendo-licensed battery pack — which is currently &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2rQzAA"&gt;on sale at Adorama for $30&lt;/a&gt; — provides nearly enough power to charge the standard Switch twice over and can be used with a range of other USB-C devices.&lt;/p&gt;
