    <title>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series will premiere in September 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jGKWyJHPjffOn8suX_kH48Xeug=/600x0:7080x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69668070/AmazonStudios_210802A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image from Amazon’s yet-untitled Lord of the Rings series.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Ry8Rm"&gt;One of Amazon’s most anticipated originals to date, a yet-unnamed &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; original series, will officially debut on Prime Video on Friday, September 2nd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMgRy"&gt;Along with a premiere date, Amazon Studios released an official first image from the forthcoming series, which will be set in Middle-earth’s Second Age. The series will take place thousands of years before the events chronicled in J. R. R. Tolkien’s &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; books, and it will follow characters “both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ3zjJ"&gt;The image release is tied to the series’s production wrap after filming in New Zealand. Fans &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/owk0au/on_september_2_2022_a_new_journey_begins/"&gt;quickly speculated&lt;/a&gt; that the series will be set in Valinor, as the image depicts what appear to be the Two Trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FszXoK"&gt;The untitled project is a huge investment by Amazon in its Prime Video streaming service. The series’s first season alone reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-cost-1234953345/"&gt;cost around $465 million&lt;/a&gt; to produce. For context about what a massive creative undertaking this series has been for Amazon Studios, the final season of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; was reported to have cost as much as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-television.html"&gt;$15 million per episode&lt;/a&gt; (though its budget was originally around $5 million per episode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmlSut"&gt;The headlining cast of the series includes Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Maxim Baldry, Nazanin Boniadi, Morfydd Clark, Ismael Cruz Córdova, Charles Edwards, Trystan Gravelle, Sir Lenny Henry, Ema Horvath, Markella Kavenagh, Joseph Mawle, Tyroe Muhafidin, Sophia Nomvete, Lloyd Owen, Megan Richards, Dylan Smith, Charlie Vickers, Leon Wadham, Benjamin Walker, Daniel Weyman, and Sara Zwangobani. Showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay are executive producing the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgU9YO"&gt;“As Bilbo says, ‘Now I think I am quite ready to go on another journey,’” Payne and McKay said in a joint statement. “Living and breathing Middle-earth these many months has been the adventure of a lifetime. We cannot wait for fans to have the chance to do so as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PvznX"&gt;The series will premiere in more than 240 territories and countries when it arrives on Prime Video next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HV96fsmouPZtk6sNhXcn6z5ZC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667632/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ad3o"&gt;Tech earnings this quarter were, to the surprise of no one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602434/earnings-apple-intel-nothing-earbuds-vergecast-podcast-460"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt;. But amid the record-settling revenues, the looming specter of the global semiconductor shortage was the fly in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAnOmF"&gt;While virtually none of the major tech companies sounded too concerned on their calls, component shortages were called out by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/27/amd-ceo-processor-shipments-will-grow-despite-chip-shortage-and-improve-more-in-2022/"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-warns-of-consumer-chip-shortages-for-q3"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; as potential problems for either their previous or upcoming quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p9Ww2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XeM2VH"&gt;Apple had already warned that part shortages could impact its iPad and Mac businesses at its Q2 earnings to the tune of $3 billion to $4 billion. CFO Luca Maestri &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;said on last week’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it was able to keep those losses mainly limited to iPads and under $3 billion, in what was definitely a win for Apple. But it came at the same time as a warning from CEO Tim Cook that supply constraints could impact the iPhone — the most important and lucrative part of Apple’s product lineup — in the coming quarter, which could be a far more concerning factor for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ioemva"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, too, called out a decline in Windows OEM revenue (a drop of 3 percent) as being directly caused by supply chain constraints, even as its cloud revenue continued to soar. And of course, while Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox Series X and Series S consoles continue to sell every unit Microsoft can make, there’s just simply not enough supply to go around yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AGu7VE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Earnings are up, but parts are still in short supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64lF7e"&gt;It was a similar story at Samsung, which posted increased revenue and operating profit year over year, carried by massive demand from its semiconductor business (which accounts for over a third of its revenue and more than half its profit). But Samsung was also weighed down by less overall demand and revenue for its mobile phone business, which declined compared to last quarter due to a combination of supply shortages and the seasonal buying cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig9ZtT"&gt;Other companies, like Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;have taken more drastic steps&lt;/a&gt; to face the shortage: the company had to develop new firmware for whatever chips it could get its hands on, but CEO Elon Musk was blunt about the fact that semiconductors would be a big concern for the company. “The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,” he said, highlighting difficulties Tesla experienced getting chips that power essential parts of its cars — specifically the airbags and seatbelt modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InprxV"&gt;And of course, the chipmakers themselves are calling out concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-intc-2q-earnings-report-2021-11626899296?mod=article_inline"&gt;Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger noted&lt;/a&gt; on an earnings call that the shortage could last through 2023 across the industry, noting that he expects that “it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.” The company also called out “persistent industry-wide component in substrate shortages” — meaning that Intel doesn’t expect to be able to get enough of the raw materials it needs to make chips — despite high demand for its processors. That may lead to “particularly acute” shortages for Intel’s consumer chips in the upcoming third quarter — which would be right when PC sales tend to kick up for back-to-school students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZxWS2G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow harder to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrjwvz"&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su took a more optimistic note, explaining in &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-ceo-chip-shortage-things-135346104.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while supply may still be “tight” for the rest of 2021, things have been getting better throughout the year. “As we go through the end of this year and certainly into next year, I think things will improve,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEoatK"&gt;Taken as a whole, there are two trends to see here: the first is that big tech companies aren’t letting supply issues stand in the way of posting record revenues. But it’s also clear that the impact of the shortages is very much one that’s still in progress, and until capacity starts to increase or demand starts to die down, concerns over shortages, product delays, and hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow as we head toward the busy holiday shopping season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s all finally post a fleet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXumwIQ8WNFO-QzruQrlPZ4kIJk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667141/acastro_180827_1777_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZO4ov"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter is yeeting Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its Stories-like ephemeral posts, on August 3rd, meaning that depending on when you read this, you may have mere hours to unleash that fleet you’ve been thinking about for months unto the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfTmC"&gt;And I ask — no, beg: please, post the fleets. I need some entertainment to kick off my month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3n2yFW"&gt;Look, I know that there are already a lot of different places where you can share expiring posts. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4791934/snapchats-next-big-thing-stories-that-dont-just-disappear"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en"&gt;Even LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. And that huge number of choices is probably part of why Fleets never really took off. Why share expiring posts on Twitter when many other apps have offered better tools to do so for years? Even on my iPhone 12 Mini, my Fleets bar was rarely filled up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJALgI"&gt;But let’s change that just for one day to send Fleets out in a blaze of glory. I’ve contributed to the cause, posting my final (and first ever) fleet. It’s a bad fleet, so please don’t leave me on an island — help me out by posting better fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EOoTK"&gt;Disappointingly, that annoying bar at the top of the Twitter app won’t be disappearing entirely once Fleets go to the great social media graveyard. Instead, it will show active Spaces, its social audio rooms (another feature that’s appearing in some shape or form in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;zillion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391875/reddit-talk-clubhouse-social-audio"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;including LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;). But until Spaces take over, let’s finally fill up that Fleets bar with the best (or cringiest) stuff that you’ve got. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A man violated a restraining order by renaming his estranged wife’s Napster playlists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Napster" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2V72xSJPMzPUyQHl-c7BFPExmc=/0x0:3364x2243/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667088/1083228848.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svRuxX"&gt;An Ohio man harassed his estranged wife through a shared Napster account, evading a no-contact order by changing the titles of playlists. Ohio’s Eighth District Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/8/2021/2021-Ohio-2590.pdf"&gt;outlined the case&lt;/a&gt; in a July 29th ruling, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgoldman/status/1421629682013806596"&gt;flagged on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by writer and attorney Eric Goldman. It’s an example of how metadata can become a vector for harassment outside major social platforms — echoing long-standing problems on other services like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f0fpo"&gt;According to the court ruling, defendant Jacob Dunn admitted to reaching out to his wife through a Napster account that both of them could access. A court had issued a temporary protection order (TPO) against Dunn in 2018, prohibiting him from contacting his wife through any means. But Dunn violated the order by renaming music playlists — one was changed to “I want us to work. Do you? I’ll do anything,” another to “I love you more than ever ... do you still love me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SVX3I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He’d agreed not to contact his wife through any medium&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bdJ1Mn"&gt;Dunn pled no contest to aggravated menacing and violating the order, although he later unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw and appeal his plea. At his sentencing hearing he claimed he hadn’t understood the rules of the TPO, despite explicitly agreeing to them beforehand — “I figured out the hard way, unfortunately,” he said. Court records indicate he was sentenced to probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDzsgl"&gt;Napster — a streaming service previously called Rhapsody, distinct from the defunct file-sharing service — is one of many usually innocuous services that stalkers and harassers can exploit. As &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/06/03/spotify-accused-of-letting-stalkers-hound-their-victims/?sh=4a297142253f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;contributor Barry Collins has reported&lt;/a&gt;, Spotify users have complained about being followed by stalkers who can view targets’ listening sessions and &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Your-Library/Stalker-using-Spotify-to-intimidate-and-harass-me/td-p/5030326"&gt;share playlists&lt;/a&gt; with abusive names. They’ve criticized Spotify for dragging its feet on privacy and blocking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4qC04"&gt;This case involves a more unusual problem that most anti-harassment measures wouldn’t mitigate, since it involves two people who had agreed to share an account. (It’s not clear whether they agreed to keep sharing it after separating or if Dunn’s wife simply hadn’t considered revoking his access.) It’s a clearer demonstration of how digital entanglements can have unexpected downsides — even with something as simple as a music playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter verifies fake Cormac McCarthy account (again) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHVwF2E-g6tat-cavq2WZaqoHEU=/8x0:1223x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667008/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_4.44.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cormac McCarthy at the premiere of the film adaptation of his novel&lt;/em&gt; The Road&lt;em&gt; in 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  | Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLCzSa"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is notoriously slapdash, but you’d expect the company not to fall for the exact same fake twice, right? Wrong! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr5Y8d"&gt;In 2012, Twitter verified an account supposedly belonging to illustrious author Cormac McCarthy, which was in reality started by an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/unpublished-novelists-week-fake-cormac-mccarthy/332435/"&gt;unpublished novelist&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in 2021, it’s done the same thing again, briefly verifying a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; McCarthy fake under the handle @CormacMcCrthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtL4b"&gt;The account has now been un-verified, but a representative for McCarthy’s agent at ICM Partners confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was fake. “I can confirm that this is definitely not a genuine Cormac McCarthy account,” they said. “Twitter is aware of this situation and we hope to have the issue resolved shortly.” Twitter has yet to respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO6QTs"&gt;It is certainly hard to believe that the 88-year-old McCarthy — best known for the unrelenting darkness and violence of his many novels, including &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men —&lt;/em&gt; would ever tweet anything quite as twee as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owWm-jeRHvVN3U4CF24eB3enHy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756183/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_5.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A tweet from the Cormac McCarthy account when it was verified earlier today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qPxBb"&gt;But apparently Twitter HQ was none the wiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rnBoE"&gt;The @CormacMcCrthy account has been tweeting infrequently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CormacMcCrthy/status/1052301984865214464"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; but was verified after a pair of its tweets went viral, racking up tens of thousands of likes and retweets. Many Twitter users were instantly skeptical about the authenticity of the account. “We have so normalised the idea of geniuses demeaning themselves on social media that people can actually believe Cormac McCarthy would tweet in the cadence of a John Oliver monologue,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NedBeauman/status/1421948813644865539"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; British novelist Ned Beauman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3N6P7"&gt;But the lure of Doing Numbers apparently was too much for some to stay away. Another verified author, Stephen King, had a bit of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1421859855489449989"&gt;back and forth&lt;/a&gt; with the fake McCarthy, though whether King was actually fooled by the account isn’t clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbbyx7"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is frequently criticized for being slow, unfair, or just simply wrong. It relaunched the verification process earlier this year, using the criteria that accounts should be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;” to be verified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;only to “pause” the program a week later&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have noted that the company’s checks seem so haphazard that it frequently verifies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;spam and bot accounts&lt;/a&gt;. But still, they really should have noticed that something was up here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the Pixel 6</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google’s new Tensor SoC is the heart of its next phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZtbQzN"&gt;Google is announcing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro today, though it might be &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/"&gt;better to call it a preview or a tease&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than releasing all the details on its new Android phones, Google is instead putting the focus on the new system on a chip (SoC) that will be inside the new Pixels. It’s called the Tensor SoC, named after the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) Google uses in its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBPbOE"&gt;Tensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeH2zJ"&gt;Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpRydn"&gt;Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Lm1UgR"&gt;This fall, Google will release two slightly different Pixel phones: the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. If the final versions are anything like the prototypes I saw last week, they will be the first Pixel phones that don’t feel like they’re sandbagging when it comes to build quality. “We knew we didn’t have what it took to be in the ultra high end [in the past],” Osterloh admits. “And this is the first time where we feel like we really have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWmy8w"&gt;Both versions of the Pixel were glass sandwiches with fit-and-finish that are finally in the same league as what Samsung, Huawei, and Apple have to offer. “We’ve definitively not been in the flagship tier for the past couple years, this will be different,” says Osterloh. He also admits that “it will certainly be a premium-priced product,” which I take to mean north of $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 has a hole-punch camera and thin bezels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5xkLUu"&gt;Google is only sharing a few of the key specs for each phone, leaving the details for later — likely October. (And no, there was no mention of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;folding phone&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-watch"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt;.) Google also wouldn’t allow us to take photos or video of the devices during our meeting. In any case, here is what we do know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0ruPW"&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. That screen is very slightly curved at the edges, blending into shiny, polished aluminum rails on the side. It has three cameras on the back: a new wide-angle main sensor, an ultrawide, and a 4X optical-zoom folded telephoto lens. Google isn’t sharing specs on the camera beyond saying the main wide-angle sensor takes in 150 percent more light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFYPpa"&gt;The regular Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch FHD+ screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. Its screen is perfectly flat, with matte-finished rails. It also loses the telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wl2uW"&gt;Although there will be memory differences between the phones, both will have the new Tensor SoC, a Titan M2 security chip, and in-display fingerprint sensor. There will be slightly different color options for the two types of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHB6l"&gt;As is often the case with polarizing designs, the look of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro make a little more sense in person than in leaked images. There is a huge “camera bar” that runs the full width of the phones, with a barely raised metal rail to protect the glass from scratches. There are only so many ways to handle massive camera bumps on big phones and Google’s solution is to “celebrate and highlight” them, in Osterloh’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sBcy2wSUE3dFWs1qKA34dsLrjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755094/Google_Tensor__Info_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDdD7X"&gt;If all Google were doing was rescuing the Pixel line from the doldrums of the midrange, that would be significant but not worth a months-early pre-announcement. The most important part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is that Google is using that new Tensor SoC inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nYzXVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took us a few years, but we’ve finally built a technology platform that we think is really important.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Vu8EX0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So excited to share our new custom Google Tensor chip, which has been 4 yrs in the making (  for scale)! Tensor builds off of our 2 decades of computing experience and it’s our biggest innovation in Pixel to date. Will be on Pixel 6 + Pixel 6 Pro in fall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf"&gt;https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wHiEJRHJwy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wHiEJRHJwy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1422228336533676035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hiP4hI"&gt;Qualcomm has a virtual monopoly on processors in Android devices in the US. Worldwide, there is a little bit more competition as Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei all have chips in Android phones. But on the whole, processing power on Android phones is rightfully thought of as woefully behind what Apple has done with its own in-house silicon on its A-Series line of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD9pjC"&gt;Because of that situation, there’s a lot of interest to see if Google could potentially make a more competitive chip that could differentiate its products. But don’t let that interest trick you into thinking that Tensor is exactly equivalent to Apple’s A-Series chips. Tensor is the system on a chip, with a mix of components that Google itself has designed and others that it has licensed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG72wj"&gt;Google’s not sharing who designed the CPU and GPU, nor is it sharing benchmarks on their performance — though Osterloh says that it should be “market leading.” (Current rumors suggest that it might be &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/everything-we-know-google-whitechapel-gs101-pixel-6/"&gt;Samsung providing those more standard component designs&lt;/a&gt;.) He adds, “The standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5qky4"&gt;Instead, this week’s announcement is an attempt to reframe the narrative away from gigahertz and toward artificial intelligence and machine learning in phones — areas where Google, of course, has a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbxM0h"&gt;Typically when you think about a phone’s specs, you think of the core three: CPU, GPU, and RAM. Those pieces of the SoC are what impact your day-to-day experience the most — how fast the phone feels, how long it lasts on battery, how well it connects to a cellular network, and so on. After that, there are generally some co-processors off to the side that handle discrete tasks like image processing or security. Google itself has already made some of those — the Titan M chip and Pixel Visual Core have appeared on previous phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7acPqk"&gt;“It’s definitely very different than just another co-processor,” Osterloh says. “Like with any SoC, we license a lot of technology into it, but this is our design and it was designed specifically with the purpose of driving our ML and AI forward.” Google’s argument is that the new chips in Tensor are an essential part of many of the things the new Pixel phones can do — not unlike Apple’s Neural Core in its A-Series processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqsGm"&gt;“The computers of the future are becoming much more heterogenous than they have in the past,” Osterloh argues. He has for years been signaling that the end of Moore’s law will mean that computers — and phones — will need to be built differently. “There’ll be a lot more specialized sub-elements to the design to be able to do things in specific ways. This is a consequence of raw computing power running out of headroom or growing more slowly than the kinds of processing we want to do with AI,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWIrUK"&gt;The most important of those chips is a mobile version of a Tensor Processing Unit. Google has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/19/11716818/google-alphago-hardware-asic-chip-tensor-processor-unit-machine-learning"&gt;making TPUs for its server farms for over five years now&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to more efficiently performing AI and ML tasks. It offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;an “edge” version of its TPU for enterprise solutions&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, but the Pixel 6 marks the first time Google has put a mobile TPU in a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sBRVH"&gt;So what can the new TPU inside Tensor actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? Google had a small handful of demos. The first two were, unsurprisingly, related to photography. Using ML to make better photos has historically been a huge advantage for Pixel phones, but in recent years progress has stagnated and competitors have caught and surpassed the Pixel — and far surpassed it when it comes to video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekejP9"&gt;Google clearly wants to take back the crown and thinks the TPU is the way to do it. The first demo Google showed was a blurry photo of a toddler — the kid was moving because that is what kids do. A second version of the photo was the same but run through Tensor’s TPU, and the kid’s face was sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="Umsfbk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This problem is a very difficult smartphone camera physics problem. We’re trying to turn those kinds of problems into data problems, where we can solve them with Tensor.”  &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtGJVbpSxRQ-1mZX2Td8DvmiXtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755093/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vTVVJxkcFa-nfkz1Kyx9ZPf-pOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755110/Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VMfZs2"&gt;It wasn’t a deepfake. What the Pixel 6 does is run the process of snapping a bunch of photos from the main sensor and combine them into a single, HDR image. But now the Pixel 6 also has the ultrawide grab a fast, sharper image to capture that detail. Then the TPU recognizes that there’s a face, and then combines the ultrawide’s image with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mSnOL"&gt;But impressive image demos are a dime a dozen these days. Google itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;famously promised&lt;/a&gt; to remove chain link fences from photos in 2017 but never delivered. The promise of Tensor is to deliver better results more quickly, since the SoC is designed to more efficiently run data through the TPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqimK"&gt;It’s right to be skeptical until we get a chance to test the camera ourselves. It’s &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to be skeptical of the Pixel 6’s video abilities given the Pixel line’s history of mediocre video — but Google’s second demo didn’t make skepticism easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlccE"&gt;It was a simple pan across a beach, with the setting sun fully in frame for much of the shot. As an HDR video, it was challenging. Google set up a rig with the Pixel 6, Pixel 5, and iPhone 12 Pro Max and shot the same pan with all three. As you might expect in a demo provided by Google, video from Google’s new phone looked the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5X1s6"&gt;Specifically, it didn’t artificially brighten shadows too much like the iPhone 12 Pro Max and also maintained a more natural white balance throughout. Compared to the Pixel 5, it was no contest. Last year’s Pixel over-sharpened everything into abstract art while the Pixel 6 looked much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZDoGR"&gt;The main reason the Pixel 6’s video was better, according to Osterloh, is that putting the TPU in line with the whole image processing stand means that the same HDRNet process that Google applies to still images can now be applied to every single frame in video. The demo I saw was in 4K at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWNvSE"&gt;The other demos were a bit more subtle and were related to translating speech to text, which Tensor handled locally without needing an internet connection. In one, the Pixel’s on-device auto-caption feature appeared to be a little faster and more accurate — and was even able to translate from French to English in real time from a playing video. “We’re now able to run data-center quality models on our device,” says Osterloh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fqNSB"&gt;In another demo, Osterloh showed that speaking to type was nearly instantaneous and that he could use the keyboard to edit words inline at the same time he was speaking — both input methods were active at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cCzEr"&gt;In addition to the TPU, the Pixel 6 will also have a new version of Google’s Titan M security chip. In the blog post announcing the Pixel 6, Google is going so far as to say that “with Tensor’s new security core and Titan M2, Pixel 6 will have the most layers of hardware security in any phone,” with a footnote that the claim is “based on a count of independent hardware security subsystems and components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vujKKs"&gt;Finally, Osterloh says there will be an “always-on computer” that will handle low-level, low-power processes like the ambient display. The battery life target for the Pixel 6 is still only “all day,” however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lEcuap0y9W88cjxHw_0a_-k5V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755100/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDq0Xi"&gt;The thing about AI and ML is that it might make search more accurate and photos better, but it’s not necessarily going to improve everything that happens on your phone. Osterloh suggests that as the TPU takes up more AI cycles, that could free up the other chips for more performance. That may be, but it’s still hard to make AI a selling point for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48JZZ9"&gt;So Google has its work cut out for it. Doubly so, actually, since the Google Pixel line has languished in the low single digits of market share in the US ever since it was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6HZlJ"&gt;With the Google Pixel 6, Osterloh says that’s going to change. He’s ready to start grabbing market share wherever he can get it — whether that be from Apple or Samsung. “The product is really, now, The Google Phone,” Osterloh says. “So we are ready to invest a lot in marketing and we want to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAkOHu"&gt;In last week’s earnings call, Google CFO Ruth Porat warned investors to keep a look out for higher than usual marketing costs: “In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year in part to support product launches in the holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgOcWh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the first time Google has truly pulled out all the stops for a Pixel phone, but will that be enough?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqhROr"&gt;It has been five years since Google started making Pixel phones and in nearly every single one of those years I’ve asked some variation of the same question: is Google really serious about hardware? Does it intend to be a real competitor and make real money or is the entire effort just a rehashing of the old Nexus strategy? Or, to use a more recent reference, is the Pixel line just in a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;Pantry Mode&lt;/a&gt;,” kept alive just in case it’s ever needed for real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo0jKv"&gt;Osterloh says that work on this new Tensor silicon began four years ago. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was about four years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;Google announced it intended to buy HTC’s phone hardware division&lt;/a&gt;. That must have been the year Google got serious about the Pixel line — and it’s only now that we’re beginning to see the fruits of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1I6ga"&gt;Will it be enough? Will the Pixel 6 seriously vie for the enthusiast crowd that wants the very best phone and also grab measurable market share at the same time? We are very far from being able to answer those questions right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sv73Ck"&gt;I am not going to tell you to get hyped up for the Pixel 6. It’s too early and there’s too much we don’t know. But I do think it’s very interesting that &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; wants to start building up hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmhrjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsuCuO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate negotiators release bipartisan infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Lawmakers Narrow Infrastructure Gaps Without Reaching Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bc9ApbSa5l1C2Qd13dJ1lEW_R-U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666829/1234273799.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQZv2E"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of senators released their over $1 trillion infrastructure package after weeks of negotiations. As written, the bill authorizes over $500 billion in new spending to strengthen roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like high-speed broadband and electric vehicle adoption. The result is the largest domestic spending bill in more than 10 years, touching on nearly every aspect of the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhmCC7"&gt;Last week, negotiators reached a deal to bolster the nation’s broadband networks with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;an additional $65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, but left it unclear exactly how that funding would be spent or how much of it would go toward increasing affordability and adoption.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But the text released yesterday contained language to make the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit program permanent, renaming it the Affordably Connectivity Fund. The permanent version of the program would offer lower monthly subsidies — $30 rather than the previous $50 — but would also provide $100 for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RIui6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjTsCq"&gt;More than 4 million households have enrolled in the Emergency Broadband Benefit program since it was established during the pandemic, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYiGjd"&gt;The bipartisan package also includes billions to build half a million electric vehicle (EV) chargers across the country, in an effort to increase EV sales in the US. The bill would also expand government involvement in cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes"&gt;raising $28 billion&lt;/a&gt; from a new tax on cryptocurrency brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AzMQ3"&gt;It’s unclear when the bill is expected to receive a vote on the Senate floor, but Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that it could be approved later this week. “Given how bipartisan the bill is and how much work has already been put in to get the details right, I believe the Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days,” Schumer said on Sunday. The text of the bill could still change as a result of amendments accepted on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYUDX0"&gt;Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has pledged not to bring the bipartisan package to the floor until the Senate votes on a second $3.5 trillion spending package through the reconciliation process, likely to proceed on party lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5KZQg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwO07G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft director with intelligence background will lead the White House’s space council</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The Satellite 2020 Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AnnUn4M2YsvNAe9z6r6UNUfLZ6c=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666716/1206287582.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HO4RGG"&gt;The White House’s core space policy body will be led by Chirag Parikh, a veteran intelligence official and senior director for Microsoft’s space-based cloud services, Vice President Kamala Harris announced on Monday. Harris, chair of the National Space Council, tapped the seasoned national security official to lead the council’s day-to-day activities as the Biden administration sees global competition mount in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04U2D2"&gt;Parikh’s appointment, coming three months after the White House confirmed Harris would chair its space council, gets the ball rolling for the Biden administration’s coordinated priorities in space. Harris aims to put “her own personal stamp on the council” that could include a heightened focus on cybersecurity for space assets and ways to leverage satellites in Biden’s push to fight climate change, senior administration officials said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV0l0u"&gt;In 2017, the Trump administration revived the space council, which had been disbanded since 1993, four years after it was formed by George H. W. Bush. Parikh will succeed Trump’s space council executive secretary Scott Pace, whose space policy directives sought to craft standards of international behavior in space and retooled an Obama-era space exploration program into a commercial-focused sprint to land humans on the Moon, what’s now called the Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jL3oHz"&gt;Parikh served two years as deputy national intelligence officer for science and technology for the US intelligence community, and later led the National Security Council’s space policy wing for six years under the Obama administration, when the National Space Council was defunct. Before his appointment to helm Biden’s space council operations, he was a senior director for Azure Space, Microsoft’s cloud platform that links with satellites in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CyIgYH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Congratulations to Chirag Parikh, who was appointed today as Executive Secretary of the National Space Council by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VP&lt;/a&gt; Harris! I look forward to working with you to ensure American leadership and a safe, sustainable future in space.&lt;/p&gt;— Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson/status/1422207705398272003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zNRGZ"&gt;Parikh’s appointment was welcomed by space analysts, who say his experience leading an array of space-related bureaucracies makes him a good fit for his new role. The space council bundles a number of cabinet-level officials together, from NASA administrator to the director of national intelligence, for quarterly or biannual meetings to discuss civil and international space issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2neLY"&gt;“He was almost like an interagency coordinator, which is very similar to the role that he will be playing as the executive secretary of the National Space Council,” said Victoria Samson, space policy analyst and Washington director for the Secure World Foundation. “So he’ll be bringing years of expertise to do a lot of the same sort of things that he’ll be doing in his new job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyWuyU"&gt;In the two months before the Biden administration confirmed Harris would helm the space council, it wasn’t immediately clear whether the White House would even keep it after the Trump administration. The Obama administration crafted its space policy through the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council — under Parikh’s space tenure. But the vice president’s commitment to lead the council in May became one of a few rare instances where Biden’s White House aligned with Trump-era initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the sixth meeting of Trump’s National Space Council in August 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4CDJ7V"&gt;Biden has embraced NASA’s Artemis program, the Trump-branded effort to land humans on the Moon by 2024 and use its surface as a training ground for future missions to Mars. And under Biden, NASA is keeping its preference for commercially focused projects in space, like its Commercial Crew Program — which began under Obama — and core elements of the Artemis program, which was created under Pace’s space council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InIKCJ"&gt;“They certainly have different backgrounds,” space policy analyst Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation, said on Pace and Parikh’s resumes. “It might be the case that Chirag [Parikh] is a little more focused early on in the national security side of space, rather than the civil side, because that’s his background ... but the Biden admin as also expressed strong support for the Artemis program, and for Gateway, and for commercial cargo and crew, so I don’t expect that to just be ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo adds Xbox media remotes to its lineup of excellent console accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFKOJuRY-OLSRAExdvHC9Eba638=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666522/2_8BitDo_Media_Remote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remotes will ship in September.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 8BitDo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1q1FX"&gt;8BitDo has a new pair of officially licensed media remotes for the Xbox Series X, Series S, and the Xbox One, which offer a more suitable controller for streaming services or the consoles’ built-in 4K Blu-ray players. There are two versions available: a slightly larger &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2R2GRM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99 black model&lt;/a&gt; which includes a full numpad and a compact &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2SYWH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 white version&lt;/a&gt;. Both are available to preorder on Amazon today, with shipping expected September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJhXgn"&gt;We’ve generally liked 8BitDo’s controllers in the past. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons"&gt;Pro 2 controller&lt;/a&gt; gives Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller a run for its money in terms of functionality and is more affordable to boot, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243957/8bitdo-arcade-stick-review-switch-pc-price"&gt;its wireless Arcade Stick&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to play fighting games on Switch and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/12yBteD3BWGqUtwUezBafxQ8P4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755600/3_8BitDo_Media_Remote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 8BitDo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The white model is more compact, but lacks a numpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tv2kU8"&gt;Although only one of 8BitDo’s Xbox Media Remotes includes a numpad, both have basically every button you could want, including playback and navigation controls, and a mute button. Most of the Xbox controller’s face buttons are also present, including A / B / X / Y, view, menu, and a home button that can wake the paired console remotely. The buttons are back lit, which should help with using the remote in cinema-appropriate lighting, and power is provided by a pair of AAA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtULkB"&gt;8BitDo’s new accessory is &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/theres-brand-new-xbox-series-x-series-s-pdp-talon-media-remote-preorder"&gt;far from the only media remote&lt;/a&gt; available for Microsoft’s latest consoles, and any older media remotes designed for the Xbox One &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1319303597041930241"&gt;should also be cross-compatible&lt;/a&gt;. But 8BitDo’s Media Remotes are cheap, stylish, and come from a brand that knows a thing or two about console peripherals. If you’re in the market, then they’re definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>R2-D2 is officially a Tamagotchi digital pet now, two decades too late</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7tkVxTrERLKITAkXYSkjg7ALhM=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666349/r2_d2_tamagotchi_droid_buddy_blue_TALL_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8WycKn"&gt;R2-D2 — &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;’ beloved droid — is now officially a &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-r2-d2-tamagotchi"&gt;Tamagotchi toy&lt;/a&gt;, letting you take a pocket-sized, pixelated virtual pet version of the iconic astromech with you wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEo6Ak"&gt;The R2-D2 Tamagotchi comes in two colors: a white model that more accurately resembles R2’s chassis, and a more retro translucent blue version that harkens back two decades to when people actually bought Tamagotchis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAueX32iwa2RESsRYkgBfJNe5cY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755862/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_9.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VsE88d"&gt;As for the actual gameplay experience, the R2-D2 version of the digital pet appears to be virtually identical to the same Tamagotchi gameplay loop that has existed for over 20 years. Using a 24 by 30 pixelated LCD display and three physical buttons, you’ll be able to train your R2-D2 pet in 19 different skills, take care of the droid by charging and cleaning it to keep it happy, and play nine different mini-games (including Dejarik and a firefighting game). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgLshn"&gt;Technically, the new R2-D2 toy is the first &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; Tamagotchi to feature the popular droid. But all the way back in 1997, Tiger Electronics released a Giga Pet toy starring R2-D2 (along with two other licensed &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; models featuring Yoda and the Rancor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfoYAG"&gt;It’s not clear that the new R2-D2 model is any more technologically advanced or materially different than the original Giga Pet version, given that virtual pet technology appears to have advanced at an even slower pace than TI-83 calculators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekiFfj"&gt;Given that the virtual pet fad also ended sometime around the turn of the millennium, it’s also not immediately obvious &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; there is a Tamagotchi R2-D2 being released in 2021, nor why Tamagotchi and Disney felt the need to spend nearly three months teasing said product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xlq6Pr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tamagotchi is back, but does it need to be?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16430134/tamagotchi-pet-bandai-america-nostalgia"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zQwLNv"&gt;But the new Tamagotchi R2-D2 is, well, an actual Tamagotchi this time around, complete with the familiar egg-shaped case. It’ll also presumably be more affordable than the Giga Pets version, which can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FStar-Wars-Giga-Pets%2F158701%2Fbn_1892804&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F2%2F22605668%2Fr2-d2-tamagotchi-digital-pet-star-wars-release-date-preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost $35 to $50 on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hC3xhr"&gt;Tamagotchi has yet to announce a price for the pocket astromech pet, but the company currently sells branded Tamagotchi toys for other franchises for around $25, so it’s likely that the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; model will land somewhere in that price range, too. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B097Z451CX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders start later today&lt;/a&gt; at 12PM ET, ahead of a November 11th release date. &lt;/p&gt;
