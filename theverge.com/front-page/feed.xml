    <title>Yes, Twitter changed its font</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/armgFPWJCUIr2t3e9zHz9UVAZj4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711696/E8hpSmxXoAMW80g.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter has changed the way the platform looks, including changing the font to its Chirp font.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SpZJF0"&gt;Twitter is rolling out its Chirp font to the Twitter app and feed, meaning that your daily scrolling might look a little different than you’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvlhwa"&gt;Twitter’s main account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1425505690634780673"&gt;posted about the change&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. I’m personally seeing the new font on the web and on the iOS app, but one colleague isn’t seeing it anywhere, so it may not have rolled out to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3rKG9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;okay confirmed it did&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1425505690634780673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XcAkyT"&gt;Twitter detailed the Chirp font as one part of a broader brand refresh unveiled in January. “Chirp strikes the balance between messy and sharp to amplify the fun and irreverence of a Tweet, but can also carry the weight of seriousness when needed,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/imperfect-by-design"&gt;Twitter said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16Zbem"&gt;At the time, Twitter used it in things like promotional materials and graphics, but it wasn’t the font you’d see in the feed or when navigating the app. Twitter’s Derrit DeRouen, the creative director for the company’s global brand, said in January that it was his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548692888416257"&gt;“personal desire”&lt;/a&gt; to make Chirp the typeface for the Twitter product in a thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306"&gt;about the new font&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, he didn’t commit to when that might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l6UZSR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Do we eventually see Chirp as the typeface for the product? It's my personal desire, and the work on legibility, density and weight has already begun. There is more refining to do, more languages to build, but the hard work will be worth the benefit of having a holistic brand. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fDJQpkNnVT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fDJQpkNnVT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Derrit DeRouen (@DerritDeRouen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548692888416257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HH2QfB"&gt;The new font also has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1354654194574135299"&gt;a fun Easter egg&lt;/a&gt;: you can tweet the Twitter logo if you type [CHIRPBIRDICON] in the tweet compose box. That’s “chirp,” “bird,” and “icon” all mashed into one word, and it has to be all caps for the icon to show up, in my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isJw5r"&gt;On the iOS app, the icon appeared in the compose box for me after typing [CHIRPBIRDICON], but on the web, it didn’t appear until I actually sent a tweet including the phrase and brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8or191"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter’s new “Chirp” font contains a ligature that turns [CHIRPBIRDICON] into the Twitter logo &lt;a href="https://t.co/TgCRi804iK"&gt;https://t.co/TgCRi804iK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SYDczXCBM5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SYDczXCBM5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 黃文津 Jane (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1354654194574135299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2djWzZ"&gt;The font isn’t the only visual change introduced on Wednesday. “We’ve updated our colors to be high contrast and a lot less blue — a change made to draw attention to the photos and videos you create and share,” Twitter said in a thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDesign/status/1425505308563099650"&gt;posted by its design account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuRKvu"&gt;The company is promising to roll out new colors sometime soon, though it’s unclear exactly what that means. People who subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;paid Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt; can already tweak the colors of the app and change the color of the app’s icon, though the service is only available for iOS in Canada and Australia right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULvN8T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we release updates for colors &amp;amp; typography! See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterDesign&lt;/a&gt; post for full details. The A11Y updates are:&lt;br&gt;- Higher color contrast of buttons, links, focus&lt;br&gt;- Easier reading with left-aligned text &amp;amp; more space between text&lt;br&gt;- Fewer distracting gray things&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think? &lt;a href="https://t.co/Umu3F1iJjb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Umu3F1iJjb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1425507503593467904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoEAQK"&gt;There’s also a change to the way the follow button looks that could prove frustrating. Now, when you already follow someone, the follow button’s background isn’t filled in, and when you aren’t following someone, it’s filled in with color. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1425520662995558400"&gt;writer Brian Merchant pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this is the opposite of the way the follow button worked before, so be careful that you don’t accidentally unfollow people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0UcPx5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;know what makes me want to spend more time on this website? accidentally unfollowing people I was sure I had already followed and then following them again, making them think I had only just now followed them&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;love it&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1425520662995558400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>A national alert test buzzed US TVs, radios,  and any phones that opted-in at 2:20PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Yk4FXbgUUFLoSQtjOtQg22plKU=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711293/E8H1PYXWYAEjY84.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Test Wireless Emergency Alert message | Image: FEMA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qs7pJM"&gt;At approximately 2:20PM ET, FEMA &lt;a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/frequently-asked-questions-2021-ipaws-national-test"&gt;conducted a test of both the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)&lt;/a&gt; covering radio, TV broadcasts, and mobile devices in the US, but you might not see it on your phone. That’s because this time around, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931750/fema-presidential-alert-test-reminder-trump-public-alert-warning-system"&gt;Presidential Alert test in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it only reached phones with a setting to receive test messages and by default, most phones are set to opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMSwdj"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) from the FCC, on Android phones, there should be a Wireless Emergency Alerts section in your settings menu with an option for “State/Local Test alerts” that you can turn on or off. The process described for iOS is more complicated, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt; explains how you can opt-in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t9IOZS"&gt;Open the Phone app and tap Keypad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pw6aU"&gt;To turn it on: Enter *5005*25371# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts enabled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc6luY"&gt;To turn it off: Enter *5005*25370# and tap the green phone icon. You’ll get an alert that says “Test alerts disabled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="yxKvUJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year's Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) test messages will only be displayed on wireless handsets where subscribers have “opted-in” to receive them. This will allow for a nationwide test without disturbing the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more about opting in here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy"&gt;https://t.co/kvGqLyBCqy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7"&gt;https://t.co/LW3UptMxK7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Weather Service (@NWS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWS/status/1424758994816667650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMQ1J"&gt;If you missed it, or if you weren’t thirsty enough to opt-in, this is the message for mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjFwlC"&gt;“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBkpA6hiBrfBBTVAjg3dIpV4EEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776608/this_is_a_test.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cYw84j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2:30PM ET):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the test occurred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password 8 on the Mac brings a big redesign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NtDvhQr91Risk3Yk6Mq3T4x1bU=/24x0:2124x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711539/HeroUnlocked.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="URwxbR"&gt;A few weeks after 1Password started rolling out the &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;Windows version of the redesigned 1Password 8&lt;/a&gt;, the company is now &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-mac-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;showing off the Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of the update, which is also available today to try in early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X65Io"&gt;Like the Windows version, 1Password 8 on the Mac features an overhauled design, which aims to make it clearer when items are being shared, who they’re shared with, and better labeling of groups in the sidebar.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-MUEbWlGs5qVyTPSyopWZhNDsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776517/WatchtowerDashboard.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PQjfm6"&gt;There’s also a new search bar, which shows suggestions as you search (similar to Apple’s Spotlight or Alfred), and an updated version of Watchtower, which shows a comprehensive overview of your overall password security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5jp1U"&gt;Lastly, the new app overhauls the editing window, which the company says includes a “new password generator, smart suggestions, and simpler file attachments.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agKgppnnD6WRmE7ghTm4WTwjpfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776518/opm8ea_unlocked.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Uehl"&gt;1Password 8 looks like a fairly sizable update, and users will have to opt in to the early access build to try it out today. &lt;a href="https://1password.community/discussion/122136/"&gt;Instructions are here&lt;/a&gt;, but doing so requires deleting the old 1Password 7 app and then installing the new version. Additionally, while the flashy new features and design look fun, the company cautions that 1Password 8 is “for testing and validation purposes only and is not suitable for business critical environments.” So you might not necessarily want to use it for anything super important just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIDt42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrwfK9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators target Apple’s App Store exclusivity in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InVLqrBh-kXo9CAONa4Uq094tG4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711309/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPgcBF"&gt;There’s a new bill introduced in the Senate Wednesday targeting the power dominant tech firms like Apple and Google have over the app store market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXF6EJ"&gt;The bipartisan “&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;,” introduced by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) would ban app stores from forcing developers to use the store’s payment systems. It would also bar companies from punishing developers that offer lower prices on a separate app store or through their own payment systems, along the lines of Apple’s public dispute with Epic Games. Notably, the bill would also make it unlawful for companies like Apple to use non-public data from their stores to build competing products against companies using their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mXlLqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNBQst"&gt;“For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark—pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multi-billion dollar market,” Blumenthal said in a statement Wednesday. “This bipartisan bill will help break these tech giants’ ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give mobile users more control over their own devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0PBEX"&gt;Earlier this year, the Senate Judiciary Committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;hauled in representatives&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple and Google’s app store policies and fees harm their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4O8gs"&gt;Specifically, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to make its own competing item-tracking device, the company made it more difficult for Tile products to work on the devices. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine also said that app store fees are the company’s single largest expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbX1Ud"&gt;“We have worked toward creating a fairer and more competitive app marketplace for both developers and consumers,” said The Coalition for App Fairness, which counts Epic Games as a member, in a statement Wednesday. “The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXe3CQ"&gt;Still, tech-backed think tanks like Chamber for Progress argue that the bill could pose a safety risk for consumers. “This bill is a finger in the eye of anyone who bought an iPhone or Android because the phones and their app stores are safe, reliable, and easy to use,” Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said Wednesday. “I don’t see any consumers marching in Washington demanding that Congress make their smartphones dumber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDz23s"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; challenged the app store model with lawsuits Apple and Google, asking for a court-ordered injunction that would have similar effects to the proposed bill. A federal judge is currently reviewing the Apple case to determine whether the company violated antitrust law by implementing these policies. Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;40 state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; have also sued Google over its app store model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLgcC2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa7AaM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kgO9ag"&gt;As expected, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;took the wraps off the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; and the aptly titled Galaxy Watch 4 Classic during its Galaxy Unpacked event this morning, confirming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;recent leaks&lt;/a&gt; and introducing the first two devices built on Google and Samsung’s co-developed smartwatch platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. Both watches also sport Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617873/samsung-exynos-w920-chip-announced-galaxy-watch-4"&gt;Exynos W920 processor&lt;/a&gt;, 1.5GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and come with a host of health-related features thanks to the inclusion of Samsung’s 3-in-1 BioActive sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjg00g"&gt;Although neither model is set to arrive until August 27th, both are available for preorder starting today at varying price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5191Hw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 inject Samsung’s capable hardware with Google software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qL41u7"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TBKYyG"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 is essentially the next iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt;. The aluminum smartwatch will be available in either a 40mm or 44mm configuration and will showcase two side buttons in addition to a digital bezel. It will also launch in a handful of colors — specifically black, green, silver, and pink — with additional personalization coming in the form of watch bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRp0FY"&gt;If you’re looking to secure Samsung’s forthcoming wearable ahead of launch, both sizes are currently available for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748797745164269423#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing starts at $249 (or $299 with LTE) for the 40mm model, and if you preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 between now and August 26th, Samsung will throw in a $50 credit to be used toward Samsung select devices, add-ons, and accessories. The larger, 44mm variant costs $279.99 with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, while the LTE version is $329.99. If you trade in an eligible device like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, you can also save up to $185 on the total cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2czFV3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696448"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="crVYG9"&gt;If you prefer to go through your carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14460649?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon is offering&lt;/a&gt; the Galaxy Watch 4 as low as $12.49 a month. You can also save up to $100 off if you trade in an eligible device, or $150 if you purchase the forthcoming smartwatch alongside an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b48CH2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696557"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzPZ0h"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm%3Fsku%3D887276550282&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; for the same price as Verizon. You can preorder the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm%3Fsku%3D887276550282&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm model&lt;/a&gt; outright starting at $299.99, or finance it for $12.50 a month. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-44mm%3Fsku%3D887276550213&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm configuration&lt;/a&gt; will cost you $329, or $13.75 a month, if you prefer to pay in installments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5VVA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cezWss"&gt;Lastly, AT&amp;amp;T is offering preorders on both the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-40mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-44mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm models&lt;/a&gt;. You can preorder the 40mm configuration for $299.99, or the 44mm model for $329.99, and AT&amp;amp;T will knock up to $200 off if you trade in an eligible device. Financing is also available for $8.34 and $9.17 a month, respectively, and you can get a second Galaxy Watch 4 when you purchase both on a qualifying installment plan and add a new data line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9yX5Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nk3xZL"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh5xXl"&gt;Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, the Classic represents a more traditional take on a smartwatch, albeit with Wear OS 3 inside. The compact watch will launch with a stainless steel build and the same AMOLED display as the Galaxy Watch 4, however, it also features a bezel you have to physically rotate. It will be available in 42mm and 46mm versions and in one of two colors (black or silver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjCSp9"&gt;On the preorder front, both sizes of the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic are now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748797745164269423#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available from Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing starts at $349.99 (or $399.99 with LTE), and Samsung will throw in a $50 credit if you preorder the watch prior to its launch on August 27th, which you can use on select Samsung devices and accessories. The bigger, 46mm model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi retails for $379.99, while the LTE-equipped variant runs $429.99. Like with the Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung will also take up to $185 off the total cost with an eligible trade-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNzG3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSVNnX"&gt;If you’d like to preorder the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic via your carrier, you have a few different options. The 42mm Galaxy Watch 4 is currently &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Verizon&lt;/a&gt; outright for $399, or for $16.66 a month. The 46mm model, on the other hand, will cost you $429 outright or $17.91 a month on an installment plan. AT&amp;amp;T will also give you a $100 credit if you trade in an eligible device, or it’ll take $150 off if you purchase the smartwatch with an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gDo3yN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696718"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIhfhc"&gt;T-Mobile offers the same pricing as Verizon, though you can also get a second Galaxy Watch 4 Classic of equal or lesser value for free if you opt for an additional line and purchase both devices on an installment plan. As for pricing, you can preorder the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-42mm%3Fsku%3D887276550787&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;42mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-46mm%3Fsku%3D887276550909&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617607%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;46mm models&lt;/a&gt; for $399.99 and $429.99, respectively, or opt for an installment plan starting at $17.92 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JW5vCK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10696762"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvT3I3"&gt;If you’re on AT&amp;amp;T, you can preorder both the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-42mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;42mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch4-classic-46mm-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;46mm models&lt;/a&gt; for $399.99 and $429.99, respectively. You can also finance the 42mm model for $11.11 a month or the 46mm model for $11.95 a month; you can even get a second Galaxy Watch 4 Classic for free when you opt for an additional data plan and purchase both on a qualifying installment plan. Like Samsung, the carrier will also take up to $200 off with an eligible trade-in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 Beta 4 promotes order over chaos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTHQWc69ttANwwrpFsZJ8lhlhVs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710995/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pP18J9"&gt;Google released the first public beta for Android 12 during its I/O event in the spring, and now Beta 4 is rolling out to compatible devices. Instead of a few previously unseen features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576164/android-12-beta-3-auto-rotate-screenshot-scrolling"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525023/android-12-beta-2-wifi-privacy-location-microphone-camera"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt;, this version moves things into the “platform stability” section of the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XevF6owqylL7eexDvbXRkTASgEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775536/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 beta release schedule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gL73km"&gt;For users trying to dive into the next version of Android as soon as possible, this means things are stabilizing as development proceeds toward a release candidate. The people this release is really important for are &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"&gt;Android developers&lt;/a&gt;, who can test their apps for compatibility now that the APIs, features, and layout have been locked down. With Google introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the biggest system redesign in years&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of areas where an app could run into trouble — double-check those widgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SEpYVQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 preview: here’s Google’s radical new design ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s3Sax5"&gt;Android 12’s refreshed approach to privacy and security is another potential obstacle for apps that haven’t been updated. There’s the privacy dashboard that consolidates settings, alerts when an app snoops on the clipboard for any copy / paste information, and the ability to grant an app access to either your precise or approximate location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGWRY4"&gt;As always, you can register for the beta and see if your phone is eligible to participate &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s phones from the Pixel 3 forward are candidates, along with &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;certain phones&lt;/a&gt; made by Asus, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, and ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pay and Messages updates are coming to existing Wear OS watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lilJjbl8MlyY6M79RfrbwkaSkig=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710987/3._Google_Pay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pay on Wear OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GPvVbT"&gt;Today’s smartwatch news has been dominated by Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;Wear OS 3-powered wearables&lt;/a&gt;, but Google wants you to know it hasn’t forgotten about &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/120789017/new-and-updated-app-experiences-coming-to-wear-os?hl=en&amp;amp;msgid=120789017"&gt;smartwatches running Wear OS 2&lt;/a&gt;. Updates to Google Pay, Messages, and other third-party apps will be coming to current devices &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4"&gt;in addition to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, giving existing owners something to look forward to as they roll out over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJCqeq"&gt;For starters, Google Pay’s support for contactless payments from smartwatches is expanding to 16 new countries: Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, and United Arab Emirates. It’s previously been possible to use &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/7454247"&gt;Google Pay from smartphones in these countries&lt;/a&gt;, but not from smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iBseDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More is coming to Wear OS 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qTg7yv"&gt;Next up, Google says that its Messages Wear OS app will have improved performance so you can easily use it without taking out your phone. The messages will sync with your paired phone so everything that happens in your wrist is still updated in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUOTer"&gt;Finally, there are also “new experiences” on the way from third-party apps like Calm, Komoot, Period Tracker, Sleep Cycle, Spotify, and Strava. Google says that “many” of these apps will include support for Tiles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Google’s glanceable widgets&lt;/a&gt; that offer quick tidbits of information from supported apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkwC1p"&gt;As well as Google’s existing Wear OS 2 operating system, these features are also coming to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches. Here, they’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch4"&gt;joined by&lt;/a&gt; a new YouTube Music app, with support for offline downloads, and a redesigned Google Maps app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tetris Effect: Connected is finally coming to the Switch in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tetris Effect: Connected" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJJFIVto_sqDqe0L6OQ5iPrMauw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710720/Tetris_Effect_Connected_Xbox_KeyArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Enhance Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b33RFn"&gt;The greatest &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; game of the last decade is finally coming to the Switch. As a part of today’s Indie World Showcase, Nintendo announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will arrive on the Switch October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU3uZb"&gt;Coming off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335590/tetris-effect-connected-xbox-series-x-multiplayer-expansion-release-date"&gt;timed exclusivity period&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox and Xbox Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected &lt;/em&gt;is the multiplayer expansion of 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator behind the trippy musical shooter &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; combined speedy block stacking with slick and impossibly pretty visuals and sounds. In &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;, classic &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; gameplay remained unchanged. Players still dropped various shaped blocks into brain-pleasing configurations, clearing rows as stacks of blocks slowly piled up. But &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; was also a full-on audiovisual sensory experience complete with colorful sights and chill sounds that added a new layer of depth to the 1984 classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QoQKb"&gt;Released on Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and VR platforms, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; received a multiplayer upgrade in 2020 with &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected. Connected&lt;/em&gt; added online or local cross-platform multiplayer and co-op modes, allowing players to go head to head or work together in search of the ever elusive row-obliterating Tetris. Though initially exclusive to Xbox and Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; will hit all platforms later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHJKGt"&gt;Instagram has been in the news this summer after Black soccer stars in England were bombarded with racist messages following their team’s Euro 2020 final loss. Today, the company’s &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/protecting-our-community-from-abuse-on-instagram/"&gt;trying to prevent&lt;/a&gt; some of that behavior from happening again with the introduction and expansion of three safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nHQ1a"&gt;Among them is something called “limits.” Turning this on prevents anyone who doesn’t follow you, or who recently followed you, from commenting or sending a DM. The feature is available to everyone globally today, and Instagram points out that it’ll likely be most useful to businesses and creators who expect a flurry of responses. Of course, turning comments or DMs off entirely would also work, but Instagram says this is a solution for people who still want the possibility of positively engaging with their community. The company says it’s also “exploring ways” to preemptively suggest that people turn this feature on when it detects a spike in activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O127Eb"&gt;Additionally, Instagram is building out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;hidden words feature&lt;/a&gt; that launched in April, which allows people to automatically filter DMs with offensive words, phrases, and emoji, relegating them to a hidden folder. The feature now has a wider list of potentially offensive words, emoji, and hashtags. And finally, the app is issuing sterner warnings to people who try to post offensive comments. (This type of messaging already existed but only appeared if someone attempted to post multiple times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFPVTH"&gt;“We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse,” the company writes in a press release. “We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXEeOf"&gt;The racist harassment of the soccer stars — Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, and Jadon Sancho — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; Prince William and UK prime minister Boris Johnson to speak out, along with England’s Football Association. Instagram clearly had to do something, and these new features may offer some help, at least to the people who find them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kidney transplant patients will test a COVID-19 booster shot in new trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Vaccinations Are Rebounding in the&amp;amp;nbsp;U.S. Covid Hot Spots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRyJPIRSHNFyXG29VJz4-fScSoo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710665/1234456149.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vYan8"&gt;The National Institutes of Health is giving a booster&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dose to 200 kidney transplant patients who did not have an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine in a &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-study-third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-kidney-transplant-recipients"&gt;new trial&lt;/a&gt; that launched yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bAm5E"&gt;Many transplant patients, who have to take immunosuppressant drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting a new organ, don’t produce enough antibodies — or don’t produce antibodies at all — after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The study will check to see if a third shot of an mRNA vaccine, given on top of the normal two-shot regimen, will generate antibodies closer to the levels seen in healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJ4I7V"&gt;There are some indications that a third dose might help some people. In France, health officials started recommending in April that immunosuppressed patients get a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Half of the patients who did not respond to two shots produced antibodies after the third, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782538"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 159 kidney transplant patients. The other half, though, still had no response. In Germany, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Citation/9000/Cellular_And_Humoral_Immune_Responses_after_Three.95188.aspx"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; of 48 transplant patients found that 40 percent who didn’t respond to two doses had a response after the third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zknG"&gt;Two other trials looking at kidney transplant patients are also kicking off in &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04961229"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-535930/v1"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3yIcV"&gt;It’s possible that the existing body of research might be enough for health officials in the US to start recommending that immunocompromised patients get a third shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will take up the question at its meeting on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzc3lg"&gt;Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are available under an emergency use authorization in the US that specifies two doses for the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots. In order for a third shot to become standard for any group, one of two things would have to happen: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would have to amend that authorization to include the option for an additional shot, or the agency would have to fully approve the vaccines. Once they’re approved, doctors could prescribe a third dose under a practice called off-label use, which lets doctors use pharmaceuticals based on their judgment even if they’re not technically cleared for a particular purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS0EhC"&gt;Some people in the US are already skirting the FDA and seeking out third shots. More than &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-fe8ecebb3b61c7d3ee8ed4225500cb0e"&gt;900 people&lt;/a&gt; have received a third shot in the US, according to data collected by the CDC, and it’s likely an undercount. &lt;/p&gt;
