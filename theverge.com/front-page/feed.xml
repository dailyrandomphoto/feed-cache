    <title>One of Samsung’s best phones ever is now officially retired</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CVLJg"&gt;Four years after its launch, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has received its last security update. The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjJvyk"&gt;The S8 marked a design shift for Galaxy devices, with a wider-aspect edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezels that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications"&gt;one of the best-looking phones&lt;/a&gt; we’d seen at that point. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;wasn’t just a good-looking device, either&lt;/a&gt;; it offered excellent hardware and a great camera, combined with a remarkably restrained software implementation. Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DuyWyZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has one of the best support policies in the industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5X9xL1"&gt;Samsung recently introduced a formal policy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;providing Galaxy devices with four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, including both S-series flagships and even budget-oriented A-series models. Premium devices tend to get monthly updates, at least for the first couple of years, with the cadence slowing down to quarterly or biannual updates toward end of life. It’s one of the best support policies in the industry — certainly for Android, and roughly on par with Apple’s typically lengthy device support schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGe1su"&gt;While the S8 and S8 Plus have reached the end of that support period, the S8 Active is still &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;on the schedule&lt;/a&gt; for quarterly updates and the S8 Lite is on the biannual schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this devastating look at cancers going undiagnosed during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Radiology center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAjv-LadnOxNwY9Jnjjjw17oE5k=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235315/838190898.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sa3dSK"&gt;In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as people avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals canceled nonessential appointments, routine cancer screenings plummeted. Now, we’re starting to see the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDnlfN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of Teresa Ruvalcaba, a factory worker in Chicago who ignored searing pain in her chest for six months. She was busy with work and afraid of catching COVID-19 at the doctor’s office, and when she finally went to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with advanced inflammatory breast cancer. It was one of the most severe cases oncologist Pam Khosla had seen in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9ca98"&gt;Cancer death rates have dropped over 30 percent since the early 1990s, a decline fueled by early detection and new treatments. But the past year caused an extraordinary, unprecedented disruption in cancer care. People didn’t come to the hospital until their health had deteriorated so badly that they struggled to breathe, Khosla described to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="O7tYl5"&gt;Recently, she counted at least 10 cases of advanced cancer in one four-week period. She saw one patient with a grapefruit-sized mass on his neck. Another, whose tumor had pushed his brain dangerously close to the skull, was transferred to hospice. “He never got to see the light of treatment,” Khosla said. All of these patients had been afraid to seek treatment at the hospital during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HxQnKJ"&gt;It’ll be years before we see the full extent of the harm caused by pandemic-driven delays in cancer treatment. The National Cancer Institute predicts that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;postponements&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in diagnosing breast and colorectal cancer will lead to around 10,000 excess deaths in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhqeLS"&gt;Ruvalcaba’s story adds a face to the faceless statistics around diagnosis delays and shows in vivid detail how the ripple effects from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to quietly impact families all across the country for years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOUFdG"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-crisis-of-undiagnosed-cancers-is-emerging-in-the-pandemics-second-year"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new originals starring Will Smith and Alicia Keys  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3snEN5Uw3pl39bB5UkHWbkXWGQ=/233x0:2180x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235189/will_smith_brandcast.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Will Smith has a new fitness show coming to YouTube. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="we1uTI"&gt;YouTube announced a new slate of original series today that includes some huge stars at the top of the lineup. Will Smith will star in a six-part reality series about fitness and “returning his body into the best shape of his life,” and a four-part series will go behind the scenes with Alicia Keys as she records a new album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHJ3vY"&gt;The new lineup of originals also includes a third season of Liza Koshy’s &lt;em&gt;Liza on Demand&lt;/em&gt;; a new special focused on Asian American chefs, celebrities, activists, and creators that counts LeBron James and Michelle Kwan as executive producers; and a new special called &lt;em&gt;Barbershop Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that explores the intersection of race and socioeconomic status that came out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505891/youtube-black-voices-fund-first-originals-slate-announced"&gt;the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund&lt;/a&gt; that was announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbNkvi"&gt;YouTube has regularly changed up its approach to original content since it started making originals about five years ago. They started out as subscriber-only shows centered around creators, pivoted to ad-supported shows featuring mainstream stars like Kevin Hart and Will Smith (making this his second&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;YouTube original), and more recently have delivered more of a mix of the two, with most shows being largely available to anyone who visits YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNjwKD"&gt;Still, big names like Will Smith and Alicia Keys guarantee views, and they provide credibility to YouTube and comfort for advertisers who may be worried about some of the platform’s wilder content. These series were, not coincidentally, announced in the middle of a YouTube presentation for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkpXdM"&gt;Will Smith’s new series will debut next year; Alicia Keys’ arrives this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus buys Sanho and its Hyper line of accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sKYdxjskUIQmn07vJsTwmJJzlkQ=/38x0:1544x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235146/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_12.11.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BC4uX"&gt;Two companies that have built their businesses on computer accessories are coming together. Targus, a company best known for its laptop cases and bags, today &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Ftargus-to-acquire-hyper-by-sanho-corporation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419204%2Ftargus-acquires-sanho-hyper-drive-usb-c-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced that it’s acquiring Sanho&lt;/a&gt;. You might not be familiar with Sanho itself, but it’s more likely you’d recognize the company’s Hyper and HyperDrive lineup of USB-C accessories that are sold on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3Dhyperdrive&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA5bLz"&gt;Targus CEO Mikel Williams said the deal “allows for Targus to add capability and support to Hyper’s growing tech brand, and gives Hyper access to new channels, customers and a global footprint of sales and marketing resources.” Williams added that “Hyper has a strong and exciting brand that has excellent reach into the Apple community and, importantly, the combination also brings really talented people to our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgXqdR"&gt;That “reach” Williams mentions is probably a reference to the USB-C hubs that Hyper specifically designs to fit and latch onto Apple’s MacBooks and iPad Pro devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPebkEixHN9Xkw8bqvMXoaLFgCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491130/hyper.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyper&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RWwB5Q"&gt;The company has also recently launched more powerful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fcollections%2Fenterprise-usb-c-docking-stations&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419204%2Ftargus-acquires-sanho-hyper-drive-usb-c-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Gen2” USB-C hubs&lt;/a&gt; that offer faster performance than earlier models. “We focus on first-to-market, award winning innovative products, that will bring long term value to the combined company,” said Daniel Chin, Hyper’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1r0DY"&gt;Chin will continue to oversee Hyper as president. Targus and Hyper will maintain their separate brand identities and stay in their respective headquarters. (Targus is based in Anaheim, California, and Hyper operates out of the Silicon Valley area.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood crypto trading crashed during a Dogecoin spike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUSRA-44RxnmgY4TDA0JWBJZtN8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235047/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JqQqnJ"&gt;Robinhood ran into issues processing cryptocurrency trades this morning, during a spike in the price of Dogecoin that sent users flocking to the app. The website &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/robinhood/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; shows the outage starting around 9:30AM ET and reducing in severity about an hour later. Robinhood confirmed that it experienced a “partial outage” in crypto trading and said the issues had been resolved as of 11:15AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tq2Zmv"&gt;The outage was particularly noticeable since it came during a spike (and subsequent dip) in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fdogecoin&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419159%2Frobinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dogecoin prices&lt;/a&gt;. Coins were priced at around $0.40 USD at the beginning of the day. Around 8AM ET, they spiked past $0.50 USD and reached as high as $0.60 USD near 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CSWeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: Crypto trading is now fully restored. We know some customers may have experienced intermittent issues earlier. We’ll continue to monitor the situation closely and we’re sorry if you were impacted. Please contact us if you have outstanding issues. &lt;a href="https://t.co/adhugIHVGR"&gt;https://t.co/adhugIHVGR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskRobinhood/status/1389599614559346697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ic481"&gt;Users were quick to voice their frustrations with the app on Twitter, seeing it as a repeat of the situation that happened in January when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;Robinhood limited trading&lt;/a&gt; on buzzy, soaring stocks, including GameStop and AMC. In the app this morning, a message told users, “We are experiencing intermittent issues with crypto trading. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.” Meanwhile, the price ticker on Dogecoin continued its rapid flip up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTVcbl"&gt;Robinhood has made it incredibly easy for anyone to become an amateur trader of stocks or cryptocurrencies. But that’s also meant that problems with Robinhood can affect markets, since it may be the only route that a mass of traders circling a buzzy asset have to place a buy or sell order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFAK95"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;the second Dogecoin-related crypto trading outage&lt;/a&gt; on Robinhood in a matter of weeks. On April 16th, Robinhood wrote that enthusiasm for Dogecoin led to “sporadic crypto order failures.” At the time, the company said, “These interruptions aren’t acceptable to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyUXSx"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;expected to go public&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will now let you auto-caption Stories with just a sticker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gif of an Instagram story showing a person speaking and the words “It’s a beautiful day out here so we’re gonna go on a walk” appearing at the top of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qYaIDti6FUu0Jrf7IApB5sXggk=/84x0:1004x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234951/Stories_viewer_captions.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQmdNQ"&gt;Instagram now has a captions sticker for Stories, which will automatically transcribe speech in videos. The sticker will be available only in “English and English-speaking countries” for now but will eventually roll out to other languages and countries. Instagram says it will also start testing automated captions in Reels soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MuwQ4"&gt;Captions have been available in IGTV and the Threads app, and Instagram says it’s adding them to Stories and Reels to make them more efficient and inclusive to watch. The feature should be a welcome addition for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, are not native English speakers, or just generally watch videos without sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of words from the top to the bottom of the screen that say “are you a stinky little baby?” in front of a photo of a miniature dachshund sitting on a couch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iahVkkC65bVv6ZxY815tfOPNWsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489380/stinky_baby_transcript.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The edit option lists each word of the captions separately. You can tap on individual words to make adjustments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ob9iM"&gt;Like other text options in Stories, users can adjust the style and color of the captions after they’re generated. People can also edit individual words in the captions to correct spelling, punctuation, or any words that weren’t transcribed accurately. Auto captions rarely have perfect accuracy, especially for people with accents or atypical speech, so editing is crucial. There’s currently no option to have the text highlighted for better visual contrast, but you can use the draw tool or a sticker behind the captions to make them easier to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRlVG"&gt;Other platforms and services have recently added or improved auto-captioning options. Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams all offer automated captions for video calls. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337074/chrome-real-time-live-captions-audio-accessibility"&gt;expanded its Live Caption feature&lt;/a&gt; across the Chrome browser in March, and TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369507/tiktok-automatic-captions-accessibility-feature-american-english-japanese"&gt;launched automatic captions&lt;/a&gt; for American English and Japanese last month. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s planning improvements for the captioning it offers in Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrLMk1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial started on Monday, and if you wanted to follow along and listen to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney talk about the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” your options were limited. In theory, there’s public access to the trial, like most court proceedings, but since the courthouse is still closed for lockdown, the only access was through the court’s teleconference line that was briefly overrun by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417347/epic-games-apple-fortnite-trial-public-call"&gt;screaming teens&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuIgNO"&gt;But for anyone looking for more user-friendly options, there’s good news. A surprising, small community of streamers has decided to rebroadcast the trial on streaming platforms — places built for the people who play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;rather than the antitrust policy wonks in the courtroom. For yesterday’s proceeding, I found a handful of YouTube channels and streamers rebroadcasting the hearing online, including Geoff Keighley (gaming’s Ryan Seacrest) on the Game Awards YouTube channel. Keighley’s YouTube stream sat at around 1,000 viewers throughout Monday’s events, featuring an active side chat filled with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans and foes negging the day’s witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wW2h1"&gt;Technically, you’re not supposed to do this. &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/cases-e-filing/cases-of-interest/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;The court’s website&lt;/a&gt; explicitly tells users that “any recording, copying, or rebroadcasting of a remote court hearing is absolutely prohibited.” Electronic recording devices &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/supreme-court-video"&gt;are often banned&lt;/a&gt; from public sessions for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIF6SS"&gt;But because you’re breaking the court’s rules and not copyright law, streaming the trial is much less likely to result in an account strike than a sports or television live stream. And while conventional media outlets could have their press credentials stripped for defying the ban, most streamers are far enough outside that system that they don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZdr3c"&gt;A separate &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;streamer, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmpwZJPSf_QPSKxY9CFCstg"&gt;Golden&lt;/a&gt; (112,000 subscribers), was also following the court hearing, providing commentary for his followers interested in the day’s events. In order to avoid ticking off the court, he muted the trial’s audio and provided a link to Keighley’s stream for viewers looking to follow along themselves. He also listed his Discord server in the video’s bio and had three audio rooms dedicated to re-streaming Keighley’s audio. The Discord’s general chat was a mix of armchair antitrust lawyers and others complaining about Sweeney’s bad mic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcAJiv"&gt;“Bruh this audio,” one person wrote, responding to Sweeney’s mumbling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7vrjf"&gt;It’s hard to say how many streamers will be active for today’s proceedings — but if you’re hoping to follow along, searching YouTube and Twitch for rebroadcasts might turn up more options than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o02Oo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Bad Batch is a glimpse at the future of Star Wars spinoffs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Bad Batch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KzmRsbdHVThfpFwoXPT02jlBj4=/350x0:1570x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234691/ANM_011797__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEm2jX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; has arrived today as the latest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; spinoff series for &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1061256/9358?subId1=VergeBadBatch&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-bad-batch%2F4gMliqFxxqXC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different, smaller show than preceding animated shows like &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on a single squad of clone troopers, &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Force_99"&gt;Clone Force 99&lt;/a&gt; — the titular “Bad Batch” — and its struggle to find a place in the galaxy following the rise of the Empire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enUx8e"&gt;Unlike the other clone troopers, the Bad Batch’s members were cloned with an emphasis on specific genetic abnormalities. Hunter, for example, has improved senses, while Wrecker is far larger and stronger than the average clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pur6ch"&gt;The Bad Batch was first introduced in the resurrected seventh season of Dave Filoni’s animated &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; series (which was brought back after its original cancellation in 2013 following Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm) in an episode practically designed as a backdoor pilot for further spinoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHsj0D"&gt;Knowledge of the previous seven seasons of &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; or the four seasons of &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt; isn’t essential to enjoying &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch, &lt;/em&gt;at least for now. The show takes plenty of time to reintroduce the squad at the start of the extended first episode. Although, familiarity with the broad events of &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt; and the downfall of the Republic are helpful. Knowing show creator Dave Filoni’s preference for referencing his other series, it’s almost guaranteed that &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch &lt;/em&gt;will eventually cross over with characters and events from &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt;, or even &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; at some point down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2E5ke1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsOmYpP4UDU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZDEFK"&gt;And that’s sort of the whole point. &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch &lt;/em&gt;is an early preview of the next wave of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows: a tower of spinoffs of spinoffs, each interlinking with and building off the previous shows and films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08r4Q3"&gt;It’s something we’ve already seen the first glimpses of on the live-action side. The success of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season has already spawned not one but three different spinoffs (&lt;em&gt;Ashoka, Rangers of the New Republic, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;), which will eventually culminate in an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;-esque crossover in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="V8Qxk5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10482072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3D20vH"&gt;If any of that sounds familiar, it’s because Disney is already using a virtually identical tactic with its Marvel Studios films and Disney Plus shows: building an interconnected storyline that spans a wide range of shows and movies to draw viewers in and keep them subscribed to Disney Plus &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; headed to theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZNCEy"&gt;Disney tried something similar before with its first attempts at breaking &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; out of the Skywalker Saga mold, but cinematic spinoffs like &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt; didn’t quite turn into the breakout successes on par with the more mainstream movies. However, those films were aimed at being connective tissue, filling in the missing links between episodes or shading in the histories of characters we had already met. Instead of making &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; feel like a bigger universe, they had the adverse effect of making it feel smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICKqnA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; looks to solve that issue with a tighter focus on a relatively new group of clones that are striking out on their own. It’s not the broad scope of the sweeping conflict of the entire Clone Wars or the start of the fledgling Rebellion, which means it’ll hopefully be able to carve out a new area of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe instead of just rehashing old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YzWGd"&gt;A lot of that depends on how independent of a series &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt;’s creators want to make. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, for example, appeared to be on a similar trajectory to start, but its second season saw the show fall squarely back into the mainstream &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; path with Luke Skywalker cameos, Boba Fett guest episodes, darksaber duels, and more. It’s easy to imagine &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; going down a similar route. (The first episode, for example, already sees an appearance from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;’s Saw Gerrera and a more subtle &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt; cameo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlEwD4"&gt;Hopefully, though, &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; will be the first of a new wave of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs that charts its own course in the universe with new stories. Because with the number of Disney Plus shows and movies on Disney’s docket, branching out to new parts of the galaxy will be essential — after all, there’s still a lot of galaxy left to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3shbUI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ben Wheatley’s In The Earth finds horror in fungi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4jnPAhLcRQA0URtWfasmke5BIg=/201x0:2360x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69234505/50641388823_e3014984fd_3k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Earth.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Neon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An unsettling film that evades the genre’s usual tropes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="O4ag4K"&gt;The way that we segment history can be divided into two eras: before the advent of penicillin and after — or, in other words, pre-antibiotics and post-antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKB5G0"&gt;Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html"&gt;discovered in 1928&lt;/a&gt; by Scottish microbiologist Alexander Fleming, who found that the juices from the &lt;em&gt;Penicillium &lt;/em&gt;fungi were able to destroy harmful bacteria. Medicine was transformed forever, and to this day, penicillin is prescribed for everything from lung infections to sexually transmitted illnesses. This extraordinary elixir was by no means produced by fungi by chance, for &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-are-mushrooms-more-like-humans-than-they-are-like-p-5940434"&gt;in some ways&lt;/a&gt; fungi operate more akin to humans and animals than plants. One of the reasons that we derive so many antibiotics from fungi is because we are more closely related to them than any other kingdom of organism, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/paul_stamets"&gt;a 2008 TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; by famed American mycologist Paul Stamets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huvO1h"&gt;These properties of fungi — the ones that are used for antibiotic and antiviral medications — weigh heavy on the mind as the world is ravaged by a pandemic. With more than a year passing since COVID-19 was first reported, public discourse, concern, and the overall collective imagination &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/opinion/covid-vaccines-poor-countries.html"&gt;has shifted&lt;/a&gt; from focusing on the virus itself to, now, being more interested in its deterrent: the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQq9TP"&gt;So when Ben Wheatley’s newest film &lt;em&gt;In The Earth &lt;/em&gt;opens on a sight familiar to all of us — that of social distancing, quarantine, and protective gear — we can only imagine that the mission that takes Dr. Martin Lowery (Joel Fry) deep into an English forest as part of a project studying fungi is in aims of finding a vaccine. The words “COVID-19” are never actually uttered within the movie, but there is no doubt what inspired Wheatley’s latest effort, especially as it was filmed in &lt;a href="https://observer.com/2021/04/ben-wheatley-interview-in-the-earth/"&gt;the summer of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eQq2Kh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The pandemic was inescapable at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262520/sundance-film-festival-2021-pandemic-these-days-pink-cloud"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a34A9Y"&gt;But Martin, and accompanying park scout Alma (Ellora Torchia), aren’t venturing into the dense English forest in search of a cure. Instead, they are on a mission to reach a research hub where Dr. Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires) is attempting to understand the fungal network that connects the trees and plants in every forest and field around the world. Understanding this network better will help them with crop yield, Martin explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Cd5xn"&gt;You see, fungi’s ability to facilitate antibiotics is not their only marvel. In fact, their most compelling attribute is not something that can be visibly observed in the mushrooms and mold that flourish above ground. It is below the surface, subterranean: a complex web of fungal strands that connect in what is called a “mycorrhizal network,” often referred to as the “Wood Wide Web,” which connect the roots of different types of plants in any given plain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="8WQO3e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Lqkfo7IymU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJWGc3"&gt;Jean-Marc Moncalvo, a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum and a professor in the ecology department at the University of Toronto, explains to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the white filaments of fungi that grow underground — called “mycelium” — form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants, and effectively connect different species within a forest or a field through a massive, expansive web. The communication that occurs within the fungi is complicated to decrypt, but mycologists have ideas of what the plants are “saying” to one another. Many of these interactions are to warn of danger. “If there is an infection in a plant,” Moncalvo says, “other [unaffected] plants react. It seems that this is ‘volatile chemicals’ at work, like, for instance, how ants communicate through pheromones.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5vujw"&gt;Moncalvo goes on to explain that this web does more than just spread caution. “This idea of network and the World Wide Web is not just communication of information, it’s also the translocation of nutrients between individual plants in the forest. Eighty percent of land plants are associated with mycelium in their root system. What the plant gains is access to more water and nutrients, what the fungi takes from this exchange is sugar.” He compares this network to a brain: a complex tangle of neurons that connect and interact with one another with different aims and function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWn99g"&gt;And as Dr. Wendle buries herself deep in a thicketed forest to study this mode of subterranean communication, Martin, Alma, and the outside world grapple with what it means to communicate in an environment that abruptly transitioned into quarantine and social distancing. The beginning of Martin and Alma’s trip into the forest is filled with awkward silences: we have to wonder whether Martin’s dry manner of speech is due to his previous isolation or simply a character trait. It is only when Martin and Alma run into Zach (Reece Shearsmith) a day into their trek that &lt;em&gt;In the Earth &lt;/em&gt;takes on the Lovecraftian tone — brooding score, gore, existential confrontations, and all — that defines its horror for the remainder of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="08lI9J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The film acknowledges both the mysteries of the natural world and our connectedness to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fs1GX2"&gt;Zach lives in a tented canopy off the grid and is obsessed with a different type of communication: that of contacting Parnag Fegg, a folk tale that speaks of a spirit that inhabits the woods. His pursuit is mystical. There’s a kind of funny irony in a man isolating himself deep in a forest — the secrets of whose plants and fungi scientists have yet to crack — only to focus on the esoteric. Martin and Alma eventually reach Dr. Wendle, but the lines of reason that we expected to separate the scientific and the folklore are blurred by Wheatley in a psychedelic way, a disorientation akin to that of ingesting magic mushrooms (which, rest assured, are featured in the film).     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDRE9x"&gt;Wheatley’s tale succeeds in being a horror entry that simultaneously acknowledges both the mysteries of the natural world and our connectedness to it despite that. However, when noting the connection between man and earth, it is necessary to recognize that Indigenous people have long known of the properties of fungi, as described in Potawatomi botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer’s brilliant books &lt;em&gt;Gathering Moss &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Braiding Sweetgrass. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlJc4_dYrEDHuytexe1YwTbpjmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22487886/IN_THE_EARTH_Joel_Fry_Ellora_Torchia_courtesy_of_NEON_copy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;In The Earth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTqRxn"&gt;In the film, two distinct tales lure the four characters into the forest: one of fungi weaving the roots of beeches, ashes, and cedars together to communicate, and one of the spirit of the woods, a &lt;em&gt;Blair Witch&lt;/em&gt;-like folktale. But what makes &lt;em&gt;In The Earth &lt;/em&gt;truly remarkable is that Wheatley doesn’t posit these two systems that have historically been seen as opposites, as incongruous. Wheatley’s thesis is that scientific discovery does not have to be sterilized of the whims and emotions of the human being. It’s a symbiotic relationship that can serve as an allegory for the ways in which fungi and plants merge to form an environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRWRav"&gt;“One has to look at nature and organisms as an interconnected system,” Moncalvo asserts. “We tend to say that the unit is the species — there’s the fungi, the plants, the animals — but the understanding should be that the ecosystem is the unit.” Superimposing this paradigm onto Wheatley’s film, the units of the human — emotion and reason — should also be viewed as informing one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WrbB0j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"One day, your home could be made with mushrooms","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22257120/mushroom-bricks-mycelium-sustainable-building-materials"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BZS69P"&gt;This idea of connectivity has begun to emerge within horror cinema as both a visual motif and a narrative premise. In Alex Garland’s 2018 sci-fi horror film &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;, based on the book of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, a group of scientists venture into a zone occupied by an anomaly referred to as “Shimmer.” The film’s most haunting visuals are those of skeletons belonging to scientists who had lost their lives on previous expeditions, springing with vines, mosses, and flowers. Whatever this “Shimmer” is, it merges the molecular makeup of all that is alive, indiscriminate to which kingdom the being belongs. A similar tableau characterizes a mysterious entity in &lt;em&gt;Apostle&lt;/em&gt;, a horror film directed by Gareth Evans and also released in 2018, where humans are entangled in the roots of an island and serve as its environmental guardians.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Iq12"&gt;And it’s something that hasn’t escaped the grips of horror television, either: in the first season of NBC’s &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt;, the second episode, entitled “Amuse-Bouche,” focuses on a pharmacist who buries people alive to facilitate the growth of fungi on their body. The pharmacist, Eldon Stammets, is named after the aforementioned mycologist, who Mancolvo labels a leading and important voice in the study of mycorrhizae.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB4Vfq"&gt;Following its debut at the Sundance Film Festival this past January, &lt;em&gt;In The Earth&lt;/em&gt; received a lukewarm reception, and for an understandable reason: fans expecting a traditional horror film would not find one here. Other than a few moments of classic body horror, the narrative and visuals of the film evade the usual tropes of the genre. But &lt;em&gt;In The Earth &lt;/em&gt;is a good indicator of the direction in which horror is moving: meditative probes into humanity’s place in the natural world. While the horror movies that characterized the previous decades were largely concerned with the supernatural severed from ecology — spirits haunting homes, people, or heirlooms — writers and directors have gradually been shifting the sensibilities of the genre to consider the fungi and plants that sustain the Earth’s life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zHmwy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The Earth —&lt;/em&gt; with its psychedelic interludes of plant imagery, edited in a way that resembles the freneticism of a Guy Maddin film, and its haunting synth score, composed by &lt;a href="https://www.brooklynvegan.com/listen-to-clint-mansells-intense-eerie-in-the-earth-synth-score/"&gt;Clint Mansell&lt;/a&gt; — is a challenging but worthwhile film. One that simultaneously questions and proclaims the connection man has with earth, and science with mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Q5FIDy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;In The Earth &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is currently playing in theaters, and will be available digitally on May 7th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair right now is for $190 at Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UPRyK"&gt;If that deal sells out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are selling them for $197. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the AirPods Pros for $200, while &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $29 off, bringing the price down to $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
