    <title>Tinder will now quiz you on your vibes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQLktU6lkTMjYeVUyZ203MvpRys=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236675/VRG_ILLO_3795_tinder.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sr0SRf"&gt;Tinder wants to give you more info on what you and a match have in common, so it’s launching a new quiz feature to help out. The quizzes, called Vibes, will pop up once a week and ask an assortment of goofy questions, from “_____ is not picnic food” to “Are you always 20 minutes early or 10 minutes late?” If another person gave the same answers as you, those answers will appear on their profile or, if you match, in your chat together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIquEK"&gt;Vibes isn’t turning Tinder into a full-on OkCupid rival for endless, silly personality quiz questions. The answers are temporary, vanishing after a few days. So you’ll have to return to the app and answer new questions the following week if you want to participate again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The question asks “How do you feel about cooking?” Answers including three options: “A nicer Gordon Ramsay,” “Low-key would rather starve,” “For survival only.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0aWYw2HyCxG--CVmcKV1AR7oJc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491534/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_1.11.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A question from Tinder’s Vibes quiz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/phLb16RdwQzj_e6Dgau69abA0pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491533/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_1.01.59_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tinder showing common Vibes answers in a chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxrW1l"&gt;Tinder has already been testing the quizzes since last year, and it says they’ve increased “likes and matches across the board.” (Though the company doesn’t provide a specific figure on how much likes and matches have increased.) Vibes seems to be the latest attempt by Tinder to increase engagement and give users more to talk about. The app previously ran &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156306/tinder-swipe-night-choose-your-own-adventure-series-second-season"&gt;an interactive video series&lt;/a&gt; that let users talk about which decisions they made for its characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJM1tk"&gt;The feature starts rolling out today and will be available globally in late May.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney emailed Tim Cook personally to call for open app sales after WWDC in 2015</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook (Verge, 640)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbe3UHKqsId6fTW2JmCFhhPSQg4=/0x0:716x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236646/tim-cook_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdmmXn"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was asking Apple to open its phones to other app stores as early as 2015, according to new emails made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the companies’ antitrust trial&lt;/a&gt;. Under the subject line “iOS as an open platform,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios"&gt;emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook directly&lt;/a&gt; to make the case for allowing other app stores to distribute software on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biLoWU"&gt;“The App Store has done much good for the industry,” Sweeney wrote to Cook, “but it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtfE9M"&gt;In particular, Sweeney asked to “separate iOS App Store curation from compliance review and app distribution,” essentially suggesting that Apple could maintain its security features across the platform without routing all downloads through the central App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nZVAkS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it doesn’t seem tenable for Apple to be the sole arbiter of expression and commerce over an app platform approaching a billion users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="roU80u"&gt;It’s a powerful distinction for the ongoing trial, in which Apple is arguing that App Store exclusivity is necessary to maintain the existing security and privacy features on iOS. These are part of the compliance process referenced by Sweeney in the email, and other ecosystems have been successful in implementing them across multiple app stores. Most recently, Google introduced a similar system on Android &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect"&gt;under the name Play Protect&lt;/a&gt;, guarding against malicious downloads even from side-loaded software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oVmTZ"&gt;Cook responded by forwarding the message to Phil Schiller with a question: “Is this the guy that was at one of our rehearsals?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2UxLp"&gt;It’s likely that he was: a few weeks earlier, Epic Games had made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChIuImrOsaY"&gt;an appearance at Apple’s WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, touting the company’s work using Apple’s Metal API, although Sweeney did not appear onstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C8jWzT"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20697668-tim-sweeney-tim-cook-email-open-ios/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Tim-Sweeney-Tim-Cook-Email-open-ios (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXtBs"&gt;Other emails show Sweeney continuing to push Apple behind the scenes, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697673-px-2421"&gt;asking Epic co-founder Mark Rein&lt;/a&gt; to push for a meeting with Greg Joswiak in January 2018. “If the App Store [were] merely the premier way for consumers to install software and not the sole way, then Apple could curate higher quality software overall, without acting as a censor on free expression,” Sweeney argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcNNXA"&gt;Rein was ultimately able to arrange a hearing for the idea through Apple’s Tim Kirby and expressed enthusiasm. “He was definitely receptive to the idea,” Rein wrote, “which doesn’t mean it will go anywhere, but does mean he’ll line up people who will listen and not shoot it down like Phil Schiller would.... so maybe there’s a smallest little crack on the very outer surface of the many feet of ice covering the frozen lake that is the Apple store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3xn7J"&gt;Six years later, the ice has yet to thaw.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti keeps leaking ahead of rumored launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZynro3bRHH8UPFo40KBNptYzJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236642/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJsr7g"&gt;Nvidia appears to be getting ready to launch its RTX 3080 Ti graphics card later this month. Over the past few weeks, RTX 3080 Ti cards have reportedly been spotted on &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-ventus-3x-12gb-spotted-during-transit"&gt;shipping pallets&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-suprim-x-pictured"&gt;retail boxes&lt;/a&gt;, and now in the hands of someone. &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; has been at the center of tracking down Nvidia’s rumored RTX 3080 Ti card, and it &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-and-rtx-3070-ti-to-be-announced-on-may-31st-launching-in-june"&gt;reports the GPU will be launched on May 31st&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the RTX 3070 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co66Wj"&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. What this all means in terms of performance isn’t exactly clear yet, but it certainly looks like the RTX 3080 Ti will sit comfortably in between the RTX 3080 and the RTX 3090.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWNew6"&gt;That may mean we’re looking at another GPU from Nvidia that’s over the $1,000 mark, but given the scalper prices for the RTX 3080, that’s not exactly unusual now. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-suprim-x-pictured"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz &lt;/em&gt;spotted an MSI 3080 Ti late last week&lt;/a&gt;, and today YouTuber Moore’s Law Is Dead now claims to know someone with an unannounced Gigabyte RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cwssSB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to confirm from my end - the RTX 3080 Ti 12GB is certainly real, and coming soon™️.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I obviously blacked out the background to protect someone, but that's a real 3080 Ti someone I know has their hands on... &lt;a href="https://t.co/sn18aNbboa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sn18aNbboa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Moore's Law Is Dead (@mooreslawisdead) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mooreslawisdead/status/1389654429280972800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkqHCz"&gt;If the reports are accurate, we should be getting a lot more details about both the RTX 3080 Ti and the 3070 Ti later this month. Both cards are also rumored to ship with the same Ethereum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;cryptocurrency mining limiter&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia implemented with the RTX 3060. Nvidia accidentally removed this nerf with a driver update, before once again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409838/nvidia-rtx-3060-etherium-cryptocurrency-mining-limit-back-driver-update"&gt;reinstating the hash limiter last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNa64t"&gt;Either way, many people waiting to build PCs right now might not get overly excited about news of yet another GPU launch. It has been nearly impossible to buy RTX 30-series cards thanks to a global chip shortage and massive demand from PC gamers looking to upgrade. Launching yet another GPU won’t fix the supply and demand issues that Nvidia has already warned will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;continue throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit seems to be back after an almost hour-long outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2vKzcAlibL8-kd0U0P_0ybgIl9g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235972/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DigTHL"&gt;Reddit had a bit of a blip on Tuesday afternoon, going down for almost an hour. According to &lt;a href="https://reddit.statuspage.io/"&gt;Reddit’s status page&lt;/a&gt;, the issues started around 1:56PM ET. At 2:17PM ET, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; reports spiked, with around 45,000 users reporting problems connecting to its homepage and subreddits. Staff here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were also unable to load the site, with some getting a blank homepage and others experiencing slow loading times and getting kicked off of pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpb31n"&gt;The status page now indicates that Reddit has implemented a fix and is monitoring the results. While the status page still shows that there’s a partial outage, we were all able to successfully load and browse the site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yUjadmRB_CZ6BSrYAYs0qtbBP7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491591/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_11.56.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw8umB"&gt;Downdetector reports are also dropping, indicating that more users are seeing the same results that we are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rC2-4BpmpYy4ucfg1cy6M5fQWgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491586/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_11.54.52_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="osUf0N"&gt;Reddit did not reply to a request for information on what caused the outage, but we’ll update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYL0PH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NtIXE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the EPA’s new rules affecting air conditioners and refrigerators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Near-Record Heat Wave Grips U.S. East Coast, Midwest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IZatqgdhAfB4-2N3wvmk-OCZxXI=/0x472:3000x2472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235998/71570187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A shopper walks down an aisle of in-wall air conditioners at a Lowe’s home improvement store August 2, 2006 in Arlington Heights, Illinois.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IrCuUt"&gt;“Super” greenhouse gases will soon be phased down in air conditioners and refrigerators in the US. The Environmental Protection Agency yesterday proposed new rules to cut the use of the “super” pollutants used as refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), by 85 percent over 15 years. Consumers likely won’t notice much of a difference with their appliances, but lawmakers are anticipating big benefits for the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR3CeV"&gt;The EPA plans to determine a baseline for HFC production and consumption, and then set limits on companies making and importing HFCs. Those caps would become stricter over time. This is the agency’s first major new regulation taking on climate change under the Biden administration, and it makes good on a bipartisan commitment to regulate HFCs that passed in Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195522/stimulus-bill-phase-out-hfcs-super-greenhouse-gas"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; as part of the pandemic relief bill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WxiGAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s really nothing different that consumers will need to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w3tJt"&gt;While industry is ramping down the use of HFCs, there’s really nothing different that consumers will need to do with air conditioning units or refrigerators they already have. “There’s a sort of a misconception out there that is unfortunately fueled by some unscrupulous contractors that you have to change [equipment] out because these refrigerants are being phased down. That’s just not the case,” says Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a trade association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uhjHu"&gt;Refrigerants generally only need to be replaced if there’s a leak — it’s not a frequent part of regular maintenance. The new rule calls for HFC production and imports to be cut by 85 percent, which means there will still be enough of the refrigerants left to service old equipment. Companies also recycle HFCs from decommissioned units, which adds to the supply. There’s a chance that the cost of HFCs might rise slightly because of the more limited supply, but previous transitions to new refrigerants haven’t increased prices much in the past, Dietz says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jz6prF"&gt;When people purchase new equipment that uses different refrigerants, those units will pretty much look and operate the same way as older units. Dietz doesn’t anticipate any noticeable change in price, either. “If you were to ask somebody off the street right now what refrigerant is used in their air conditioner, 99.99999% would not be able to tell you. And there’s no reason for people to know that because the only thing they really need to know is that their equipment is as efficient as it is advertised to be, and that it is reliable,” Dietz says. “When this transition occurs, it is going to be seamless for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mE0EHh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time that industry has had to make a change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U06WV4"&gt;This isn’t the first time that industry has had to make a change because of environmental and health concerns with refrigerants. The 1987 Montreal Protocol phased down the other refrigerants called &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ods-phaseout"&gt;chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; that were &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/taking-measure/refrigerants-rescue-plugging-ozone-hole"&gt;burning a hole&lt;/a&gt; in the ozone layer, exposing people to more cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation from the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeIZAz"&gt;While HFCs kept the atmospheric ozone layer intact, the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol called for HFCs to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be replaced because of their impact on the climate. Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to ratify the Kigali Amendment earlier this year, reversing the Trump administration’s position on it. Trade groups like Dietz’s have supported the Kigali Amendment, saying that it keeps US manufacturers competitive in the global market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMxq2j"&gt;Air conditioners have helped to keep some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16290934/india-air-conditioner-cooler-design-climate-change-cept-symphony"&gt;cities livable in a warming world&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re also adding to the climate crisis. On top of burning through a lot of energy, they leak HFCs that are hundreds to thousands of times more powerful greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. Luckily, there are &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas/alternatives_en"&gt;alternative&lt;/a&gt; refrigerants that don’t raise global temperatures as much. The new EPA regulations are expected to prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking one out of every seven registered vehicles off the road in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="woNvYi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the most significant environmental policy laws passed in recent years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kf9iV6"&gt;Phasing down of HFCs and manufacturing alternatives will create “hundreds of thousands” more jobs, according to Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), who introduced the measure to regulate the refrigerants last year. One alternative, hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs, have already started to replace HFCs in car air conditioning and don’t heat up the planet nearly as much as HFCs. The EPA also expects its new HFC rules to save $284 billion in damages from climate-related disasters and health effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apaiOo"&gt;The move to phase down HFCs in the US is “one of the most significant environmental policy laws passed in recent years,” Karen Meyers, vice president of the Rheem Manufacturing Company (which makes air conditioners and other cooling and heating equipment), said in a &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-moves-forward-phase-down-climate-damaging-hydrofluorocarbons"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The EPA opened up a 45-day comment period on its proposed rule and plans to finalize it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNTu0x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s grocery delivery is getting a boost from new partnership with Gopuff</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjchZd"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-and-Gopuff-Partner-to-Bring-Everyday-Essentials-to-Uber-Eats/default.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was teaming up with delivery startup Gopuff to expand its delivery business. Gopuff, which acquired liquor store chain BevMo last year, will make its inventory of convenience and grocery store items available to Uber as part of this new deal. The companies plan to roll out their new offerings to customers in 95 cities starting this June and nationwide later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIFyjA"&gt;Gopuff will handle the logistics and delivery of the items, with Uber taking a cut of the transaction through its app. Gopuff, which was founded in 2013, operates in 650 cities in the US, with over 250 “micro-fulfillment centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjeWUT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber is slowly transforming into a delivery company &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lcXueB"&gt;The news follows months of Uber slowly transforming into a delivery company after suffering steep financial losses as a result of the pandemic. The company’s ride-hailing business tanked in the early days of 2020, and while it is still slowly recovering, it’s an open question as to whether it will return to its pre-pandemic heights. Uber said it completed &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;nearly 30 percent fewer trips&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as compared to the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AfzN0"&gt;Delivery was a bright spot for Uber, but while its Uber Eats takeout business is well-established, its grocery delivery has still yet to be fully realized. Only 100 cities, including 20 major metros, are eligible to have their groceries delivered by Uber. The company has made a number of acquisitions in recent months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;Cornershop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt;, as it seeks to expand its delivery options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6UmLQ"&gt;Still, Uber will have its work cut out for it as it seeks to compete with major players in the grocery delivery space, including Amazon and Instacart. Gopuff is an interesting choice for a partner. The company nearly tripled its revenue last year to $340 million as the pandemic forced more people to turn to delivery startups for essential items. But like Uber, the company has struggled to attract and retain drivers, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fgopuff-revenue-triples-but-growing-competition-to-test-expansion&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419461%2Fuber-gopuff-grocery-delivery-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Royal Navy is testing using jet suits to fight high-seas piracy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IhxgtnyA7utTdC_L3QlAtPXP9vc=/469x0:4060x2394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235738/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_10.00.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdYlg0"&gt;The British Royal Navy has apparently been testing using jet suits to board ships like a scene out of some scrapped Christopher Nolan film, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHOLFhbwsM"&gt;according to a new video&lt;/a&gt; released by UK-based Gravity Industries. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-royal-marines-board-ship-at-sea-with-jet-packs-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that the tests were conducted over three days on the HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy Batch 2 River-class offshore patrol ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEA3KD"&gt;Royal Marines used Gravity Industries’ Jet Suit to conduct a “visit, board, search, and seizure” operation or VBSS. Basically a marine launched from a fast boat tailing the HMS Tamar, flew through the air like a slightly askew Iron Man, and landed on the larger ship, dropping a rope below so their fast boat buddies could climb up and “visit” the simulated enemy vessel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PnotiW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suHOLFhbwsM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xIoy3M"&gt;The whole thing is very cool, to the point of almost seeming like a wire-assisted fake, and likely as much an ad for the Royal Navy and Gravity Industries as it is an actual test of the Gravity Jet Suit’s utility in a naval exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvZjoL"&gt;If the suit or its creators sound familiar, it’s because the company has been demonstrating its Iron Man tech for a while now, though in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16018410/sdcc-2017-best-of-marvel-stranger-things-favorites"&gt;Gravity Industries CEO Richard Browning has been in the pilot seat&lt;/a&gt; (or suit, in this case). This also isn’t the first time the Royal Navy has helped demo the tech. In 2019, Browning flew an earlier version of the Jet Suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189636/gravity-industries-richard-browning-jet-suit-royal-marines-assault-course-watch"&gt;through the Royal Navy’s assault course&lt;/a&gt;. Gravity Industries has also collaborated with the Dutch Maritime Special Operations Force (SOF) to put the suit through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzmFt6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2KvlQKdBo8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Dov2q"&gt;The suit seems to have been streamlined since these earlier demonstrations, featuring smaller arm rockets and a sleeker backpack jet more fitting for whatever sci-fi movie vibe Gravity Industries seems to be cultivating. What is sort of disappointing is mostly finding military applications of this technology when there are clearly plenty of other uses. Luckily, Gravity Industries has us covered there, too: the company has tested using the Jet Suit with the &lt;a href="https://www.greatnorthairambulance.co.uk/"&gt;Great North Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, a UK charity that rescues people from mountain ranges and a variety of other emergency scenarios in Northern England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4cWsaS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtvCnZqZnxc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHKQkK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushed Xbox chief to open free multiplayer just ahead of Apple Fortnite battle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sDLwcoLMB_7QFqiZIOUbrIURjFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235612/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2736R"&gt;Epic pushed Microsoft to open up its Xbox network for free multiplayer gaming just weeks before the Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; battle. In the weeks leading up to Epic Games’ decision to circumvent Apple’s 30 percent cut on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases, CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Xbox chief Phil Spencer teasing something big and asking whether Microsoft could time free multiplayer with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ78ST"&gt;“Epic has certain plans for August that will provide an extraordinary opportunity to highlight the value proposition of consoles and PCs, in contrast to mobile platforms, and to onboard new console users,” said Sweeney. “While I can’t share details with any third party at this point, I give you Epic’s assurance that our efforts will be positive and supportive of Microsoft, Xbox and Windows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dt6vpQO2R3YJYh1BSSb9Gqd55uw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491332/t9cDsT9.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic’s email to Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TOgHmyTmsIoAMFZPidkJm25nt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491333/d2jwCbS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s response to Epic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vMFokR"&gt;Sweeney also asked Spencer whether free Xbox Live multiplayer was coming, and whether Microsoft could time it to support &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14, the season Epic Games launched its alternate payment method that got &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; kicked off the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNT7vF"&gt;Spencer replied that “we will get there and I want to partner with you,” and that pushing these policies was “at the highest levels” at Microsoft, but implied Xbox Live wasn’t ready to go free multiplayer just yet. “Totally understood!” said Sweeney in response. “I gather there’s a lot going on at Microsoft nowadays. Anyway, you’ll enjoy the upcoming fireworks show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsjUX1"&gt;The timing of the email is provocative, given the events that followed. Had Spencer gone along with the plan, it seems likely that Xbox could have opened up Fortnite to non-Gold subscribers at the same time that Apple was shutting out the game entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv0JeY"&gt;The fireworks show that Sweeney promised certainly kicked off when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; season 14 launched, and it has since resulted in Epic Games taking Apple to court in a trial that’s ongoing. Microsoft did eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395433/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-free-multiplayer-games-party-chat"&gt;unlock Xbox Live free-to-play multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; last month, but it wasn’t as simple as Epic Games had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gi3eW"&gt;Microsoft’s removal of the Xbox Live Gold requirement came after the company was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;reverse a price hike&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Live Gold subscriptions earlier this year. Microsoft had attempted to double the cost of a yearly Xbox Live Gold subscription, a move that backfired. Microsoft quickly reversed the decision and offered to remove the paywall for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WNBA to stream games on Twitter, Facebook, and Paramount Plus</title>

  &lt;p id="7y40tf"&gt;For its upcoming 25th season, the Women’s National Basketball Association will broadcast games on Twitter, Facebook Watch, Oculus, and the &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1059515/3065?subId1=VergeWNBA050421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; streaming platform, &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-announces-broadcast-and-streaming-schedule-for-leagues-25th-regular-season/"&gt;the league announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlitGW"&gt;Twelve games will air on Twitter, and tweets from fans will be included as part of the broadcast. Facebook will stream 20 WNBA games on its Watch platform and its Oculus Quest and Quest 2 VR headsets, and three games will be shown on Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m9foU"&gt;ESPN’s platforms will show 25 regular-season games, three on ESPN, 12 games on ESPN2, and nine games on ABC. The WNBA’s All Star Game will also air on ESPN, and ESPN networks will cover 19 post-season games during the playoffs. All regular-season and post-season games that air on ESPN will also stream live on the ESPN app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Gp1yS"&gt;The league also announced a new partnership with Google, which is joining Deloitte, Nike, and AT&amp;amp;T as a WNBA “Changemaker.” Google chief marketing officer Lorraine Twohill said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/wnba-espn-partnership/"&gt;in a blog post announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt; that the company will be the presenting partner for the games airing on ESPN and ABC, and it will serve as a technology partner to the league. Twohill said Google is also working with ESPN to add a dedicated segment on women’s sports for its SportsCenter show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OugckP"&gt;Google is also working with &lt;a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2020/09/espn-films-producing-documentary-project-on-maya-moore/"&gt;ESPN on a &lt;em&gt;30 for 30&lt;/em&gt; documentary&lt;/a&gt; focused on four-time WNBA champion Maya Moore, who took a sabbatical from the Minnesota Lynx to push for criminal justice reform. &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/wnba/2020/9/16/21439514/maya-moore-married-jonathan-irons-wnba"&gt;Moore was instrumental in overturning&lt;/a&gt; the wrongful conviction of her now-husband Jonathan Irons, who was facing 50 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxbQfG"&gt;The new WNBA season kicks off May 14th. The full schedule of regular season games &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/schedule/"&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of Samsung’s best phones ever is now officially retired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus rear view" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dDkt6Hi-KKqo3wFzuqknvwMqMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69235494/jbareham_170414_1603_0044.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After four years of support, the S8 and S8 Plus will no longer receive security updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CVLJg"&gt;Four years after its launch, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has received its last security update. The Galaxy S8 was a well-timed success story for Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15092590/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-screen-size-aspect-ratio-edge"&gt;launching in the spring of 2017&lt;/a&gt; with a bold design that drew attention away from the well-documented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 battery problems&lt;/a&gt; of the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjJvyk"&gt;The S8 marked a design shift for Galaxy devices, with a wider-aspect edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezels that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications"&gt;one of the best-looking phones&lt;/a&gt; we’d seen at that point. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;wasn’t just a good-looking device, either&lt;/a&gt;; it offered excellent hardware and a great camera, combined with a remarkably restrained software implementation. Best of all, the batteries did not catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DuyWyZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has one of the best support policies in the industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5X9xL1"&gt;Samsung recently introduced a formal policy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;providing Galaxy devices with four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, including both S-series flagships and even budget-oriented A-series models. Premium devices tend to get monthly updates, at least for the first couple of years, with the cadence slowing down to quarterly or biannual updates toward end of life. It’s one of the best support policies in the industry — certainly for Android, and roughly on par with Apple’s typically lengthy device support schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGe1su"&gt;While the S8 and S8 Plus have reached the end of that support period, the S8 Active is still &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;on the schedule&lt;/a&gt; for quarterly updates and the S8 Lite is on the biannual schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
