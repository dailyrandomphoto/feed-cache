    <title>China passes new privacy law aimed at protecting users’ personal data</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hcOkeU"&gt;China has passed a new privacy law aimed at protecting users’ personal data, state media &lt;a href="http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/08/20/ARTIwr19ckRZu9Bhobw4k5wp210820.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The new law comes as Chinese tech firms have come under renewed scrutiny in the country, and sets rules around how companies handle users’ information. The law takes effect on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGNemt"&gt;The law—formally called the Personal Information Protection Law— was passed by China’s legislature on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, and calls for companies to get users’ consent before collecting personal data, and has rules for how companies should ensure users’ data is protected when it’s transferred outside of China. Tech companies that handle personal information must have a designated person tasked with overseeing its protection, and companies must conduct regular audits to be sure they’re complying with the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET5Bvf"&gt;In addition, companies handling personal user data have to have clear and reasonable purpose for doing so, and must limit it to the “minimum scope necessary to achieve the goals” of handling said data, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rLjQu"&gt;In an op-ed in the Chinese state media outlet People’s Court Daily, the National People’s Congress lauded the new legislation, &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NupbI"&gt;“Personalization is the result of a user’s choice, and true personalized recommendations must ensure the user’s freedom to choose, without compulsion,” the op-ed piece read. “Therefore, users must be given the right to not make use of personalized recommendation functions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse removed personal info from users’ accounts in Afghanistan as a safety measure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBTR5hvEEJNWLHkXV3vaCZzMjhE=/548x0:3548x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69757451/clubhouse_graphic.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clubhouse has removed some info from users in Afghanistan as a safety measure | Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fE9RP"&gt;Social audio app Clubhouse has joined other social platforms in taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of its users in Afghanistan. Earlier this week, the platform reset tens of thousands of its Afghan users’ bios and photos, and made their accounts more difficult to discover in search. A spokesperson for Clubhouse said the actions didn’t affect the users’ followers, and all of the changes can be reversed if a user prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wHI3A7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A message form &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Afghanistan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;’s users. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CpS4iz0L1J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CpS4iz0L1J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaki Daryabi (@ZDaryabi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZDaryabi/status/1428233850296184836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYjbVF"&gt;Clubhouse has also been reminding its Afghan users that it does allow pseudonyms for human rights or safety purposes. The company consulted with free expression and violent extremism experts to help craft its approach, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRsJfd"&gt;As the Taliban have regained control of the country,  many &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/taliban-violence-drives-afghans-wipe-social-media-profiles-rcna1731"&gt;people in Afghanistan have tried to delete photos&lt;/a&gt; from their social media accounts and phones that could show a connection to the West, or the former Afghan government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvEbcs"&gt;And despite bans on many social platforms, the Taliban has been able to push its messaging on social media, becoming as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/18/taliban-social-media-success/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote, sophisticated at social media tactics in an attempt to change its image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35Fx2I"&gt;On Thursday, Facebook said it had added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474000611573762?s=20"&gt;security measures for users in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, including hiding “friends” lists and adding a tool to quickly lock down accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEjH2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge rules California Prop 22 gig workers law is unconstitutional</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="App-based drivers from Uber and Lyft protest in a caravan in front of City Hall in Los Angeles on October 22, 2020 where elected leaders hold a conference urging voters to reject on the November 3 election, Proposition 22, that would classify app-based drivers as independent contractors and not employees or agents" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KVUW0SAtiJlqu_PjrEb68tXysc=/396x0:4404x2672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69756985/1229223235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Drivers held a protest against Prop 22 in October. The measure passed in November, however. | Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awPxLG"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which allows companies like Uber and Lyft to treat workers as independent contractors— not employees— has been ruled unconstitutional and unenforceable by a judge. Voters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;approved the law as ballot initiative Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; in November, with companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash spending more than $200 million to campaign for the measure. Labor organizations, including the Service Employees International Union, opposed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4QeG9"&gt;California Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled Friday that the law illegally “limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law,” adding that “The entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable.” He also ruled that it was unconstitutional to that the law required any future amendments to have a seven-eighths vote of approval to pass the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8dvV9"&gt;In January, a group of Uber and Lyft drivers, along with the SEIU, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227042/uber-lyft-prop-22-lawsuit-overturn-drivers-california"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; seeking to have the measure overturned. The law exempts gig employers from providing benefits and protections to workers, but requires that they offer healthcare subsidies and minimum hourly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iK2jnN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8UxWYr"&gt;Roesch took issue with the part of the law that requires any future California state law concerning collective bargaining for gig workers to comply with the Prop 22 law. “It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies in having a divided, ununionized workforce, which is not a stated goal of the legislation,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTi0rp"&gt;Geoff Vetter, a spokesperson for the Protect App-Based Drivers &amp;amp; Services &lt;a href="https://protectdriversandservices.com/about/our-coalition/"&gt;Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (PADS), which includes Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they plan to appeal. The judge “made a serious error by ignoring a century’s worth of case law requiring the courts to guard the voters’ right of initiative,” Vetter wrote, noting that a majority of California voters had approved the measure. “All of the provisions of Prop 22 will remain in effect until the appeal process is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $75 off at Amazon and Walmart today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There’s a new “artist” watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WlKaRYOICMCEw8jZdmFYJmXSaA4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69756933/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This weekend, it’s not just the red Apple Watch Series 6 getting a discount. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LV8f67"&gt;The red Apple Watch Series 6 has already seen an array of big discounts, but you don’t always get nice pricing on the more subtle colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering $75 off the handsome navy-colored watch, as well as the white model, bringing them down to $325. Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown. In addition to a myriad of fun colors, Apple’s latest and greatest wearable also offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qigDsv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Eaty"&gt;Amazon and Google may be paving the way toward a smarter home, but not every device under the sun touts smart capabilities yet. Luckily, there are devices like TP-Link’s Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini. The simple, voice-enabled device works with virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as IFTTT, giving you an easy way to control your plugs via Wi-Fi and set a schedule. Normally $18, you can grab TP-Link’s compact smart plug at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749634942986522554" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftp-link-wifi-mini-smart%2F-%2FA-52107189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YUqPyP"&gt;If you own a PlayStation 4 or the PlayStation 5, a subscription to PlayStation Plus is really a no-brainer. The premium service grants you access to online multiplayer, free monthly titles, and 100GB of cloud storage, along with exclusive deals on select games, add-ons, and preorders. It also lets you take advantage of the PlayStation Plus collection, a catalog that contains some of the best PlayStation games to date, including hits such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/3/8339241/bloodborne-is-a-blood-soaked-bone-splintering-masterpiece-on-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Best of all, if you’re a new subscriber, you can land a 12-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/IP9101-NPIA90005_01-PSPLUSDIS50OFF1Y/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus for just $30&lt;/a&gt; through August 30th, half off what it would typically cost for Sony’s landmark service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4jXiS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClAtmV"&gt;We’ve been tracking this deal on the AirPods Pro — the best one since Black Friday — for a few days now. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are still offering $70 off a new set of the popular noise-canceling earbuds, bringing the final sale price down to $180. Not only are the true wireless earbuds built around the Apple-designed H1 chip, which gives them always-on support for Siri, but they feature great noise cancellation and deep integration with iOS, adding to their convenience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zFkH7N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juoMF5"&gt;To celebrate &lt;em&gt;Quake’s&lt;/em&gt; 25th anniversary and the game’s wider release on consoles, Steam is offering big discounts on many great games as part of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/bethesda/sale/quakecon2021?snr=1_4_4__118" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QuakeCon sale&lt;/a&gt;. You can currently take your pick from a plethora of solid titles, including entries from the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Dishonored franchises, though, personally, we recommend the modern Doom titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yevur5"&gt;The widely beloved &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 2016 title responsible for ripping and tearing the classic franchise back from the brink of potential obscurity, is just $5 (50 percent off). Last year’s sequel, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $15 (75 percent off), and even &lt;em&gt;Eternal’s&lt;/em&gt; two DLC expansions, &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Gods&lt;/em&gt; Parts &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098292/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_One/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098293/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_Two/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, are 50 percent off or available together for $15 as the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098291/DOOM_Eternal_Year_One_Pass/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Year One Pass&lt;/a&gt;. That is a ton of collective hours of fast-action, FPS chaos for cheap. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Eternal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s app indicates a rowing machine may finally be coming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bAM8Zz"&gt;Peloton’s rumored rowing machine may finally be on the way, according to text that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/20/peloton-app-confirms-rower-prepares-scenic-waterways/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; discovered in the Peloton Android app&lt;/a&gt;. When looking through the app’s code, &lt;em&gt;9to5 &lt;/em&gt;discovered references to the rowing machine we’ve been hearing about for the past couple of years — including instructions on how to do a rowing stroke, as well as language suggesting Peloton will offer real-world water scenery that people could view on a screen while rowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFX2M3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/peloton-to-sell-cheaper-treadmill-and-a-rowing-machine-in-2020?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;wrote about plans for a Peloton rower&lt;/a&gt; nearly two and a half years ago. More recently, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-rower-job-posting/"&gt;job listings&lt;/a&gt; mentioning a rower, and Peloton’s CEO has made multiple comments &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-john-foley-rower-strength-bloomberg/"&gt;about rowers&lt;/a&gt; and rowing. If information about the rower is starting to show up in the app’s code, though, it may signal that the machine is already in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLTTM7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found two potential code names for the project: “Mazu” and “Caesar” (&lt;em&gt;9to5 &lt;/em&gt;had to be clever to find the names, as they were scrambled using a cypher). Mazu is one of the names of a legendary Chinese water deity, which fits with the idea that the product is a rower. It’s also a name that’s &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/apple-watch-gymkit-integration-product-code-names-bike-titan-tread-prism-rower-mazu/"&gt;shown up in Peloton’s code before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DBhLHd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It makes sense that Peloton would want to compete with machines being called “the Peloton of rowers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HaGhm8"&gt;Peloton won’t be the first to get to the smart-rower market, however — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/tmrw/i-tried-peloton-rowing-it-earned-its-reputation-t214266"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/hydrow-rower-review"&gt;already produced machines&lt;/a&gt; that some reviewers have called “the Peloton of rowers,” one of which was even released in 2019, months before &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;revealed Peloton might have one as well. Still, it makes sense that the actual Peloton would want a piece of that market. It could also give another class of athletes an entry point into the Peloton ecosystem, which might help the company gain more subscribers for its memberships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFkwRB"&gt;Recent months haven’t been kind to Peloton — it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627383/peloton-tread-recall-update-repair-fix-screen"&gt;working to make its treadmills safer&lt;/a&gt;, after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;issued a recall for the machines&lt;/a&gt; due to a string of injuries and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;tragic death of a child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khu85a"&gt;When asked for comment about &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, Peloton responded “while our R&amp;amp;D team is always working on new ideas, we have no new products to announce at this time.” There have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545560/peloton-wearble-heart-rate-monitor-fitness"&gt;recently been rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on another new hardware product: an armband to monitor your heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has already discontinued the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFKZY6bXeGT0HV_l6DYodE_VOts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755977/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 (top) and 4A 5G (bottom) will likely sell out soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNmf8"&gt;Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;news of a new Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; this week, Google quietly indicated that it’s the end of the road for two other Pixel devices: the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 5. Both are currently listed on Google’s online store as sold out, and remaining stock at other retailers likely won’t last long. A company spokesperson offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aijLY1"&gt;With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G). These products will continue to be available through some partners while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4hZ6"&gt;It’s not too surprising that the 4A 5G being discontinued given that the 5A 5G looks to be a fairly direct successor. However, it is a little unusual to see the Pixel 5 discontinued well in advance of the Pixel 6’s arrival this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLLT"&gt;Maybe that’s because the Pixel 5 bears more of a similarity to the budget-oriented A-series phones than it will to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google appears to be pulling out all the stops for the 6-series, positioning them as true flagship competitors to Apple and Samsung’s heavy hitters. While the Pixel 5 offers step-up features like wireless charging and robust IP68 waterproofing not available in the A-series, it wasn’t quite specced out to compete with the iPhone 12 Pros and Galaxy S21s of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dtg2K6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gv7Azf"&gt;Or maybe this is just how Google does things now — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;stopped selling the Pixel 4 and 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after their introduction. But on the bright side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;the LTE-only Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still on sale for now, and it’s a steal for its $349 price tag. You’ll just need to like baby blue... er, &lt;em&gt;barely blue&lt;/em&gt;, since the “just black” model is sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook suppressed report that made it look bad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9FWXI1kITJeifpLLl1M12W8Ab4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755807/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V13Di4"&gt;On Wednesday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; about what content was most viewed by people in the US last quarter. It was the first time it had released such a report. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook was working on a similar report for the first quarter of 2021 that it opted not to share because it might have reflected poorly on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYUyXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which obtained a copy of the report, says that the most-viewed link in the first quarter had a headline that could promote COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330428/facebook-research-vaccine-hesitancy-doubt-coronavirus"&gt;been an issue on the social media platform&lt;/a&gt;. The headline read, “A ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why.” The article was published by &lt;em&gt;The South Florida Sun Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; and republished by &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlnMWp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Executives feared it could be a public relations issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdOyEp"&gt;Facebook was working on releasing this report, but executives, including Alex Schultz, Facebook’s CMO and VP of analytics, apparently “debated whether it would cause a public relations problem, according to the internal emails” and ultimately decided not to publish it, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mgn0u9"&gt;“We considered making the report public earlier but since we knew the attention it would garner, exactly as we saw this week, there were fixes to the system we wanted to make,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement. Stone also clarified Schultz’s opinion on if Facebook should release the report, saying that Schultz “advocated for putting out the report.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEYVkp"&gt;It’s been a busy week for Facebook. In addition to publishing the report about the top-viewed posts, it has also had to contend with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22627032/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-complaint-monopoly-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qMqmE7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook releases a report on the most-viewed content in News Feed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"},{"title":"FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22627032/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-complaint-monopoly-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans shares its new policy banning sexually explicit content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4J_yBcxRxOru_E9pDP4eIT3iHBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755572/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEuVCT"&gt;On Thursday the video and image sharing site OnlyFans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;announced plans to ban “sexually-explicit content”&lt;/a&gt; starting October 1st. While we’re still not sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;exactly why&lt;/a&gt; it’s changing so drastically, it just sent out an updated Terms of Service policy to the creators who’ve built the site detailing exactly what won’t be allowed going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olv5aF"&gt;Comparing &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/aup"&gt;the new OnlyFans Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms#acceptable-use-policy"&gt;the old one&lt;/a&gt; makes the additions clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldp61G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not upload, post, display, or publish Content on OnlyFans that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uQlMlr"&gt;Shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct”, which means:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WdnGw0"&gt;actual or simulated sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, between persons of any sex;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyQkWo"&gt;actual or simulated masturbation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5JghHn"&gt;any exhibition of the anus or genitals of any person which is extreme or offensive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qVoqtP"&gt;actual or simulated material depicting bodily fluids commonly secreted during sexual conduct;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RvKYs8"&gt;All existing Content that shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct” (which has the meaning given to it in section 5(b) of this Policy) must be removed before December 1, 2021, or by any other date which we communicate to Users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R2BTyO"&gt;Other sections of the policy that ban deepfakes, drugs, or violence, remain unchanged. In an email to OnlyFans creators, the site specified that “Content containing nudity will continue to be allowed as long as it is consistent with the policy.” Posts can show off body parts, but doing anything explicit (or zooming in too close) means they will be in violation. Any breach “may lead to your account being suspended or terminated, and access to your earnings being revoked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2vQWc"&gt;OnlyFans has largely built its billion-dollar business and brand on sex workers providing exactly the kind of content that’s being banned. Now those content creators have until December 1st to wipe any traces of the suddenly unacceptable content from their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance to attempt second Mars soil scoop, hoping rocks don’t ‘crumble’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcLnp0uMv2ii2W91r3ydGMKA1AE=/0x29:1280x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755428/26115_NavCam_Left_LF_0164_0681506334_116CWS_N0060000NCAM00315_0A00LLJ01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo showing the hole drilled during Perseverance’s first sample collection attempt, that left the rover’s sample tube empty. | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dpGLWZ"&gt;NASA’s Mars rover, Perseverance, is getting ready for another attempt, in the coming weeks, to scoop up Martian rocks after its first attempt earlier this month didn’t play out as engineers expected. The rover’s sample-caching arm worked, engineers say, but the sampling tube turned up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdRc2b"&gt;Now the rover, a science lab on wheels that landed on Mars in February, will drive to a new location called Citadelle for a second shot at picking up its first rock sample. This time, to make sure a sample is actually collected, engineers will wait for images of the sample tube to come back before it gets processed and stowed inside the rover’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzpnPc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DeFyBB"&gt;“We were just super excited that the hardware worked from beginning to end without any faults. And then there was that surprise — ‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’,” Louise Jandura, the Chief Engineer for Sampling &amp;amp; Caching on NASA’s Perseverance team, says of the first attempt on August 5th. “So quickly, after that sunk in, we started to do the investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr746o"&gt;The rock that Perseverance’s sampling drill bit dug into wasn’t as sturdy as scientists thought it’d be. What was supposed to be a fairly solid rock core turned out to be a crumbly powder that slipped out of the rover’s sampling tube. After finding the sample tube was empty, mission staff used the rover’s cameras to analyze remnants of the hole that Perseverance drilled. They figured the mound of dust around the hole and some material at the bottom of the hole were what slipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGUBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10711752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFhuu"&gt;“The rock simply wasn’t our kind of rock,” Jennifer Trosper, Project Manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Although we had successfully acquired over 100 cores in a range of different test rocks on Earth, we had not encountered a rock in our test suite that behaved in quite this manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qOvkK"&gt;Perseverance’s seven-foot, five-jointed sampling arm reaches out from the front of the rover toward a rock of interest with a large shoe box-sized head, or turret, on the end that weighs 100 pounds. That head packs a hollow drill bit, formally called a &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25565/rotary-percussive-corer-drill/"&gt;Rotary Percussive Corer Drill&lt;/a&gt;, that drills into the rock and traps material inside a tube, which gets stowed back into the rover and processed inside another tube until it’s ready to get left somewhere on the Martian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRhAY0"&gt;The drill bit used for Perseverance’s first sampling attempt is for collecting rock cores. Some of the rover’s 9 drill bits are better suited for collecting regolith — the more crumbly, dirt-like material that engineers accidentally encountered during the first sampling attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4cdQmktesLoKSKzW6ls5W0T3_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22796020/Aug_20_2021_17_07_53.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvHkpa"&gt;Perseverance’s mission to collect up to 35 samples of Martian rocks is the first leg of a three-pronged endeavor to return those samples back to Earth sometime in the 2030s. The rocks, stowed inside tiny chalk-sized sample tubes, would represent the first pristine Mars samplings ever captured and returned to Earth by humans. Perseverance will leave the tubes somewhere on the Martian surface for a future NASA robot to collect and launch into Mars’ orbit, where another spacecraft built by the European Space Agency will catch and carry it the rest of the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDtSL"&gt;NASA engineers spent nearly a decade designing and building the rover’s sampling system, which Perseverance’s chief engineer Adam Steltzner has described as “the most complicated, most sophisticated thing that we know how to build.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdeYj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on the tiny details that make game development so hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_81k_pKy_JQd7_NZqRx3mPS-Wh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755412/vpavic_180607_2652_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRHSzi"&gt;While many video games might feel nearly effortless to play, letting you make impossible jumps, drive cars at breakneck speeds, cast magic out of thin air, and so much more, actually &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; those games is a superhuman feat of its own. Just one game often requires the efforts of a huge team laboriously crafting every minute detail, and very little of it that comes easy, as detailed by numerous developers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; Rebekah Valentine in &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;this article that you should read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AqQzN"&gt;Valentine’s article has a lot of fascinating stories from developers answering this question: “What is a thing in video games that seems simple but is actually extremely hard for game developers to make?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws3n1j"&gt;Take elevators, for example, which, in a video game, aren’t just a moving platform behind doors. &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; lead level designer Bill Gardner described the potential problems of just trying to get inside one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1YlbrY"&gt;First off, you have to summon [an elevator] via a button or whatever. By calling the elevator, you open the opportunity for the player, objects, or AI to wander underneath it and get squished or trapped. So suddenly you have to deal with that. It’s an invitation to make your enemies or companions look dumb, for physics objects to go flying, or for quest items to get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o1nKCT"&gt;Or how about the act of responding to any player input? Here’s how Johnnemann Nordhagen, a developer at Dim Bulb Games, discusses it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="USqAwU"&gt;Something I’ve spent many hours on is player input. It seems simple — you press spacebar; you jump. But then you start to fall into all the special cases. What if the player is crouching? What if you want the spacebar to also activate items that the player is standing near? What about players using controllers instead of a keyboard? What about letting players remap their control scheme? What happens when the game is paused, or in a menu? What if, God help you, this is a networked game and you need to send that to a server? It turns into a system that requires multiple layers of abstraction to be able to handle all the possible things that might happen in a game when a player wants to jump, or presses the spacebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CdP82n"&gt;And developers in the article don’t just discuss the challenges of game mechanics; they also describe difficult aspects of things like storytelling and localization. Here’s just one really good anecdote, from JC Lau, a producer at Harebrained Schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GqABYb"&gt;When I worked at Xbox in localization, it was when the console rolled out its friends list feature and there was a little popup that said, ‘Socialize with your friends’ directing people to use the friends list. In Polish, that got translated to ‘Support socialism with your friends,’ which was thankfully caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pVyfFR"&gt;The whole article is packed with other interesting details and stories. Great games are easy to take for granted while playing them, but these developers’ tales are a good reminder that game development can be very hard. I highly recommend taking a few minutes out of your day to &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;go read Valentine’s story on &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
