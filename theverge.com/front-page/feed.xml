    <title>Twitch has ‘indefinitely’ banned Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdjP2z"&gt;Twitch has “indefinitely” banned former President Donald Trump from its platform. The action comes two weeks after the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;disabled Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;, preventing him from streaming but leaving the account page live, in light of the mob attack on the Capitol. At the time, a company spokesperson told a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter that it would reassess his account after he left office — which happened today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzNXWX"&gt;“We have indefinitely suspended President Trump’s Twitch channel due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence,” a Twitch spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="f055FH"&gt;The President’s statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public. Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions. However, the events of the past weeks have highlighted a gap with respect to rhetoric that encourages violence, regardless of whether or not it was directly streamed on Twitch. We will be updating our policies as a result of our consideration of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xXmV7c"&gt;This kind of suspension means that Trump will have &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/about-account-suspensions-dmca-suspensions-and-chat-bans?language=en_US"&gt;no opportunity to appeal the ban&lt;/a&gt; on his account, and it also means that he cannot create another account there unless his suspension is lifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQL2hw"&gt;Twitch’s action follows others taken by social media platforms like Twitter — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned Trump for inciting violence after the Capitol attack&lt;/a&gt; — though it is the first platform to take action against Trump since his term ended today. Twitch initially issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;a temporary ban&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s account in June 2020 for broadcasting “hateful conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhiteHouse.gov now has dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the White House website, showing the dark, high contrast mode activated." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKVZ56Tusr2DG23Nb-8RLmxd7XA=/53x0:2231x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695583/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.26.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpyu7d"&gt;The official website of the White House, &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, has been completely replaced with a new version for the Biden administration, and it comes with some unexpected accessibility features: a high contrast mode, which serves as a dark mode, and a toggle to make the font size larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fy08"&gt;Both options show up along the left rail as big, easy-to-click or tap buttons, and that’s the way you’ll need to toggle them. Even if your device has a system-wide dark mode, the White House website won’t switch over automatically. That’s because it’s really there to serve as an accessibility feature, meant to help anyone who would have trouble reading or looking at a bright white screen with black text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lszlCD"&gt;With dark mode being very popular among heavy computer users as well, people online were understandably excited to see the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="traket"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE WHITEHOUSE WEBSITE HAS DARK MODE I’M LOSING IT. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7kXlBhUXeJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7kXlBhUXeJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sara Ownbey Chipps (@SaraJChipps) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaraJChipps/status/1351942085952352260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiU2dn"&gt;The large text mode — no surprises — makes the text on the site significantly larger, while still preserving the layout, something that may not be true when using a browser’s built-in zoom ability. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The White House site showing with a dark background, large buttons and text" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/di7-VoZuqQ1ssqFH2UuGjSD49QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247885/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.31.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site in both high contrast and large text mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ0jUs"&gt;Acting as a recruiting tool for anyone who’s looking into the site’s code, the HTML header also makes a callout to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;the US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;. The group, led by a former Google engineer, is tasked with making sure US government websites are as good as any of the other ones we visit on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A zoomed-in screenshot showing the high-contrast and large font size toggle buttons" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edOHhO4Vr1p3JZreY9jzQExEOVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247932/bidens_buttons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are the buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TSQ7SU"&gt;While the previous &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt; site wasn’t a trainwreck by any means (at least technically speaking), it’s good to see that the new administration is taking accessibility and digital competency seriously from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pOyaoY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;US Digital Service is a really big deal to help rebuild the country &lt;a href="https://t.co/B527dWpDr1"&gt;https://t.co/B527dWpDr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— craig newmark (@craignewmark) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/craignewmark/status/1351939985474260997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bKiOBM"&gt;The site also has an addition to help with inclusivity — &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/"&gt;the “Contact Us” form&lt;/a&gt; now asks the user for their preferred pronouns. The change was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glaad/status/1351974350853967876"&gt;spotted by GLAAD&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully speaks to a trend with the current administration. Vice President Kamala Harris also includes her pronouns in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris"&gt;her personal Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt; (though they aren’t yet in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP"&gt;her @VP bio&lt;/a&gt;,) which is something that we haven’t yet seen from a president or vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dropdown menu on the White House contact page that allows the user to select their pronouns." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEikKW5TWFG9KgmCInMwoxXWjaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248366/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_12.04.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new pronoun menu on the contact page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u1NcxG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 3:28PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the website’s contact form now also allows the user to input their preferred pronouns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9l2ZV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 3:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Kamala Harris having her pronouns in her Twitter bio is a first for the office of the president or vice president.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today, the US welcomed a new president and new Bernie memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQvc69FeJ0LftAQefxGotvawJ3Y=/0x17:1096x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696431/EsMWA4aW4AIwkUE.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21cO1c"&gt;Today’s US presidential inauguration brought many good things, but the thing Twitter seems most excited about is a new crop of Bernie memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m7bZi"&gt;The meme started with a wire photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), sitting on a folding chair watching President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The temperature in Washington, DC was in the 40s, so he’s bundled up with a coat and mittens, and he’s sitting socially distanced from everyone else, as his age and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hospital.html"&gt;prior health issues&lt;/a&gt; put him at severe risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGEbbH"&gt;Something about Sanders’ chilly body language, his oversized wool mittens, and the fact that he was sitting entirely alone made the photo irresistible as meme material. Of course, the senator is no stranger to memes — including 2016’s Birdie Sanders and 2020’s “I am once again asking” — but this one has blown up particularly quickly. Take a look for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon offers to help Biden administration with vaccinations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuoNCGF2wk_IfHjm8sh0d3tZ8iU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696294/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtIIvD"&gt;Amazon has offered to help the Biden administration meet its goal of completing 100 million coronavirus vaccinations within the next 100 days. “Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s worldwide operations leader, wrote in a letter to the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvVhto"&gt;The company’s main interest appears to be in offering vaccinations through its own facilities. Clark writes that Amazon has “an agreement in place” with a health care provider to administer vaccinations on site, though he did not say which Amazon facilities were being considered. The company operates warehouses, Amazon-branded shops, and Whole Foods grocery stores. Clark said Amazon could “move quickly once vaccines are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ry93yR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObHdtT"&gt;Amazon could also provide technology and communications resources to help the new administration, Clark said. “We are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration’s vaccination efforts,” Clark wrote in the letter addressed to Biden. The letter was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/amazoncom-vaccine/amazon-offers-to-help-u-s-with-vaccine-in-letter-to-president-biden-idUSL1N2JV294"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TocQbE"&gt;Among the challenges of getting the US vaccinated is completing the “last mile” of distribution — getting the vaccines from distributors to patients. Pfizer and Moderna’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;vaccines need to be transported while frozen&lt;/a&gt;, with Pfizer’s requiring ultra-cold storage. Once they get to a facility, they need to be thawed and quickly distributed. Lately, distribution efforts in the US have been complicated by confusion over who’s eligible and fractured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;access to vaccine sign-ups and appointments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDUpnG"&gt;Amazon, of course, has one of the most expansive distribution systems in the United States, designed to rapidly ship packages from warehouses across the country. The offer marks a stark contrast to Amazon’s relationship with the previous administration, which was strained by former President Donald Trump’s ongoing grudge against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Trump also took a fairly hands-off approach to federal involvement in vaccine distribution, largely leaving states responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As parting message, Jim Bridenstine leaves Artemis program ‘in good shape’ for Biden’s NASA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70enVG2znkIet-J4NT4lvbWSJtw=/0x0:4855x3237/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68696201/33044625978_0f7c430472_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bill Ingalls / NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGV9Ig"&gt;At 12PM ET today, Jim Bridenstine officially stepped down from his role as NASA administrator. During his time at the agency, the former Oklahoma congressman and Naval aviator used his political chops to drum up bipartisan support for the Trump administration’s Artemis program, the agency’s cornerstone initiative to land humans on the Moon by 2024 — a deadline widely viewed as nearly impossible to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oobCp7"&gt;In anticipation of President Joe Biden taking office and the Senate transitioning to Democratic control, Bridenstine, a Republican, spent his final days as administrator making one last push for the Artemis program, a parting bid to insulate the program from potential cancellation. Last week, he met with top Democrats including Sen. Patrick Leahy, who’s expected to become the second-highest-ranking official in the Senate once Biden takes office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44Acur"&gt;“We have done everything we can to build the consensus necessary for this program to be long-term sustainable,” Bridenstine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview before heading out. “I think as hard as we’ve worked to build the consensus over the last three years, I think we’re in good shape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="96jPkc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think as hard as we’ve worked to build the consensus over the last three years, I think we’re in good shape.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISP6bD"&gt;The multibillion-dollar Artemis program will face a new administration focused on building consensus around other priorities, including battling the coronavirus pandemic and tackling climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZDjyp"&gt;Already, Congress has balked at the idea of a 2024 deadline for landing humans on the Moon: of the $3.3 billion NASA said it needed for next year’s budget to stay on track for 2024, Congress came up with $850 million. But Bridenstine still views that as a win: during a pandemic, NASA’s budget is billions more than what it was when he took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySH9Fo"&gt;The $850 million for NASA marks the first time Congress agreed to fund a human lunar lander since the Apollo program. “That’s notable,” Casey Dreier, senior space policy adviser at The Planetary Society, said in an interview. “It didn’t get that far during the constellation program, the last time we tried going to the Moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vztzzc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA “couldn’t successfully make the case to Congress as to why they needed the money now, and why they needed it for 2024”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3Bt8y"&gt;But it also shows NASA “couldn’t successfully make the case to Congress as to why they needed the money now, and why they needed it for 2024,” Dreier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoVL28"&gt;On Wednesday, Bridenstine tweeted a final message as administrator in an emotional three-minute video, emphasizing that “eliminating division” is key to enabling long-term success for Artemis and welcoming the next administrator who will inherit the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEd8CH"&gt;“With that I say farewell. And I’ll tell ya, when a new team comes in, give them all your support. Because they need it, they deserve it, and of course what we’re trying to do, we’re not only crossing multiple administrations, but multi-decade and multigenerational,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G8frhi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It has been my great honor to serve as your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASA&lt;/a&gt; Administrator. I will miss the amazing NASA family and will forever be grateful for my time at this incredible agency. Ad astra. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zba4MTawPV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zba4MTawPV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1351917625715130368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="itR4yK"&gt;Steve Jurczyk, NASA’s former number two under Bridenstine, assumed the role of acting administrator at noon once Biden was sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rylf3a"&gt;President Biden is expected to pick a woman to fill the NASA administrator role, which has only been occupied by men since the agency’s founding in 1958. His transition team for NASA, led by the director of the National Air and Space Museum, Ellen Stofan, has spent over a month reviewing the agency’s top programs and interviewing agency personnel, but it hasn’t released any hints on where Biden will officially stand on space policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JX3C6v"&gt;Bridenstine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he plans to take a job in his home state of Oklahoma but declined to specify what that job will be. Asked if he’s running for office again, he said “Oh, no no no. No. I’ll tell ya, I have no desire to run for office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiDo11"&gt;“They say never say never, but it would take something significant to get me back into politics. I’ve never been so happy to not be in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhQqN6"&gt;In the Twitter video, where he choked up thanking NASA employees, Bridenstine ended with a simple message: “Go get ‘em. Go NASA. Ad astra.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen boss joins Twitter with a jab at Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New President Of SEAT Is Presented In Barcelona" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l0P8mq5rtDd-nZEsLfAoxLTlt94=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695981/1275822696.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Miquel Benitez/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIQ22k"&gt;Volkswagen Group boss Herbert Diess joined twitter Wednesday, and his first tweet was a light trolling of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF6FrF"&gt;“Hello @Twitter! I’m here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues,” Diess &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1351915219094806529"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzHbwf"&gt;Diess — who last year settled criminal charges related to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200520-volkswagen-bosses-avoid-trial-over-dieselgate-scandal-with-9-mn-euro-settlement"&gt;his role in the Dieselgate emissions scandal&lt;/a&gt; — was referencing how the first mass-market electric vehicles of its VW and Audi brands performed well in Europe (and &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/german-electric-car-sales-triple-2020"&gt;especially in Germany&lt;/a&gt;) in their debut year, causing Tesla to lose market share on the continent. (To wit, while writing this, Tesla &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/20/tesla-drops-model-3-prices-in-europe/"&gt;dropped prices on the Model 3&lt;/a&gt; in Europe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O0ot70"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! I’m here to make an impact with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VWGroup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VWGroup&lt;/a&gt;, especially on political issues. And, of course, to get some of your market shares, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!&lt;/p&gt;— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1351915219094806529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQiphG"&gt;Most automotive and other big-brand CEOs use Twitter in an obligatory manner. They issue stately comments on new products or initiatives but are otherwise absent from the daily churn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTnEZr"&gt;It’s hard to imagine Diess — who &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/tesla-is-paving-the-way-and-we-appreciate-that-vw-ceo-says.html"&gt;has praised Musk in the past&lt;/a&gt; — doing much else beyond tweeting playful jabs like the one on Wednesday, let alone actually engaging Musk on his terms with memes and snark and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244136/elon-musk-tesla-stock-price-too-high-fall-tweet"&gt;stock price-moving jokes&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, Diess &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-volkswagens-50-billion-plan-to-beat-tesla-short-circuited-11611073974"&gt;just barely survived&lt;/a&gt; a major power struggle that played out inside the Volkswagen Group. While he remains the top boss, he was stripped of his title of CEO of the VW brand in large part because of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;major software problems&lt;/a&gt; the ID 3 has had during its rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctIsg6"&gt;Stranger things have happened, but the idea that Diess — who apparently once made his executives attend a “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-volkswagens-50-billion-plan-to-beat-tesla-short-circuited-11611073974"&gt;syntegration workshop&lt;/a&gt;” — would break edgelord seems unlikely. Musk, meanwhile, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;spent nearly two years possibly violating a court order&lt;/a&gt; that says he’s supposed to have tweets about Tesla pre-screened by a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb0jMV"&gt;To Musk’s credit, he also spends a lot of his time on Twitter responding to customers who have suggestions or complaints about Tesla’s products. In fact, this has become such a critical pipeline that Tesla’s energy division has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-job-hiring-customer-service-specialist-help-twitter-elon-musk-2021-1"&gt;hiring customer service specialists&lt;/a&gt; who now help field those requests. If Diess learns any lessons about how to use Twitter from Musk, that may be a good place to start given the state of the ID 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Twitter made Joe Biden’s @POTUS account start with zero followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President-Elect Biden Announces Climate And Energy Appointments" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j0dv15QIpD4QXNU2d20VAqEFrk=/0x0:4461x2974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568163/1230220167.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22XJ2G"&gt;President Biden is going to need some Twitter followers. Twitter wiped out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts once Biden was sworn in, today, January 20th, rather than transferring the accounts’ existing followers over to the new administration. That’s what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Flaherty/status/1341406581901189120"&gt;what Rob Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, Biden’s digital director, said would happen in late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVImpc"&gt;Here’s the full list of changes today, according to Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EszzjG"&gt;Trump administration Twitter accounts are now publicly archived and include: @POTUS45, @WhiteHouse45, @VP45, @PressSec45, @FLOTUS45 and @SecondLady45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOGeo9"&gt;Accounts for the White House, President, Vice President, First Lady and White House Press Secretary have now inherited their new institutional usernames:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rFWCo"&gt;@Transition46 has become @WhiteHouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npleHr"&gt;@PresElectBiden has become @POTUS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JPcjU"&gt;@SenKamalaHarris has become @VP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSYLkJ"&gt;@FLOTUSBiden has become @FLOTUS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBDOQn"&gt;@PressSecPsaki has become @PressSec&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSL36h"&gt;A new account, @SecondGentleman, is also live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0UV7uusJShqRVlRsG7zbR-I_Cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247821/chrome_OUvfJZd9r4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kykL_2GGDeDonEc8FPatTEZ1KDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247820/chrome_gzBTjyadMK.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F59RzXeGt8N5dPJir6nkjUSBPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247841/chrome_I2YleCzF2R.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXBjVn"&gt;Twitter said in December that the accounts for @VP, @FLOTUS, @PressSec, @Cabinet, and @LaCasaBlanca would also have their followers wiped. As you can see in the images above, the @POTUS, @VP and @WhiteHouse accounts are quickly accumulating new followers. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198?st=qipqi5w4hwb57f8&amp;amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that there was originally contention between the Biden camp and Twitter over whether followers would transfer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4uztq"&gt;This is a reversal from what Twitter did in 2017 when the Trump administration took over accounts from the Obama administration. Back then, Twitter essentially duplicated the existing accounts, creating an archive of Obama-era tweets and followers and building a new set of accounts for the incoming administration that retained all of those followers without any of the tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CpbWbf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration will miss out on tens of millions of followers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Twitter didn’t say why it changed the policy this time. Twitter told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is “in ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers.” Biden’s team seems to be unhappy about this change in policy, given the significant digital advantage they’ll be losing. Flaherty said the transition team “pushed back and we were told this was unequivocal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd95gK"&gt;On Inauguration Day, anyone who follow one of the handles being transitioned will receive a notification that the account is being archived, a Twitter spokesperson said in December. They will also be given the option to follow the Biden administration’s new accounts. There are no details yet on what that notification will look like for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S903OI"&gt;While the president has plenty of pulpits to speak from, there’s no denying that Twitter is a major communications tool for the president after these last four years. Those accounts have significant followings to rebuild, too: @POTUS had 33 million followers, @WhiteHouse had 26 million, @FLOTUS had 16 million, and @PressSec had 6 million as of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhhCN0"&gt;Donald Trump’s @POTUS account will be renamed @POTUS45 and “frozen as-is,” the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. He would have originally been in control of @realDonaldTrump, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;with fewer protections&lt;/a&gt; than before, if Twitter had not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned him for inciting violence on January 8th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO2Whc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 5:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with new details from Twitter on the transition of accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPgpWx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 20th at 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter has now transitioned the Presidential accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The fight to make Netflix and Hulu pay cable fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExsAnHfpS9xaAy88BMhiS4KDd8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695312/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNr9a"&gt;Streaming services are slowly turning into cable TV — complete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;with bundles&lt;/a&gt;, an ever-growing list of channels, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21291519/justwatch-streaming-search-engine-filter-app-impressions-hbo-max-disney-plus-netflix-hulu"&gt;reinvented TV guide&lt;/a&gt;. And a series of lawsuits could portend the return of something even worse: the hidden cable fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5Jn1W"&gt;Three municipalities in Georgia are &lt;a href="https://media.bizj.us/view/img/11934567/gwinnett-vs-netflix-1.pdf"&gt;suing Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming video providers&lt;/a&gt; for as much as 5 percent of their gross revenue in the district — joining a nationwide group of towns and counties that want these services regulated more like cable TV. It’s a small but growing front in the war over cord-cutting, challenging regulators to decide which matters more: the increasing role streaming services play in American media diets or their significant practical differences from traditional TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aD7Efk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Missouri paved the way for pushing streaming franchise fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MSHVcN"&gt;The federal lawsuit, reported &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2021/01/11/gwinnett-netflix-disney-hulu-lawsuit-georgia.html?ana=TRUEANTHEMTWT&amp;amp;csrc=6398&amp;amp;taid=5ffd88444156da0001be218e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;earlier this month by &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Business Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was originally filed in state court last year. It argues that Netflix and Hulu — along with satellite providers Dish Network and DirecTV, as well as Disney’s entertainment distribution division — violated a 2007 law called the Georgia Consumer Choice for Television Act. That rule specifies that “video services” must pay a quarterly franchise fee to local governments, unless they’re part of a larger internet service package or operate wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOlQuz"&gt;Georgia isn’t the only place where local towns are pushing for streaming fees. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/why-cash-strapped-towns-are-suing-streaming-giants"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; reported last year&lt;/a&gt;, two law firms recently filed similar suits on behalf of towns in Texas, Indiana, Ohio, and Nevada. And in 2018, the city of Creve Coeur, Missouri paved the way by &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/netflix-tells-court-it-isnt-a-video-service-provider-1143229"&gt;suing Netflix and Hulu&lt;/a&gt; under that state’s franchise laws. With municipal budgets cratered by the pandemic, slapping a franchise fee on cash-heavy tech companies has never been more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trggy9"&gt;A single successful lawsuit could cost these companies millions. Gwinnett County, one of three municipalities named in the suit, charges 5 percent of a company’s local gross revenue in franchising fees. A filing calculates that Netflix made $103 million from Gwinnett County subscribers over the past five years — which would translate to $5.15 million in retroactive fees for that area alone. (Netflix declined to comment on the numbers cited in the story.) The plaintiffs in these cases are seeking class action status, which would make companies liable for any “similarly situated” state locales as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3c1PD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.verizon.com/t5/My-Verizon-Account/What-Is-A-Video-Franchise-Fee/td-p/816103"&gt;TV pr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.comcast.com%2Fhelp-and-support%2Fbilling%2Flearn-more-about-price-changes-on-your-bill&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22238785%2Fgeorgia-lawsuit-netflix-hulu-cable-franchise-fees-video-service#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;oviders&lt;/a&gt; have opted to directly bill subscribers for franchise fees, and companies like Netflix and Hulu could follow their lead, passing the costs to users. Those fees aren’t why &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9276655/cable-bill-high-why"&gt;cable costs so much&lt;/a&gt;, and they help fund important services — but they’re also something many consumers find irritating or bewildering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HNjXp5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All TV is streaming now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvefOt"&gt;If the cases succeed and aren’t preempted by any federal laws, they could draw streaming services — a category that’s exploded in popularity — under a new regulatory umbrella. Even traditional TV providers have moved to online streaming: the suit notes that Dish and DirecTV chose to “fundamentally change” their satellite-only options by adding services like the Dish-owned Sling TV, which routes live TV over broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISp7YI"&gt;The Georgia suit in particular could have broader, potentially unpredictable effects. Its definition seems to potentially encompass many smaller and less profitable streaming video companies, although there’s far less incentive to sue them. Meanwhile, the exemption for internet service packages could give telecom-run streaming offerings — like Comcast-owned NBCUniversal’s Peacock service — a built-in advantage over competitors like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hckL0y"&gt;The Consumer Choice for Television Act wasn’t passed with streaming video in mind. Passed in 2007, the law &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2007/04/09/newscolumn1.html"&gt;amended existing rules&lt;/a&gt; meant for cable TV providers, which pay franchise fees for the right of way to lay wires along public infrastructure like roads. “It’s a remnant of how we did cable franchising,” says John Bergmayer, legal director of the internet-focused nonprofit Public Knowledge. And it specifically exempts some services that don’t require that physical access, like programming from mobile services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7CHWc"&gt;Despite this, the municipalities contend that streaming companies tick the same legal boxes as cable TV. The complaint says people are getting a similar service; in the complaint’s words, they “view professionally produced and copyrighted television shows, movies, documentaries, and other programming.” More technically, it argues that this programming counts as a “video service” because it’s carried over public internet lines that require the right of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR9UPR"&gt;But conversely, the suit also notes that streaming giants like Netflix aren’t &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;running over a global internet backbone. They’re building local content delivery networks (or CDNs), like Netflix’s Open Connect, which route user traffic &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-box-can-hold-an-entire-netflix-1592590450"&gt;to a nearby server&lt;/a&gt;. Internet service providers in many states — &lt;a href="https://www.govtech.com/network/Georgia-Lawmakers-Grapple-with-Rural-Broadband-Right-of-Way-Rules.html"&gt;including Georgia&lt;/a&gt; — already pay for broadband rights of way, and the servers are located in data centers, not underground pipes or utility poles on public land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YtLGo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An early January ruling favored fee-seeking cities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J74JLT"&gt;The companies have objected to the string of franchise fee lawsuits. “These cases falsely seek to treat streaming services as if they were cable and internet access providers, which they aren’t,” a Netflix spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They also threaten to place a tax on consumers that the legislature never intended, and we are confident that the courts will conclude that these cases are meritless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwaDxq"&gt;Franchise fee claims — all based on different local laws — remain mostly untested in court. But earlier this month, a Missouri state judge &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/netflix-hulu-cant-hide-behind-internet-tax-freedom-act-in-missouri-fee-fight"&gt;rejected an early bid&lt;/a&gt; to toss that state’s lawsuit, agreeing with the claim that these companies were “video service providers.” The judge specifically noted the presence of CDNs like Open Connect, a system that “bypasses the ‘public internet’” and distinguishes streaming giants from smaller services. She also rejected claims that the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act provided blanket protection from the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTQjGO"&gt;With little precedent, it may take years to understand the implications of these cases. Companies will likely appeal any decision, and unless the Supreme Court takes up one of the cases, states will be covered under a patchwork of lower court rulings. But an increasing number of local governments see these fees as an opportunity to recover money from the services that are slowly replacing cable TV. “They need money now, and they’ve got this law on the books,” says Bergmayer. With the status of streaming services in flux, they’ve settled on an optimistic approach: “let’s go for it and see what happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Rc2j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential plus four smart lightbulbs are $30 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14o8aHh6aIxE39Y54qPTHGFu-ks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695010/dseifert_201030_4273_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEkGqw"&gt;Last October, Lenovo unveiled its new Google Assistant-powered alarm clock, the Smart Clock Essential. At just $50, the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is slightly smarter than your average bedside clock. Not only does it display time, weather conditions, and current alarms, but its compact design won’t take up much space on your nightstand or bedside table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atDGZo"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964159341561387" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is currently $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to take full advantage of Google Assistant and add some smarts to your home, Best Buy is currently offering a bundle that includes the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964099597317249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential and four C by GE Direct Connect Smart Bulbs for only $30&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X4y1K2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293534"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4G9VI"&gt;If you are in the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds and do not mind purchasing a refurbished pair, Best Buy is selling a pair of Samsung’s fantastic bean-shaped wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Live, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964564545124958" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for as low as $70&lt;/a&gt; — assuming you want them in white. You can also get them for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964539051709661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 in bronze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964552565718886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$85 in black&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7QxvN"&gt;If you want a new pair, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Live &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964625656411002" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $140 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, $30 off its usual price of $170. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuhBec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxALlx"&gt;Last year, publisher 505 Games released a Windows PC version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;. Although the game was released in 2019 as a PS4 exclusive, my colleague Sam Byford says Hideo Kojima’s latest title is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima"&gt;worth playing again on a PC&lt;/a&gt;, provided you have a gaming PC that can run the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soTlbA"&gt;If you are interested in picking up the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/death-stranding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fanatical&lt;/a&gt; is selling digital keys for $24 today and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdeath-stranding-pc%2F#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Green Man Gaming&lt;/a&gt; has marked the game down to $25. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vrbo is blocking new Washington, DC reservations during inauguration week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJdSuZSn_YDioOTYMYv4p5X0_TU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68691308/Vrbo_logo_dark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;vrbo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0AxJ2N"&gt;Vrbo has changed its stance on people making reservations in the Washington, DC area during the week of the inauguration. The company announced on January 19th, the day before the event, that it will block any new reservations through Friday, January 22nd. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234501/vrbo-cancel-reservations-washington-dc-inauguration-airbnb-capitol"&gt;Vrbo previously stated it was evaluating new bookings&lt;/a&gt; and that it would “take appropriate action in coordination with law enforcement” if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW28dL"&gt;The news was tweeted by Expedia Group (which owns Vrbo) and from the official Vrbo Twitter account. It comes in light of DC officials encouraging people to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/january/headline-891291-en.html"&gt;stay home and participate in the inauguration virtually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XXCZk3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Based on updated guidance provided by government officials regarding security threats, and as part of ongoing efforts to protect the safety of travelers, partners and communities, all new Vrbo reservations will be blocked in and around Washington, D.C. through Friday, 1/22.&lt;/p&gt;— Vrbo (@vrbo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vrbo/status/1351583247260672005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqmXRz"&gt;The company has slowly been changing its policies around inauguration rentals, after &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/vrbo-wont-cancel-inauguration-rentals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported that residents are concerned&lt;/a&gt; about extremists using the service to stay in DC. Vrbo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2Fvacation-ideas%2Fexplore-vrbo%2Ftravel-trends%2Fa-place-for-everyone-leaves-no-room-for-hate&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22239269%2Fvrbo-blocking-new-reservations-dc-inauguration#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says in a blog&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “encouraging hosts to cancel bookings” if they believe that the person is there to commit violence, but it’s not blanket-canceling existing reservations. The company does say it’s “re-vetting [them], to help ensure public safety,” but today’s news doesn’t change what Vrbo is doing about people who have already booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTBi2v"&gt;In comparison, Airbnb not only blocked new reservations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;but it canceled existing ones as well&lt;/a&gt;. On January 6th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExpediaGroup/status/1351050004312559617"&gt;Vrbo stated&lt;/a&gt; that all new reservations would be subject to increased scrutiny and security, but it seems like we’ll just have to trust that those measures were effective, as the new ban seems like it’ll only affect people who are booking last minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBJwBy"&gt;The home-sharing apps are not the only ones trying to avoid more violence in the nation’s capital ahead of tomorrow’s inauguration: Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233871/facebook-blocking-events-white-house-us-state-capitols-inauguration-day"&gt;shut down events near the White House&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have all worked to remove the distribution of Parler, an app that failed to moderate rioters during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236750/propublica-parler-capitol-riot-videos-timeline-resource"&gt;the attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iybqKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 10:02AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to clarify that hosts are encouraged to cancel reservations if they are concerned about violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
