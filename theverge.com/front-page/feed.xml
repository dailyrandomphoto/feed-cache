    <title>8BitDo now makes the best Switch pro controller</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Pro 2 gives you more features for less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="670ZAT"&gt;Nintendo’s official Pro Controller for the Switch is generally a pretty useful accessory, but it has its problems: the D-pad is unreliable, and it doesn’t really offer any “pro-level” functionality. 8BitDo’s latest controller improves on both of those issues while coming in at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDtjlu"&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 is an upgraded version of the SN30Pro Plus, already a well-regarded Switch controller. It uses Bluetooth and also works with PCs and mobile devices; there’s a physical control for flipping between Switch, X-input, D-input, and Mac. You can use it as a wired controller with a USB-C cable, too. I did try using it with my PC, but I feel like it makes more sense on the Switch due to the Japanese-style button layout with B on the bottom and A on the right. Or maybe I’m just too used to using Xbox controllers on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LmpJmn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10425473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C2O6qM"&gt;Aesthetically, it looks kind of like a cross between a SNES pad and a PlayStation controller, with a lozenge-shaped body, two handles, and symmetrically aligned analog sticks. The unit I have is decked out in a PlayStation-inspired gray colorway, though there’s also an all-black option and a beige model that evokes the original Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5msmA3"&gt;It’s not a huge controller, but it feels comfortable in my large hands, with easy access to all of the buttons and triggers. Just as importantly for me, the D-pad is good. It feels more or less like a SNES pad, and its placement above the left analog stick makes it more appropriate for games where it’s a primary input option. I’d much rather use the Pro 2 than Nintendo’s Pro Controller for just about any 2D game on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJo6CloJtJrnXDtsyayLpcWHz6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415567/09_l.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jOBeFz"&gt;The Pro 2’s key feature over its predecessor is the customizable back buttons that you can press with your middle finger. These are a common element of enthusiast-focused controllers today, from Microsoft’s Elite controllers to third-party offerings like the Astro C40 for the PS4. Sony also released an attachment that brings similar functionality to the DualShock 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2D8Te"&gt;These buttons are useful because they allow you to enter commands without taking your thumbs off the sticks. Most first-person shooters, for example, assign jumping to a face button, which means it can be awkward to activate while aiming at the same time. With controllers like the Pro 2, you can set a back button to work the same way as a given face button, freeing you up to design more flexible control schemes. The Pro 2 makes it much easier to manipulate the camera in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; battle, which might be worth the asking price alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmTyoI"&gt;The back buttons on the Pro 2 are responsive and clicky, activating with a slight squeeze. You can assign them through 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software app, which is now available for the Pro 2 on iOS and Android as well as PCs. It’s not quite as simple as some pro controller setups that let you remap the buttons directly on the controller itself, but it does support multiple profiles and works well enough. Beside button assignments, the app can also be used to modify the controller’s vibration strength and stick sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFwEbAZkw-2k0rYzhWc_gAL5088=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415579/DSCF7699.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcEtXZ"&gt;You do miss out on some of the Switch Pro Controller’s features with the 8BitDo Pro 2. While the rumble is solid, it doesn’t feel as precise as Nintendo’s HD Rumble in supported games. The Pro 2 also lacks an NFC reader, so it won’t work with Amiibo figurines. And it can’t be used to power the Switch on, which is common to most third-party controllers across various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iV1Kjb"&gt;For $49.99, though, those omissions are understandable. That’s $20 less than Nintendo’s equivalent option, let alone the pro controllers you’d find for the Xbox or PlayStation in the $180–$200 range. And all things considered, I’d take the 8BitDo Pro 2 over the official Nintendo controller most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ0nVB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 will start shipping on April 12th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 bundles are in stock at GameStop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCa4DJ0CcIrpvBef0PApVc97RoE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065781/vpavic_4278_20201030_0281.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAemQF"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you don’t mind buying a bundle, which includes additional items alongside the PS5, GameStop has restocked &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171T.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundles&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;There are two bundles we found that may be worth a buy if you are interested in what each package contains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tkmAH"&gt;The PS5 Digital Edition bundle — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, or about $200 more than the console alone goes for. Purchasing all of these items individually would tally up to the same $600, so you’re not forced into a marked-up price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QOBwi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle costs $730&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ultimate Launch Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War)&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card. Normally, all this stuff would retail for roughly $720 before tax, so there is a small price increase if you were to buy these items separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TPl5cX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcHuE8"&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third bundle up for sale today at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. For $760, you get the following: a PS5 console, which includes the disc drive; three games (&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;), an extra controller, plus a $20 gift card to GameStop. Adding up all these items together separately retails for about the same, so there’s no price gouging going on here, assuming you want all of these add ons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RWStGn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1uqxNf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s WeWork documentary gives us Adam Neumann and little else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WeWork Presents Second Annual Creator Global Finals At Microsoft Theater" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0YVC07IwbctBNCSgCKO_qLRRQ4=/0x0:5777x3851/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065722/1079941750.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocOEWx"&gt;The problem of making a documentary about a showman is that it’s hard not to be ensnared by him. &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt; is so focused on WeWork’s turbulent co-founder, Adam Neumann, that it ultimately loses the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsDD1s"&gt;WeWork, you may recall, was the subject of a tremendous scandal around the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;disclosures in the S-1 document required for its IPO&lt;/a&gt;. (The company is now &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/adam-neumanns-final-wework-act-helping-softbanks-spac-deal.html"&gt;attempting to go public using a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, which means someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;other than the SEC is doing the due diligence&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt;, premiering April 2nd on Hulu, is director Jed Rothstein’s abbreviated retelling of the events around the troubled company — but a lot of the weird details that made the WeWork story so riveting are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="URl7HU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neumann lifts a leg, lets out an audible fart, and then scolds the crew for laughing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNevfx"&gt;Some of the footage of Neumann is compelling. In the first few minutes of the documentary, we see a haggard Neumann trying to film a video for his IPO roadshow; very quickly, he lifts a leg, lets out an audible fart, and then scolds the crew for laughing too long. But the documentary’s focus on Neumann’s kooky antics in some ways obscures his veritable army of enablers, from Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son to his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, who is barely mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUFgOL"&gt;In doing this, the movie makes the same mistake that Reeves Wiedeman’s &lt;em&gt;Billion Dollar Loser&lt;/em&gt; does: it obscures just how weird things were at WeWork. Adam Neumann probably would have been allowed to continue smoking weed and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ceo-adam-neumann-invested-in-wavegarden-wave-startup-2019-9"&gt;investing in wave pools&lt;/a&gt; forever if the company had turned a profit. When WeWork was on the upswing, his eccentricities were treated as proof of his genius. (Steve Jobs was eccentric, too!) The story isn’t Adam — it’s a dysfunctional business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMTYQO"&gt;To the movie’s credit, it gives the value proposition for WeWork. See, 2008 was a &lt;em&gt;real estate&lt;/em&gt; crisis — though we remember the housing crisis, commercial real estate crashed, too. WeWork was a high-risk arbitrage play: sign a long-term lease with a distressed property at a low rate, design a cute workspace, and then charge people to work there. WeWork’s insight was to design in ways that catered to millennials: great coffee, welcoming decor, good food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMsTJI"&gt;Unfortunately, the documentary didn’t stick with real estate. Had Rothstein done so, there would have been more detail on how WeWork rented buildings from Adam Neumann. Ideally, there also would have been a glimpse into WeWork’s January 2019 rebranding to The We Company. This move cost WeWork $5.9 million, which went to We Holdings LLC, controlled by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey. (The deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516585/wework-the-we-company-rebrand-adam-neumann"&gt;was later unwound&lt;/a&gt;.) Both related-party transactions would have required approvals — it would have been nice to know how those meetings went and who was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GHLLfW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rather than hard-nosed reporting, we get a lot of footage of Adam and generalizations about millennials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rms5e3"&gt;Instead, these major red flags are mentioned briefly at the end, as part of the S-1 scandal. Rather than hard-nosed reporting, we get a lot of footage of Adam and generalizations about millennials. WeWork was something to believe in for a lot of vulnerable young people. This movie isn’t the first time WeWork has been compared to a cult and won’t be the last. (The title of &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporters Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell’s forthcoming book is &lt;em&gt;The Cult of We&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEo25v"&gt;The cult-y company wasn’t exactly unusual at the time; it’s a feature of Anna Wiener’s &lt;em&gt;Uncanny Valley&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;too. Some of WeWork’s woo-woo vibe comes from Rebekah Neumann, who ran WeGrow, the school portion of The We Company. Rebekah studied at the Kabbalah Centre and got Adam to attend as well. That spirituality was good for business since the Kabbalah headquarters was also where Adam met early investors &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rebekah-neumanns-search-for-enlightenment-fueled-weworks-collapse-22581874"&gt;such as Ashton Kutcher&lt;/a&gt;. Arguably, without Rebekah’s influence, WeWork wouldn’t have been able to play as much on its employees’ need to believe. The closest &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; comes to explaining any of this is a shot in which we glimpse a red string bracelet on Adam’s wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxOX99"&gt;A consistent feature of reporting on Adam is how charismatic he’s said to be. But this movie doesn’t deliver a charismatic leader, either — just a repetitive one. That’s a limitation of the footage: it’s all stuff Adam knows is being shot, and it’s all in service of a WeWork PR campaign. So that footage wouldn’t include, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827"&gt;for instance&lt;/a&gt;, the evening all-hands where Neumann talked about firing 7 percent of staff — then handed out shots and had Run-DMC’s Darryl McDaniels play a set that included “It’s Tricky.” To get anecdotes like that, you have to talk to people who were there. The documentary does this a little, but the employees are underused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXVI0D"&gt;Though we see Joanna Strange, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-25/wework-s-first-whistleblower-joanna-strange-tells-her-story?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the company’s first whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;, her appearance is brief — and the documentary doesn’t mention that WeWork sued her, and even sicced the FBI on her. (In fact, though &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1290356"&gt;the court system&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-directors-sue-softbank-over-terminated-3-billion-share-offer-11586271317"&gt;is seething&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/business/wework-neumann-discrimination-complaint.html"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17969190/wework-lawsuit-sexual-assault-harassment-retaliation"&gt;WeWork lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, we get very little mention of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weworks-adam-neumann-to-get-extra-50-million-payout-in-softbank-settlement-11614220906"&gt;any legal action&lt;/a&gt;.) Strange is one of the primary sources for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Foundering&lt;/em&gt; podcast, which details what the company cost its employees. Her recordings, aired on that podcast, show us what Adam sounded like when he didn’t know he was on the record — and contains far more commentary from WeWork employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UW6iZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The worst whiff is the movie’s corny ending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="777O2p"&gt;I also would have liked to hear more about WeLive, which sounds like a college dorm for twenty-somethings. Bonds were apparently intense; if you had friends outside WeLive, they came over once and never returned. Gradually, people who lived at WeLive formed a closed community. I would have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; to know more about who chose to live there and why. Hell, WeLive is probably its own documentary. It would have been nice, too, to hear from a WeGrow parent or three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2RIaV"&gt;The worst whiff is the movie’s corny ending. You see, everyone who was interviewed talks about the importance of community while putting their masks back on — because, of course, this was filmed during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Krjj7v"&gt;Here’s the thing: community &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;powerful! After all, that’s what binds people to cults even when they are experiencing doubt. Cult members aren’t stupid; they are usually educated, conscientious people who want to do good in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bounded-Choice-Believers-Charismatic-Cults/dp/0520240189?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to cult expert Janja Lalich&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just vulnerable — much like twenty-somethings who’ve never had jobs before and don’t know what’s normal in a workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy6JFi"&gt;To end &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; with inane platitudes about the importance of community is also to sell WeWork’s employees short. These people, often very young, worked grueling hours and therefore had little time outside their jobs. That kept them bound to their co-workers, the only form of community many of them had — and made it much harder to quit. When the IPO blew up, Adam got a golden parachute while these hard-working employees found out &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-employees-feel-sting-as-ex-ceo-stands-to-reap-11571870011"&gt;their stock options were worthless&lt;/a&gt;. They deserved better from WeWork. They also deserved better from this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sBZrV"&gt;WeWork was expanding so fast that its offices frequently weren’t done on the first day they were open; the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/who-makes-wework-phone-booths-a-now-defunct-manufacturer?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;carcinogenic fumes in the phone booths&lt;/a&gt; were, it turns out, the tip of the shoddy iceberg. (&lt;em&gt;Foundering&lt;/em&gt; has the best account of the mundane horrors WeWork employees dealt with: beer keg disasters, buildings that opened without bathrooms, condom wrappers in upsetting places, and thundering herds of mice.) The documentary &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; feels like a rushed attempt to slap together archival footage, and in so doing, tells the story of one &lt;em&gt;wild and crazy guy&lt;/em&gt;. If I’m McKelvey — or a WeWork board member, or anyone else who should have reined Adam Neumann in — I’d breathe a sigh of relief: I’m off the hook. Much like WeWork itself, Rothstein’s movie delivers mostly bombast, with little substance to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPotIm"&gt;	.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vq9X4e4u1zRjQgkbJlDLvrpBKpA=/0x55:2574x1771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065703/Clash_Heroes.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyOeO8"&gt;Finnish developer Supercell is best known for its mobile games &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;, and today, it announced plans to expand that fantasy universe in a big way. Supercell revealed that three new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; titles are in development. “On top of offering a new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; experience to current players, we want to broaden &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; to new audiences who haven’t experienced &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; before,” the developer wrote in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvO993"&gt;The games include: &lt;em&gt;Clash Ques&lt;/em&gt;t, a turn-based tactical adventure game; &lt;em&gt;Clash Mini&lt;/em&gt;, a virtual board game where you build teams of adorable miniatures; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, a co-op action roleplaying game. Supercell also notes that they’re all fairly early in development and will likely change in some ways as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LUwkug"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eKE9pf01FY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meEBjC"&gt;In fact, the developer is somewhat infamous for killing games in beta, so some of these titles might not see a wide release at all. “With your feedback, we think these three can become the great games that &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; fans deserve,” the developer says. “If they don’t meet the standards though, we’ll kill them and move on to other attempts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnTxmr"&gt;Even still, the trio of games represents a big push from the company to expand its popular fantasy universe; last year, Supercell also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21430993/clash-of-clans-royale-animated-short-youtube-supercell"&gt;its first CG animated short&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2016, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14053766/clash-a-rama-animated-series-the-simpsons-supercell-clash-of-clans"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; webseries helmed by writers who worked on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The push also shows the company’s growth in recent years. Two of the games — &lt;em&gt;Mini &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt; — will be the first titles out of Supercell’s new Shanghai studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz674w"&gt;“It’s important to note that the &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; game teams are 100 percent separate from the three [new] &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games (and the dev teams behind them),” the developer says. “Meaning these new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games won’t impact any development or support for existing Supercell games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uhUQU"&gt;There’s no word on when any of the new games will start rolling out in beta, but Supercell says it also has several other non-&lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games in development.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1avaZy"&gt;Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the latest release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which is joined by other titles like new versions of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Oregon Trail&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; World of Demons &lt;/em&gt;from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehBqNs"&gt;For the greats, Apple is adding a number of high-profile mobile hits to the service, including &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mini Metro&lt;/em&gt;, and a remaster of &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope&lt;/em&gt;. Timeless classics, meanwhile, refers to iconic games like backgammon, solitaire, and Zach Gage’s recent takes on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;sudoku&lt;/a&gt;. While most Arcade games are playable across Apple TV, Mac, and iOS, these new categories will only work on iPhone and iPad. The update adds more than 30 titles to the service, bringing the entire library to more than 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYldDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20870146/apple-arcade-launch-best-top-games-iphone-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;Apple Arcade first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;a new option for premium games&lt;/a&gt; on a platform that had become dominated by free-to-play experiences. The original pitch was a service full of new, largely exclusive games from developers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and a number of indie stalwarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Th5X"&gt;However, despite the quality games and relative low price (an Arcade subscription is $4.99 per month), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;Apple is reportedly not happy&lt;/a&gt; with the amount of engagement games are getting, which may be a reason behind this most recent shift in direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy creator’s latest game, Fantasian,  launches on Apple Arcade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBiX_CCwDIJj-9FK3XhRr6K1dAo=/156x0:1749x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064858/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_4.50.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="noucI8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, a new role-playing game from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasian/id1517339045"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Arcade. The game is playable on iOS, Mac, and Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nF89kX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is the latest from Sakaguchi’s studio Mistwalker, which he founded in 2004; the developer has since released games such as &lt;em&gt;The Last Story&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/em&gt;. Although &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; uses traditional RPG elements like turn-based battles, it’s been designed with handcrafted physical models — more than 150 dioramas in all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dW921S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; features touch controls but, according to Sakaguchi, is intended to deliver a console-like experience on mobile devices. The game follows an amnesiac hero searching for a way to regain his lost memories. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;a previous interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sakaguchi said that replaying &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/em&gt; made him want to return to his RPG roots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jmGHvY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ja" dir="ltr"&gt;日本ではFANTASIANがリリースされました。４月２日生まれ。奇しくも、これをつくるきっかけになったＦＦ６と同じ誕生日となりました。めでたい！&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FANTASIAN was released in JPN.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYisUt"&gt;The game was released yesterday in Japan. On Twitter, Sakaguchi noted &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; has the “same birthday” as one of his other games, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VI &lt;/em&gt;— a title that shares similar themes. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vfqOe"&gt;Many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Teams and Xbox Live, were down for more than two hours Thursday evening. The company says the services have fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMwLNg"&gt;“We have mitigated the issue impacting some service interruptions that customers may have experienced,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9nQvy"&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://status.office365.com/"&gt;Microsoft 365 status page&lt;/a&gt; said there was a “DNS issue affecting multiple Microsoft 365 and Azure services,” but it has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElb73"&gt;“We’ve successfully resolved the issue that was causing residual impact for SharePoint Online and we’ve confirmed that all Microsoft 365 services have returned to a healthy state,” Microsoft said in a statement on the &lt;a href="https://status.office365.com/"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll continue to monitor our services to ensure stable and reliable availability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHktwh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status"&gt;Microsoft 365 status Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; first acknowledged that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1377738432265396225"&gt;there was an issue at 5:45PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR8pRG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status page&lt;/a&gt; at one point said that many services had a “major outage,”  accounts, multiplayer, and cloud gaming, but they have all recovered. During the outage, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxsupport"&gt;@XboxSupport&lt;/a&gt; account also retweeted recent posts from the &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account about server issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo14XC"&gt;This isn’t the only recent Microsoft services outage. Microsoft Teams, Azure, and other Microsoft 365 services went down for about four hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;on March 15th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BbTv9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 1st, 10:57PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: All services have been fully restored, and we have updated this article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. cancels ‘New Gods’ from Ava DuVernay and an Aquaman spinoff from James Wan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9800LQBRr_TeLbWJsfCs4pNK4I=/59x0:709x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064242/Trench.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8n1HAu"&gt;Ava DuVernay’s &lt;em&gt;New Gods&lt;/em&gt; and James Wan’s &lt;em&gt;The Trench &lt;/em&gt;are no longer being developed at Warner Bros., according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ava-duvernays-new-gods-james-wans-the-trench-dc-movies-not-moving-forward-at-warner-bros"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/new-gods-the-trench-dc-films-not-moving-forward-james-wan-ava-duvernay-1234726401/"&gt;Deadline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dc-film-new-gods-the-trench-ava-duvernay-james-wan-1234942862/"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The two films, set to explore two of the more unusual parts of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), seemed like they could have been interesting diversions from the tone and style established in films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/15/16654362/justice-league-review-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-gal-godot-ben-affleck-ezra-miller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11294512/batman-vs-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-movie-spoilers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But in the turbulent world of DC film adaptations, nothing is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5vIJL"&gt;James Wan made a pivot to superhero movies with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140893/aquaman-review-dc-universe-jason-momoa-amber-heard-james-wan-nicole-kidman-wet-dave"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquaman &lt;/em&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, bringing an action-packed, slightly more goofy energy to a cinematic universe that was sorely needing something fun. As a spin-off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18217647/warner-bros-aquaman-sequel-trench-jason-momoa-james-wan-amber-heard-nicole-kidman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trench&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was Wan returning to the horror roots he established with &lt;em&gt;Saw&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring. &lt;/em&gt;The film was supposed to focus on the creepy deep sea fish kingdom Aquaman joins forces with in Wan’s original DC film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8tNUB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128540/ava-duvernay-new-gods-movie-dc-extended-universe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Gods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could have been even more critical to building out the DCEU, exploring New Genesis, the home planet of the New Gods and rivals to Darkseid, who is essentially the Thanos of DC comics. DuVernay would have been the first woman of color to helm a DC superhero film had &lt;em&gt;New Gods&lt;/em&gt; gone forward. &lt;em&gt;Love &amp;amp; Basketball &lt;/em&gt;director Gina Prince-Bythewood similarly made history when she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15692776/sony-spider-man-spinoff-gina-prince-bythewood-director"&gt;attached to direct a Spider-Man spinoff&lt;/a&gt;. Now, both projects have been cancelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzSzvF"&gt;Despite Warner Bros.’ decision to move on, DuVernay celebrated the work her and writing partner Tom King did on the project: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S1UZdb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tom, I loved writing NEW GODS with you. I’m upset that the saga of Barda, Scott, Granny, Highfather and The Furies ends this way. Diving into Kirby’s Fourth World was the adventure of a lifetime. That can’t be taken away. Thank you for your friendship. And remember... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DarkseidIs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DarkseidIs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XyyIjcB8Wv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XyyIjcB8Wv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ava DuVernay (@ava) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ava/status/1377725452228431873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ShICe3"&gt;As is often the case in Hollywood, just because either project is no longer in development, doesn’t mean DuVernay or Wan can’t return or won’t continue to play with WarnerMedia’s superhero-shaped toys. In a statement provided to press, Warner Bros. said it looked forward to a continued partnership and that “[&lt;em&gt;New Gods &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Trench&lt;/em&gt;] will remain in their skillful hands if they were to move forward in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Netflix’s Yasuke anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2I92fZdhZHRY9UXkVjQxHbLCP70=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064234/03_New_Main_YASUKE.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kOHESO"&gt;Netflix just released the first good look at &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming anime based on the true story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke"&gt;a Black samurai who lived in Japan during the 16th century&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the real-life source material, the show takes a few liberties with the story, as you can see in the fantastical first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPV1Ek"&gt;Here’s the basic synopsis from Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rzD6y6"&gt;In a war-torn feudal Japan filled with mechs and magic, the greatest ronin never known, Yasuke, struggles to maintain a peaceful existence after a past life of violence. But when a local village becomes the center of social upheaval between warring daimyo, Yasuke must take up his sword and transport a mysterious child who is the target of dark forces and bloodthirsty warlords. The story of Yasuke, the first African samurai who actually served the legendary Oda Nobunaga, will be released to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VAl0M8"&gt;The six-episode series also has some serious talent behind it. The show was created by LeSean Thomas (best known for creating &lt;em&gt;Cannon Busters&lt;/em&gt;), the lead character is voiced by LaKeith Stanfield, the soundtrack comes from Flying Lotus, and the animation is being handled by beloved studio MAPPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjaps3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Netflix on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
