    <title>HP’s new 16-inch Omen 16 has support for the latest Intel and AMD processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP Omen 16" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iPkkxySXefPUru1xlBzB38DUtDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316560/omen16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsD8Sy"&gt;HP made an almost overwhelming bunch of gaming announcements today, which include systems equipped with Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors: a new 16-inch Omen gaming laptop and an updated 17-inch version, along with a new budget-friendly gaming laptop line called Victus. There is also a new Nvidia G-Sync-compatible monitor. Other major tech companies — such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429417/lenovo-legion-7i-5i-pro-gaming-laptops-intel-h-series-qhd-16-10-aspect-ratio"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428828/msi-gaming-laptops-creator-z16-m16-ge76-gs66-prices-specs"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22425078/asus-intel-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-tiger-lake-h-chips"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt; — debuted their H-series-equipped laptops last week, but HP saved its news for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNBXzq"&gt;The Omen 16 (pictured above) has a 16.1-inch display and can be configured with up to QHD resolution using a fast 165Hz refresh rate. It’s got a 16:9 aspect ratio display (disappointing, since Lenovo and Asus have competing models offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;the more spacious 16:10 aspect ratio&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be able to choose between AMD and Intel’s latest processors for this model, up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5900HX or an Intel Core i7-11800H, and each tops out at the RTX 3070 in the graphics department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9qDa"&gt;If you run with Intel and get at least the RTX 3060 for graphics, you’ll get a Thunderbolt 4 port as part of the deal. Otherwise, both the AMD and Intel models share some highlights in common, including an SD card slot and an HDMI 2.1 port for up to 4K output at 120Hz on supported displays. The Omen 16 can ship with a maximum of 32GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz, and its battery tops out at an 83Wh capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DNESW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Intel-based version with the RTX 3060 includes a Thunderbolt 4 port&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxbZHt"&gt;The AMD and Intel models differ when it comes to how they handle storage. Both can have up to a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD, but on the Intel configuration, the SSD runs at PCIe 4.0 speeds and has dual slots for RAID 0 storage. The AMD model is limited to PCIe 3.0 speeds, but that should still be fast enough for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8DEqL"&gt;HP has only shared the prices for the starting models of the Omen 16. The AMD model with a Ryzen 7 5800H processor, an Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;RTX 3050 Ti&lt;/a&gt; graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, will cost $1,049.99. The Intel version that has the Core i7-11800H processor with the same storage and RAM, but with the RTX 3060 graphics chip, will cost $1,149.99. The Omen 16 is set to ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP Omen 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5exkt7_DCFZcrMCRxWArmgZBak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525791/omen17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Omen 17 packs in a 17.3-inch display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="THQtIP"&gt;HP’s Omen 17 is a bigger, more powerful gaming laptop that isn’t as configurable when it comes to processors. This model supports Intel only, going up to the Intel Core i9-11900H. You can get it with Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip powered at 165W and with up to 16GB of video memory, which should ensure great gaming performance at QHD resolution. Its 17.3-inch display can be bumped up to QHD resolution at a 165Hz refresh rate, just like the Omen 16. This laptop starts at $1,369.99 and will also ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP Victus 16" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQDWYOTykI5Q9GOkx0CdxoyBWJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525781/victus16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Victus, you’ll be able to choose between blue, black, or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BuFrxB"&gt;A new addition to HP’s lineup of gaming laptops is the Victus, a more budget-friendly 16-inch model, also available in June, that will cost $849.99 with an Intel processor or $799.99 with an AMD processor. You’ll be able to configure this one’s processor and graphics up to Intel’s Core i7-11800H or AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processors, with up to Nvidia’s RTX 3060 or AMD’s Radeon RX 5500M GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mz4MH"&gt;Memory and storage for the Victus is the same as for the Omen 16. You’ll be able to upgrade the Victus’ 16.1-inch display to QHD resolution at a 165Hz refresh rate, and the chassis comes in multiple colors (white, blue, or black). However, while HP talks a big game about the Omen 16 and Omen 17 having better airflow than before, resulting in lower running temperatures while gaming, the Victus might fall behind the more pricey Omen laptops in the cooling department. We won’t know how the Victus handles heat until we try it out ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvXcHrVbfjVmGaaBaG1d5l4636w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525788/omen25i.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vci181"&gt;Lastly, HP’s Omen 25i gaming monitor will cost $349.99 when it launches in July. It’s a 24.5-inch FHD IPS monitor that has slim bezels and adaptive sync to eliminate visual artifacts in games with AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync technology. Other notable features include a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and a color-accurate picture with 90 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrtMuv"&gt;HP has included some interesting features with this monitor, like a “Game Remaster” mode that uses filters to smooth over games that haven’t aged well and usually have jagged graphics. More impressive is its “Dynamic Crosshair” feature that can change color dynamically in order to remain easily visible when the contrast of your game’s scene changes. For games in which you’re going in and outdoors a lot, this could make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Model S Plaid ‘delivery event’ confirmed for June 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model S redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaOpNFE9bsVf_aquoTgGRIUYFDc=/8x0:2774x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316555/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_6.50.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxPqCc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;Tesla’s ultra-fast Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt;, which the company has been teasing since 2019, is finally ready for its public debut. The company will hold a “delivery event” on June 3rd at its factory in Fremont, California, CEO Elon Musk tweeted Thursday — though it’s unclear when Tesla actually plans on delivering the vehicle to customers. And there’s still no word on when we can expect to see Plaid versions of the Model X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIeRNL"&gt;The Model S Plaid, which is a step above Tesla’s Ludicrous trim level, can sprint from 0–60 mph in less than two seconds and reach speeds of up to 200 mph, Musk says. It will have a range of 520 miles, which is well above Tesla’s highest range models, and it will retail for $139,990. Musk says it will be the “fastest production car ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZiJa75"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla Model S Plaid delivery event&lt;br&gt;June 3 at our California factory&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fastest production car ever&lt;br&gt;0 to 60mph in under 2 secs&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1395286896842985479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PvVZ5Y"&gt;The Plaid Model S made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at Laguna Seca raceway in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where it lapped the famous California road course in just 1 minute and 36 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3vg9j"&gt;The Plaid powertrain is being offered as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;Tesla’s broader refresh for the Model S and X&lt;/a&gt;, with new exterior designs and simplified interiors. It’s the first major refresh for both vehicles since their release in 2012 and 2015, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gf0QMt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another delay for Tesla’s speediest EVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GQZANn"&gt;A delivery event in June but no word on actual customer deliveries could indicate another delay for Tesla’s speediest EVs. Customers who ordered the Plaid Model S in January were originally told to expect deliveries to begin in April, &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/502601/tesla-model-s-plaid-delayed/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The company later said that those dates were being pushed to July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJLt26"&gt;Of course, Tesla is not inured to the challenges facing the entire auto industry, including supply chain problems and a global semiconductor chip shortage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;In an April earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said deliveries of the refreshed Model S should begin “shortly” without specifying an exact date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isyHtG"&gt;According to Tesla’s website, Plaid Model S deliveries are expected “August-September,” while Plaid Model X won’t reach customers until “January-February” 2022. Plaid Plus versions of both vehicles, with the extended 520 miles of range, aren’t expected until “mid-2022.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is opening its first physical retail store this summer in NYC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBxNBAaT2rnN8YWGIKzMn8MDLNk=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316429/Photoshop_Blade_Sign.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZWwlXL"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/devices-services/google-store-nyc/"&gt;opening its first physical retail Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced today, which will debut in New York City this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhsbTy"&gt;The new store will be &lt;a href="http://googlestore.com/Chelsea"&gt;located in Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, as part of Google’s campus in that neighborhood (the company’s New York headquarters are already located there). The Google Store will display and sell a variety of Google products: Pixel phones, Nest smart home devices, Fitbit trackers, Pixelbooks, and more. Customers will also be able to order products through Google’s online stores and pick them up in person at the physical Google Store location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyK9l3"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13346950/google-pop-up-shop-new-york-city-pixel-daydream-vr"&gt;experimented with small pop-up stores&lt;/a&gt; and booths before to sell its products, but today’s store announcement marks a far more serious commitment to establishing a retail space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rxUagT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A place to try and buy Google gadgets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HLSdA"&gt;Of course, it’s impossible to talk about Google opening a physical retail location without mentioning Apple’s own Apple Stores, from which it seems Google will be borrowing more than a few ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh8DJ6"&gt;Like an Apple Store, the new Google Store will showcase how Google’s products work together, offer in-store experts to help troubleshoot problems, assist with setups, work on repairs, and feature how-to workshops to make the most of Google’s products and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nkA2n"&gt;Google also notes that while the new store will allow customers to try out its hardware, it’ll still be taking precautions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when the store launches. Those measures include limiting the number of customers, regularly cleaning the store, and requiring that guests wear masks, socially distance from each other, and utilize hand sanitizer when in the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BStA3j"&gt;The Google Store in Chelsea is set to open to the public sometime over the summer. Google has yet to announce whether it’ll be expanding beyond the single location, but presumably, if successful, the Chelsea store may just be the first of many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GF7Qap"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will ask daters to think before they send potentially offensive messages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPIoWQk1M58PeVzrTi1laSMyqxk=/0x109:1412x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316375/TINDER_Are_You_Sure_MOCKUP_3A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tinder is launching Are You Sure?, a feature that asks users if they’re positive they want to send a possibly offensive message. | Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hb1ogk"&gt;Tinder’s newest safety feature attempts to reduce the number of hateful messages sent on its platform. The company plans to start rolling out Are You Sure?, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to automatically detect offensive language. If found, the program will ask users if they’re positive they want to send that message, forcing them to pause before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwL6ww"&gt;The company’s been testing the feature and says people who saw the prompt were less likely to be reported for inappropriate messages over the next month, which Tinder takes to mean that they’re adjusting their behavior over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5xs4o"&gt;Other companies have employed similar technology, including, most notably, Instagram, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024051/instagram-captions-potentially-offensive-ai-moderation-bullying-edit"&gt;rolled out warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive captions in 2019. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892802/instagram-ai-offensive-comment-filter-launches"&gt;automatically hides comments&lt;/a&gt; its AI determines are offensive and recently expanded the system to block words that might be purposely misspelled to avoid people’s comment filters. Although Tinder isn’t outright blocking messages, at least not yet, it’s pushing people to reconsider whether their message might be enough to make the app at least somewhat safer and more welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEGhukoMXQ3jbIcj5hR2SZQrAt8=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316368/1232992744.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="itNUqx"&gt;Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi had a tricky task in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;explaining why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z65mDK"&gt;Mac computers have an official Apple App Store, but they also allow downloading software from the internet or a third-party store. Apple has never opened up iOS this way, but it’s long touted the privacy and security of both platforms. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;Epic Games sued Apple&lt;/a&gt; to force its hand, saying that if an open model is good enough for macOS, Apple’s claims about iOS ring hollow. On the stand yesterday, Federighi tried to resolve this problem by portraying iPhones and Macs as dramatically different devices — and in the process, threw macOS under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K95LbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iPhones are very attractive targets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hokj"&gt;Federighi outlined three main differences between iOS and macOS. The first is scale. Far more people use iPhones than Macs, and the more users a platform gets, the more enticing that audience becomes to malware developers. Federighi argued iOS users are also much more casual about downloading software, giving attackers better odds of luring them into a download. “iOS users are just accustomed to getting apps all the time,” he said, citing Apple’s old catchphrase: “There’s an app for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0TgRc"&gt;The second difference is data sensitivity. “iPhones are very attractive targets. They are very personal devices that are with you all the time. They have some of your most personal information — of course your contacts, your photos, but also other things,” he said. Mobile devices put a camera, microphone, and GPS tracker in your pocket. “All of these things make access or control of these devices potentially incredibly valuable to an attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnZXcz"&gt;That may undersell private interactions with Macs; Epic’s counsel Yonatan Even noted that many telemedicine calls and other virtual interactions happen on desktop. Still, it’s fair to say phones have become many people’s all-purpose digital lockboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaO4St"&gt;The third difference is more conceptual. Federighi basically says iOS users need to be more protected because the Mac is a specialist tool for people who know how to navigate the complexities of a powerful system, while the iPhone and iPad are — literally — for babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psg99x"&gt;As Federighi put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ttwNKA"&gt;The Mac from the beginning has been part of a generation of systems where the expectation is you can get software from wherever — you can hand it to your friend on a floppy disk and run it, that’s part of the expectation. But Mac users also expect a degree of flexibility that is useful to what they do. Some of them are software developers, some of them are pros running their unique tools, and having that power is part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUhnG6"&gt;I think of it is as if the Mac is a car — that you can take it off-road if you want, you can drive wherever you want. And that comes with as a driver, you gotta be trained, there’s a certain level of responsibility in doing that, but that’s what you wanted to buy. You wanted to buy a car. With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — can operate an iOS device, and be safe in doing so. So it’s a really different product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDAns"&gt;Federighi expanded on the metaphor a little later, when Apple’s counsel asked if macOS was “safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PwNnbL"&gt;Safe if operated correctly, much like that car. If you know how to operate a car, and you obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes. If you’re not — I’ve had a couple of family members who’ve gotten some malware on their Mac. But ultimately, I think the Mac can be operated safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VTp5"&gt;I find the mental image of slowly, cautiously “driving” a Mac around the internet hilarious, because cars are deadly two-ton metal boxes that crush obstacles at superhuman speeds, while my MacBook starts losing keys if I type on it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRkbD"&gt;If you pair these comments with some earlier statements about macOS, though, it’s a bit less funny. Federighi was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;bluntly critical&lt;/a&gt; of macOS security, saying Apple saw “a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable.” If you used the Mac’s security model on the iPhone, “with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said. “iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today.” It’s a distinctly negative evaluation of open computing systems, implying only&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a relatively small platform could afford that openness without disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzU8Lt"&gt;Federighi took a far broader view of security than Epic’s own expert witness James Mickens. Mickens testified earlier that iOS wasn’t meaningfully more secure than Android, but he analyzed mostly technical threats to the platforms. Federighi focused on scams, phishing, and other apps that target human psychology instead of computer code — many of which pose serious dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIJu8"&gt;Sometimes, though, the protectiveness felt patronizing. When Federighi explained Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming, he focused partly on tangible security issues, like how to grant device permissions for different titles on a single gaming app. But he slipped seamlessly into discussing how the concept would be simply too confusing — that iPhone and iPad owners would be befuddled by the notion of launching a separate game catalog. Apple wants iOS devices to feel trustworthy, but at times like that, it seems more like Apple just doesn’t trust its own users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome OS’s Linux app support is leaving beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6gEqFDRV00cDES2TJNvJi_T1ug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316309/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KpW10B"&gt;Three years after Chrome OS first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/8/17318340/chrome-os-update-new-features-linux-apps-google-io-2018"&gt;started offering support for Linux apps&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is leaving beta, the search giant announced &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/a8kkzdOfAgU?t=630"&gt;during a Google I/O 2021 developer session&lt;/a&gt;. It’s happening in Chrome OS’s “next release,” which &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/linux-chromebooks-finally-coming-out-beta-chrome-os-91?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; is version 91, due to enter the stable channel in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4Agz8"&gt;Chrome OS as an operating system has always been based on Linux, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/8/17318340/chrome-os-update-new-features-linux-apps-google-io-2018"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; its Linux development environment has offered access to a Linux terminal, which developers can use to run command line tools. The feature also allows full-fledged Linux apps to be installed and launched alongside your other apps. In addition to Linux apps, Chrome OS also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20903281/chromebook-os-android-apps-how-to-use"&gt;supports Android apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cPT2N6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chrome OS can also run Android apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FaZyYW"&gt;As well as announcing the end of the beta, Google developer advocate Emilie Roberts touted a number of improvements Google has made to the Linux functionality in Chrome OS over the past year. These include a new terminal app, a faster update process that updates the Linux container at the same time as Chrome OS itself, as well as better support for USB devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4GnWm"&gt;Google’s announcement came exactly a year after Microsoft announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263377/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-gpu-acceleration-wsl-features"&gt;support for Linux GUI apps in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft recently started testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396018/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-task-manager-app-throttling-features"&gt;Linux GUI apps on Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature is expected to launch to all users later this year. It’s part of an initiative to better support developers that Microsoft kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11333522/microsoft-ubuntu-bash-windows-step-in-right-direction"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZd12I"&gt;As well as announcing that its Linux development environment is coming out of beta, Google shared a couple of additional updates about Chrome OS. It’s rolling out Android 11 to more machines, which will bring new features like better Android app optimization and a new dark theme. Fifty new Chromebooks are due to launch later this year, Google added.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok now lets you wipe out up to 100 nasty comments at once</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCHZeOXayhxQmmXUDa4MY8EL3DU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315907/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHikgk"&gt;TikTok is making it much easier for creators to quickly report harassing comments. With an update that starts rolling out today, the app is adding the ability to select multiple comments at once — up to 100 — so that creators can delete and report remarks or block accounts in bulk. Creators previously had to go one by one when reporting, deleting, or blocking, so this new system should help and perhaps even encourage people to wipe out comments they don’t want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XP7Y9H"&gt;The feature should be particularly helpful on TikTok, since the network’s vaunted algorithm can rocket anyone to stardom in an instant, suddenly placing them in front of millions of unknown viewers. That can put unsuspecting amateurs and seasoned creators alike in a position to receive harassing comments, and the app needs to provide a way for them to deal with it at a scale that matches TikTok’s huge viewership numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUiqyX"&gt;TikTok says the feature rolls out today in “select markets” and globally in the “coming weeks.” It’s the latest in a series of anti-harassment features, including the option to approve comments one by one before they appear and a prompt that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322814/tiktok-inappropriate-or-unkind-comments-warning-pop-up-anti-bullying"&gt;tells people to reconsider their post&lt;/a&gt; if TikTok thinks they’ve written something that goes against its community rules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pop-up in the middle of the screen reads, “Delete 5 comments? You’ve selected 5 comments” with the option to cancel or delete. Beneath the pop-up, comments are shown with boxes checked beside several of them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogLA0oZ7SotsnDTq4nbrq4st2J0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526243/Screenshot_Bulk_Delete_Report_and_Block_Accounts.png"&gt;

    <title>Senators roll out bipartisan data privacy bill </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Confirmation Hearing On Biden’s First Slate Of Judicial Nominees" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqortiliaH-DE6ba-C6WX0JINcI=/0x1:4637x3092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315955/1232578929.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XTbMdj"&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar is back with a bill to protect consumer data privacy when collected by large tech platforms like Facebook and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z76gSa"&gt;Klobuchar (D-MN) has teamed up with a bipartisan group of senators, including Sens. John Kennedy (R-LA), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Richard Burr (R-NC), to reintroduce the Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act. The privacy legislation would force websites to grant users greater control over their data and allow them to opt out of data tracking and collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ik96kq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This legislation will protect and empower consumers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K0L7YF"&gt;“For too long companies have profited off of Americans’ online data while consumers have been left in the dark,” Klobuchar said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This legislation will protect and empower consumers by allowing them to make choices about how companies use their data and inform them of how they can protect personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwAJBy"&gt;The bill would also require platforms to write their terms of service agreements in plain language so users understand what they’re accepting by using the platforms. If a website were to suffer a data breach, it would have to notify users within 72 hours of it occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI0ZEe"&gt;“In today’s world, ownership and agency over one’s internet data is essential in protecting users’ privacy online,” Burr said. “This bipartisan legislation is a commonsense step in granting individuals a greater ownership over the type of information companies may collect on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE84fT"&gt;Klobuchar first introduced the bill in 2019 after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal. At the time, the bill stalled without support from the Republican majority — but now that Democrats control Congress, it has a new chance to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmXUis"&gt;In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;announced a $5 billion settlement with Facebook&lt;/a&gt; after a yearslong investigation into the scandal. As part of the settlement, the company is required to conduct quarterly privacy reviews and obtain purpose and use certifications from third-party developers that want to use Facebook data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbyUsT"&gt;Another force working in the bill’s favor are the dozens of state-level privacy bills that have taken effect since the bill was first introduced, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;, or CCPA. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20960113/microsoft-ccpa-privacy-law-california-congress-regulation"&gt;Companies like Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have vowed to honor the CCPA in states outside of California, but the sheer volume of overlapping statutes has created a growing desire for a federal privacy framework that would make corporate compliance simpler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPKezR"&gt;The tech companies are pushing for federal rules as well. Last July, Facebook published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;a white paper&lt;/a&gt; calling current US privacy laws “insufficient” and called on the federal government to develop a national framework. The company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/privacy-conversations-the-future-of-privacy-legislation-with-alex-givens/"&gt;revamped that call&lt;/a&gt; this March after Virginia passed its own protections through the Consumer Data Protection Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEuINi"&gt;“We welcome the CDPA and hope that it, as well as legislative proposals in other states, will serve as an impetus for Congress to pass a comprehensive federal privacy law this year,” Facebook wrote in a March blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfdHIu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZIGBEE ON MARS!</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3oWLfrM-P1cZ78Zdciud2GmBOGE=/78x0:909x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315820/pia23720_1041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter communicates telemetry over Zigbee to the NASA’s Perseverance rover. | Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kKfmpu"&gt;Today I learned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424821/nasa-ingenuity-mars-perseverance-video-audio-helicopter"&gt;Ingenuity drone copter&lt;/a&gt; twirling about on Mars communicates with the Perseverance rover using 900MHz Zigbee radios. Not Wi-Fi, GSM, or something exotic like fission-powered lasers or space algae, but the same consumer tech you use to turn on a Philips Hue lightbulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twZGAM"&gt;I came across the news via an incredulous tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benuski/status/1395027967013703683"&gt;Ben Bromley&lt;/a&gt; who discovered it on the &lt;a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/406"&gt;Linux Unplugged podcast&lt;/a&gt; with guest Tobin Richardson, CEO of the Zigbee Alliance, recently rebranded the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0MC5M"&gt;According to Richardson, Zigbee is the ideal wireless protocol to transfer telemetry data between NASA’s Perseverance rover and the semi-autonomous flying drone. “Looking at really extreme environments, like Mars, it’s good to have a very lightweight purpose-built standard,” &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/zigbee-inside-the-mars-perseverance-mission-and-your-smart-home/"&gt;said Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, “where it’s essential to get the basic information across and makes it possible for extended battery usage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g2WQvq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What makes Zigbee great at home also makes it great on Mars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="43jdWn"&gt;It turns out that what makes Zigbee great for smart homes also makes it highly suitable for missions to the Red Planet. The Zigbee wireless protocol exemplified “low energy” long before Bluetooth adopted the LE specification. That makes it ideal for the trivial data needs of small, battery-powered smart home devices like motion and temperature sensors, and also for lightweight drones. The protocol is also very robust, designed to operate in a mesh of nodes that can overcome packet delivery failures without interfering with neighboring signals. That’s the sort of reliability you also want when operating on a different planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6lHlh"&gt;Zigbee also has plenty of range. In the home, the Zigbee Alliance claims its signal can reach about 150 feet. But that can be stretched much farther with line-of-sight, and presumably farther still in the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars, which lacks the dense radio interference seen here on Earth. According to NASA, the four-pound Ingenuity helicopter is capable of communicating with the &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25525/mars-helicopter-base-station-on-perseverance-rover/"&gt;Mars Helicopter Base Station&lt;/a&gt; on the Perseverance drone from as far as “nine football fields away” or about 2,700 feet. If you want that sort of range for your own smart home products, well, start packing your bags for Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRBy9S"&gt;When reached for comment, the Consortium For Hey Don’t Forget About Z-Wave said it would happily setup on any old space rock. “We’re good too,” said a spokesperson clearly surprised by the attention. “No, really.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google rediscovers RSS: tests new feature to ‘follow’ sites in Chrome on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyJwV0QSgsrqA7zqV31JH2mwWPA=/78x143:920x704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315636/google_rss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users follow sites through the browser’s menu, with an aggregated feed shown when they open a new tab. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwJyop"&gt;Google is testing a new feature for its Chrome browser on Android that lets users “follow” sites to create an updating list of new content they publish. The feature is based on RSS, an open web standard that’s been the backbone of many popular web aggregation tools in the past. That includes Google’s own, much beloved (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service#:~:text=Google%20says%20it%20is%20killing,seen%20waning%20popularity%20since%20the"&gt;now defunct&lt;/a&gt;) Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyGXbR"&gt;The test is small-scale: following sites will only be an option for some US users of Chrome Canary (the bleeding-edge version of Chrome that lets enthusiasts access beta features). Users will be able to follow sites from the browser menu, and updates will be aggregated in a card-based feed that’s shown when users open a new tab. It’s not clear whether this feed is wholly dependent on sites providing RSS support, or if Google will fill in the gaps itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZx8EU"&gt;Although this is just an early test, it’s nonetheless exciting for a certain sort of web user who misses the glory-days of RSS (and, by extension, a mode of internet discovery and distribution that faded years ago). At its core, RSS allows users to maintain a personalized feed of new content from favorite sites, blogs, and podcasts. And although tools that utilized these feeds were briefly very popular, they were eclipsed for numerous reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Offlv"&gt;Exactly why RSS fell from prominence is complicated. (Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss"&gt;story from &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/"&gt;one from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that help explain.) But whatever the ultimate cause, many see its demise as a turning point for the web: the moment when decentralized, chronological feeds were replaced by the engagement-driven algorithms of social media giants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Reader stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POHo3K7_8D600TfaiyfFwyR9K_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2147505/20130211-10455160-4-IMG_3044.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The halcyon days of 2013: the year of Google Reader’s death. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F50XD4"&gt;Because the rise of Facebook, Twitter, and the like have had so many obviously bad effects (misinformation! Hoaxes! Nazis!), many look back wistfully on RSS as a sort of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9438651/you-can-have-your-ad-blockers-i-ll-stick-with-rss"&gt;Golden Age for the web&lt;/a&gt; that failed from a surfeit of nobility and deficit of cunning. “If only RSS had thrived!” they say. “All this nastiness could have been avoided.” Perhaps. What’s clear is that Google is responding to a demand for new (read: old) ways of engaging with the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts10P"&gt;“We’ve heard it loud and clear: Discovery &amp;amp; distribution is lacking on the open web, and RSS hasn’t been ‘mainstream consumer’ friendly,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pbakaus/status/1395091617732644864"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Google’s head of web creator relations, Paul Bakaus. “Today, we’re announcing an experimental new way, powered by RSS, to follow creators with one click.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC4wlY"&gt;What happens next is anyone’s guess. Will Google follow through and push RSS-powered features to all Chrome users? Or will it get bored of a product that’s not integral to its bottom line? (As it did with Google Reader.) Bakaus, at least, suggests there’s more to come. “This is only the beginning of a bigger exploration, and to get this right, we need your feedback,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pbakaus/status/1395091619397791744"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “Hit us up via @WebCreators to let us know what we need to build for you. I’m very excited about it!”&lt;/p&gt;
