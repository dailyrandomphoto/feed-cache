    <title>Volkswagen ID 4 review: electric chill</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UiHo3B2aGdGAhG1z585Tkz9Cg2Q=/0x348:8256x5852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891239/B2247068.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want an electric car with decent range, low-key technology, and not much else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iUCfuM"&gt;Once upon a time, affordable electric compact SUVs were very hard to come by. There were plenty of cheap electric hatchbacks and a whole mess of luxury sedans and SUVs, but you’d have to cough up $50,000 or more if you wanted one. Then came the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/3/15/18266881/tesla-model-y-suv-interior-controls-first-drive-2019"&gt;Tesla Model Y&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;the Ford Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, and now our cup runneth over with reasonably priced battery-powered crossovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5GUvK"&gt;The latest to emerge is the Volkswagen ID 4, an absolutely delightful compact electric SUV with a decent amount of range, some quirky designs, and a whole lot of potential. It’s also a milestone for the automaker as its first long-range electric vehicle available in North America, the first electric SUV, and the second EV powered by its MEB modular electric architecture. But more than that, the ID 4 is a relatively affordable EV with a lot of the SUV DNA that car buyers in the US really crave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L4VnL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An affordable EV with a lot of the SUV DNA that car buyers really crave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1HugD"&gt;This was my second time driving the ID 4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502032/volkswagen-id4-electric-suv-first-drive-vw"&gt;The first time&lt;/a&gt;, I only had it for a couple of hours; this time, VW lent it to me for two days, and I drove it all over North New Jersey — on highways, residential streets, and even some rural roads. During that time, I got a lot of admiring stares from an interesting cross-section of passersby. Even the toll booth operator on the Garden State Parkway let out a whistle of approval after I handed him my $1.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZek1l"&gt;“That looks sweeter than a Tesla,” he said with a raised eyebrow. This from a guy who literally watches thousands of cars pass by every day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VmsAug0ufbEHtfTwqusaSzc4f4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331911/B2247068.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="70jWvW"&gt;LET’S SEE SOME ID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NtQ7Rx"&gt;Last year, when Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21444141/volkswagen-vw-id4-electric-suv-price-range-specs"&gt;unveiled the ID 4 for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at an eerily empty, socially distanced event in Brooklyn, the company’s CEO for North America, Scott Keogh, warned me not to make the obvious comparisons to other EVs, like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO1TXK"&gt;That’s because VW views its &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;competition as all of the popular gas-powered compact SUVs, like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Rav4. The company has its eyes on a higher prize: not just the most popular electric vehicle in its segment, but the most popular vehicle on the road, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGy5Nl"&gt;It’s too early to tell whether the ID 4 will live up to those lofty expectations, but I can report that it is simply a great car. It has plenty of range for daily driving and short trips (but probably not anything longer than that), the technology inside feels intuitive without being in your face, and the really surprising thing is the whimsicality of the ID 4 — like VW wants you to just have fun while driving it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7WMgo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Of course, the ID 4’s origins aren’t so playful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJgaAB"&gt;Of course, the ID 4’s origins aren’t so playful. The car wouldn’t be here today without &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/23/9384791/volkswagens-huge-diesel-emissions-scandal-the-full-story"&gt;Dieselgate, the massive emissions cheating scandal&lt;/a&gt; that nearly crippled VW five years ago. As part of its many settlements, VW agreed to dedicate billions of dollars toward electric vehicles. That’s we’re getting the ID 4 in the year 2021 and not two or three years from now when the EV market is a bit more mature. Consider it an apology for all that extra pollution created by its millions of diesel vehicles (11 million to be precise). And as far as apologies go, the ID 4 is a pretty great start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebW12b"&gt;So let’s talk about the car itself. There are three different trim levels: the Pro, the Pro S, and the First Edition, which is the one we have and obviously the first one available for sale. The First Edition ID 4 only comes with rear-wheel drive, while both the Pro and Pro S will have rear-wheel &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;all-wheel drive options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NALyoW"&gt;You can choose from six exterior colors: “glacier white,” “mythos black,” “moonstone grey,” “scale silver,” “blue dusk,” and “king’s red.” I got the blue color, which I really like; it pops without being too ostentatious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgIbg2"&gt;The cheapest model, the Pro with rear-wheel drive, will retail for $39,995, while the most expensive trim, the all-wheel drive Pro S, will sell for $48,175. But when you factor in the $7,500 federal tax credit, plus any state and local incentives, the base model ID 4 lands in that low- to mid-$30,000 range that’s generally considered the sweet spot for most car buyers. That’ll still be prohibitively expensive for a lot of people, especially when you consider those gas-powered variants like the Rav4 often go for less than $25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsqlLm"&gt;The First Edition ID 4 is expected to get 250 miles of range on a single charge — but that hasn’t been certified yet by regulators. It’s possible that the Environmental Protection Agency will rate the ID 4 with less than 250 miles of range, which could drive away those customers who have dreams of road-tripping across the country in their electric vehicle. Either way, it’s not as much as the Tesla Model 3 or Model Y, but I think it will suit a lot of people’s needs. (&lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35633671/2021-volkswagen-id4-range-tested/"&gt;A recent highway range test by &lt;em&gt;Car &amp;amp; Driver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;only got 190 miles. Big yikes!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-7MjH1-QZ4SDwcTk1Oh-e0isMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331954/B2247045.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HFSBt7"&gt;VW says “every effort” has been made to optimize aerodynamics as a way to improve the vehicle’s range. You can see that with the swooping lines in the body of the vehicle, the large roof spoiler, and the door handles that are flush against the side. Again, not exactly revelatory (a lot of EVs have similar features), but it does show that VW is thinking seriously about ways it can improve the vehicle’s daily performance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YoSuH"&gt;The ID 4 has an 82 kilowatt-hour battery pack, 77 kWh of which are usable. It’s located in the floor of the vehicle, helping create a low center of gravity. The electric motor is located in the rear of the vehicle, which is similar to the original Volkswagen Beetle. You can feel that when you’re on a winding road, and the ID 4 is really hugging the curves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxr7j1"&gt;Initially, the ID 4’s battery pack, which is comprised of 288 pouch cells in 12 modules, will be produced by South Korea’s LG Chem. But once ID 4 production shifts to Chattanooga, Tennessee, the batteries will be &lt;a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2020/jun/26/sk-innovation-plans-940-million-expansion-georgia/526225/"&gt;supplied by SK Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, another South Korean company that recently opened a $2 billion factory nearby VW’s plant there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bQg0yB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can feel that when you’re on a winding road, and the ID 4 is really hugging the curves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahbfyx"&gt;There are four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, and a custom setting that allows drivers to pick and choose from the other modes to best suit their own style. Just like I live my life, I did most of my driving in Comfort. It’s got pretty good oomph for an EV, with 201 horsepower and 228 pound-feet of torque. It can sprint from 0 to 60 in a little over 7 seconds — that’s what VW claims; I didn’t test it myself. That’s nowhere near as fast as Tesla’s performance models, but it makes sense when you consider the curb weight is over two tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1NZ8p"&gt;While driving, if you expected a low-grade motor whir common with EVs, and you’d be right. No noisy combustion under the hood means no noise radiating throughout the vehicle’s interior. As you accelerate, the motor definitely emits a higher-pitch sound, but it’s not distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEoHLl"&gt;There is a fake sound that the vehicle makes at low speeds, as required by law to alert pedestrians and cyclists. It reminded me of that episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;where &lt;a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Leader#:~:text=Biography,come%20to%20an%20introductory%20session."&gt;the cult leader who promised alien salvation&lt;/a&gt; to the people of Springfield is revealed to be a guy with a kazoo on a pedal-powered aircraft. Don’t ask me why my brain works this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kuEfB"&gt;Thanks to a narrow A-pillar and a stubby front end, I felt like I could see everything I was supposed to from the driver’s seat. So many SUVs on the market today have gargantuan front ends, creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;dangerous front blind spots&lt;/a&gt; for drivers that could be fatal, especially for children. Compact SUVs don’t typically have this problem, but it felt like VW made the necessary design choices to ensure maximum visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Q_N05LKM14sJ0TP5VbfHAR4BLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331952/B2247050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hhTim0"&gt;EVS, BUT MAKE IT FASHION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rDDPag"&gt;One of my favorite parts of the ID 4 is the front and rear lights. Normally, I’m not into illuminated vehicle badges, but there’s something appealing about the light bar stretching across the full width of the vehicle. It’s the ID 4’s way of saying, “Hey, I’m an electric car” without exactly clubbing you over the head with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5cvwC"&gt;There are actually a lot of cool lighting accents all over this vehicle. At nighttime, a hexagonal light emanates from both the driver and passenger doors and projects on the ground. Inside the vehicle, a light bar runs along the base of the windshield that serves as a communication device. If you’re using the navigation, and you’re about to turn right, a blue light will move left to right across the width of the windshield to signal that you’re about to make a turn. It also serves as a status bar when you’re charging the vehicle. I thought it seemed gimmicky at first, but seeing it in action, I found it to be a pretty helpful effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i8qTab"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can choose from 30 different colors, so if you’re feeling kind of pink, go pink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CPbpF"&gt;And the lights are all adjustable. You can choose from 30 different colors, so if you’re feeling kind of pink, go pink. Having more of a blue day? Go for it. Are the adjustable colors necessary at all? No. Are they really fun to play around with? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRyfJl"&gt;More evidence of VW’s quirky designs are the “play” and “pause” pedals. I remember seeing these a few years ago in VW’s ID Buzz electric microbus concept and thinking they seemed really stupid. But now I think I kind of get it. You can’t call it a gas pedal when the car runs on electrons, right? So why not play and pause? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9KoIt5rBOBfIVjItd5gp2mFZ-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331956/B2247047.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dpC6GK"&gt;There are two screens, a 5.3-inch instrument cluster behind the steering wheel and a 12-inch one in the center console. It’s nice to see a pair of screens that don’t completely dominate the interior. The UX is totally fine, but for those who prefer their smartphone’s interface, the ID 4 supports both wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The screens looked great; they were bright and vibrant, and the colors really popped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOowKh"&gt;I didn’t experience an excessive amount of lagginess with the center screen, but there were a few sticky spots, especially while swiping from menu to menu. Those expecting Tesla-level responsiveness will be disappointed. The ID 4 will get over-the-air software updates, so it’s nothing that VW can’t fix in the future. We can only hope that VW has cleared up its software quality-control issues that effectively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;delayed the delivery of the ID 3 hatchback&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oSNicM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were a few sticky spots, especially while swiping from menu to menu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvuQzR"&gt;There’s a home button on the left side of the screen for easy access, and the default software felt similar enough to CarPlay that I was fine using either. The screen is also slightly angled toward the driver, which was a nice touch. That said, the ID 4’s default navigation isn’t as clean-looking as Google Maps, as is usually the case with most cars today. There aren’t many physical buttons, but the ones they have had nice haptic feedback to them that felt satisfying to the touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlPVho"&gt;The voice assistant, which is activated by saying “Hello, ID,” was much improved from the last time I drove the ID 4. It was effective at controlling the HVAC system and making other small changes, though I still found I had to repeat myself a lot. The lag time between using the wake words and issuing a command is also still too long, but I can see VW easily improving that in future iterations. Still, it isn’t as advanced as the new Volvos with native Android Auto. But I also don’t expect the German auto giant to be able to match Google’s history of developing artificial intelligence in just a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVBiId"&gt;There’s also gesture control which allows you to move between menus just by swiping your hand in front of the screen. The less said about this wonky feature, the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBgOFH"&gt;I found the driver’s seat to be very comfortable and the headroom to be expansive. The panoramic sunroof was similar to what’s found in most Teslas these days and was really a joy to sit under. The white leather in the First Edition was a nice touch, and the air vents are real air vents, with open and close knobs, so this might be the car for you if you find Tesla’s digital air vents off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hOmX33"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The less said about this wonky feature, the better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lhiOyZ"&gt;Tapping through the settings gets you to the camera feature, where you can see a simulated 360-degree image of the car from the top down but not an actual camera image of the car from that angle. You also get the view from the rear-mounted camera, which is expansive. VW uses a good amount of the screen to show you these images, which really helps when reversing or navigating tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R340xV"&gt;The ID 4 uses a front radar, front camera, two rear radars, and eight ultrasound sensors to see the world around it. The driver-assist system isn’t advanced like Tesla’s Autopilot or GM’s Super Cruise, but it does have the standard features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot detection, and pedestrian monitoring. Like most driver-assist systems, the controls aren’t very intuitive, and drivers are recommended to brush up on which buttons do what before attempting to activate it on a busy highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xenG9N"&gt;There’s no driver monitoring system, which is a bummer, but the ID 4 did show me a pop-up message on the instrument cluster reminding me to keep my hands on the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsgijDd9Tlf9RyvE-fIi8vhI34s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331995/B2247053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JZCWTW"&gt;CHARGE!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qwMCOj"&gt;The ID 4 comes with an 11 kW onboard charger that allows the ID 4 to charge to full in seven and a half hours at a home or public Level 2 charger. As with most EVs, it’s not recommended to charge the ID 4 on a normal 120-volt outlet because the rate of charging is practically glacial. There’s really no point to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4hot7"&gt;At a DC fast-charging station, with 125 kW charging, the ID 4 can go from 5 to 80 percent charged in about 38 minutes. The challenge, of course, is finding a charger that can actually provide that much power; a lot of public chargers only supply about half as many kilowatts, which will obviously make recharging the ID 4’s battery take longer than predicted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8P4OM"&gt;One of the big selling points for the ID 4 is three years of free charging with VW’s Electrify America charging network. Like Tesla, VW has skin in the game when it comes to EV charging infrastructure, which will go a long way in luring shoppers away from the warm embrace of combustion engine familiarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SaOu6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three years of free charging with VW’s Electrify America&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pftY4K"&gt;Electrify America has approximately 500 charging stations in the US, with over 2,200 DC fast chargers — though the company expects to install or have under development approximately 800 stations with about 3,500 DC fast chargers by December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzaHTG"&gt;A fast, reliable network of charging stations will go a long way in selling the ID 4 to customers. The $40,000 price tag will help, too. But it’s still going to be tough for VW to siphon buyers away from low-priced alternatives like the Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav4, both of which are in the mid-$20,000 range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SGro3L"&gt;IS THE ID 4 YOU?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cvuHGL"&gt;Volkswagen is currently the second-largest automaker in the world, having just lost the top spot to Toyota. Its first long-range, mass-market EV in the US is something to take seriously. That said, the ID 4 is not for everyone. For some, it will be too expensive. For others, it will lack the devil-may-care attitude of a Tesla or the warm fuzziness of a familiar nameplate like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhmF09"&gt;For me, it felt right. It handled great, the tech was both low-key and competent, and the joy that went into the design of the ID 4 was very tangible and effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ozqS9"&gt;The ID 3 and 4 are just the first offerings of VW’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/vw-boosts-new-technology-spending-to-66-billion-through-2024?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;$66 billion electrification push&lt;/a&gt;. Forthcoming vehicles will be based on concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a coupe version of the ID 4, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291294/vw-id5-ev-electric-suv-coupe-production-volkswagen-2021"&gt;aptly named the ID 5&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s MEB modular electric vehicle platform, which will also underpin a commercial electric vehicle from Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848460/porsche-taycan-electric-sports-car-turbo-price-specs-mile-range-reveal"&gt;Porsche recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; its first all-electric sports car, the Taycan. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;Dieselgate&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars that would help them pass government emissions tests conducted in a lab, then allow the vehicles to produce higher emissions outside of the lab. The company thought it could get away with the deception, but it got caught. Tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements later, VW has a unique opportunity to start to make real amends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BbLrDN"&gt;Volkswagen is calling the ID 4 the “most important vehicle ... since the launch of the Beetle,” and it’s apparent that the company put a lot of effort into making that true. It has a legacy in the US that it wants to maintain and a lot of baggage to overcome. Fortunately, the ID 4 is a really strong contender in a year that is going to be overloaded with electric crossovers. But if the price is any indicator, it’s going to be an uphill battle for VW’s battery-powered crossover to cross over into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gab blames reported hack of 40 million posts on ‘demon hackers’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gab" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFuFQjkW8bu61aE6gx53Yec6csA=/0x0:768x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891218/desktop_gabfidddx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMBXOl"&gt;Right-wing social media website Gab has reportedly been hacked, and CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1366123617847828483?s=20"&gt;Andrew Torba said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “demon hackers” were to blame, using a transphobic slur to describe them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxyGQ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;first reported that a hacker&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by “JaXpArO and My Little Anonymous Revival Project,” carried out the hack to expose Gab’s users. Private messages from some 15,000 Gab users were used to create a dataset of more than 40 million posts from the site, including private posts. User profiles, some users’ hashed passwords, and passwords for groups also were affected by the hack, which reportedly used a SQL injection vulnerability to siphon some 70GB of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSsOCa"&gt;Activist data transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), plans to share the data with researchers and journalists but says it is not releasing it publicly due to privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUsa2a"&gt;“In a simpler or more ordinary time, it’d be an important sociological resource,” according to a &lt;a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GabLeaks"&gt;blog post on the DDoSecrets wiki site&lt;/a&gt;. “In 2021, it’s also a record of the culture and the exact statements surrounding not only an increase in extremist views and actions, but an attempted coup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DzyjD"&gt;DDoSecrets co-founder Emma Best told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; the data was a “gold mine of research for people looking at militias, neo-Nazis, the far right, QAnon, and everything surrounding January 6,” when the US Capitol was attacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ycz1qT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Since the attack on the Capitol, Gab has seen an 800 percent spike in traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bQYi7"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; first contacted Gab about the data breach, &lt;a href="https://news.gab.com/2021/02/26/alleged-data-breach-26-february-2021/"&gt;Torba wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Gab had not confirmed what it called the “alleged breach,” telling users that if the attack had “taken place as described, your passwords have not been revealed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5r0dG1"&gt;Torba later tweeted that the company &lt;em&gt;was,&lt;/em&gt; in fact, being attacked by hackers and was investigating. He said his own account and one for former President Trump were among those compromised. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzkk7/gabs-real-donald-trump-isnt-really-donald-trump"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump account wasn’t actually affiliated with the former president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0IyrF"&gt;Since the attack on the Capitol, Gab has seen an 800 percent spike in traffic, and its registered user numbers have doubled, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/17/957512634/social-media-site-gab-is-surging-even-as-critics-blame-it-for-capitol-violence"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Anti-Defamation League has &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-calls-on-us-justice-department-to-investigate-gab-for-possible-criminal"&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Gab to determine “whether the social media platform intentionally aided or abetted” people who were involved in the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaGUyo"&gt;Torba founded Gab in 2016, styled as a free speech alternative to other social media sites. It gained notoriety in 2018 when a man posted an anti-Semitic message on the site before driving to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;Pittsburgh and killing 11 people in a synagogue&lt;/a&gt;. Gab removed the account and cooperated with investigators but was dropped by its hosting platform and PayPal. Its app was kicked out of both Google and Apple’s app stores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;violating hate speech policies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj1tXp"&gt;Gab did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart drops $35 order minimum for its two-hour delivery service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart profits jump in latest quarter during the coronavirus pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9OLknmGtwkH3HMSnu5UO9CsS_1s=/0x0:4660x3107/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891155/1268140215.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FstpUw"&gt;Walmart is dropping its $35 minimum order requirement to qualify for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243557/walmart-express-delivery-two-hour-groceries-electronics"&gt;Express two-hour delivery service&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer announced on Monday. The move puts Walmart’s e-commerce platform on better footing to compete with Amazon Prime, which has offered customers same-day delivery for certain items in specific markets through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11575076/amazon-prime-now-delivery-web-site"&gt;Prime Now service&lt;/a&gt; since 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pBHyt"&gt;Walmart’s Express service promises two-hour delivery of “Walmart’s food, consumables and general merchandise assortment,” which includes produce, pantry items, household essentials, and other products. It typically costs $10 on top of a standard delivery fee ranging from $7.95 or $9.95, but Walmart waives the delivery fee if you subscribe to its Prime-like Walmart Plus subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kKEjFU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart is catching up to Amazon in the fast delivery department&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHnLf1"&gt;Walmart Express first launched in April of last year, and the company says it’s now available in close to 3,000 locations that reach 70 percent of the US population. Following today’s announcement, Express delivery may actually be a more attractive option than Amazon’s Prime Now, which still has a $35 order limit and is restricted to certain markets. It should, however, be noted that Prime Now is free for Prime members and only $4.99 per order if you don’t meet the order minimum, making it less expensive in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqRkZn"&gt;“Many customers use Express delivery for when they’re in a pinch, whether it be a missing ingredient for a weeknight dinner or a pack of diapers,” Tom Ward, Walmart’s senior vice president of customer product, said in a statement. “Customers told us sometimes the items they needed in a hurry didn’t meet the minimum, so we’re removing it, making it even easier for customers to get what they need when they need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jit8d4"&gt;Walmart is slowly but surely catching up to the extreme convenience offered by its rival Amazon. Walmart last December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22024753/walmart-plus-35-dollar-free-shipping-minimum-removed-amazon-prime-competition"&gt;dropped a similar $35 minimum order requirement&lt;/a&gt; for its Walmart Plus free next-day and two-day shipping perk, which put Walmart Plus on par with Amazon Prime in that regard. The retailer has also been expanding its grocery delivery options to better compete with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods, both of which have been Amazon’s footholds into real-world commerce. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>President Biden denounces ‘anti-union propaganda’ ahead of Amazon union vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden arrives to the Oval Office Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, along the West Wing Colonnade of the White House. (Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/du4Y-FkA2kLlettC2EanWZhDyxU=/0x0:1599x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891084/50987557506_f0ca4ba0c9_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/50987557506/" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Schultz for White House / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MhUh98"&gt;On Sunday night, President Joe Biden released &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1366191901196644354"&gt;a message of support for unionizing Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; in Alabama, while sternly denouncing anti-union efforts by employers. The message comes in the midst of a contentious union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer. And while Biden stopped short of an explicit endorsement of the fledgling Bessemer union, he was broadly enthusiastic about the benefits of collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODFIfe"&gt;“I made it clear during my campaign that my policy would be to support unions organizing and the right to collectively bargain,” Biden said in the statement. “I’m keeping that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D4We9T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZpUD9KgYc4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvf4YN"&gt;It’s rare for a sitting president to publicly support a union drive, and the statement is careful not to direct workers to vote in favor of unionization, as such statements might violate labor law. Biden never names Amazon directly in the statement, although he does directly name Alabama warehouse workers. He also denounces anti-union efforts in a way many will see as aimed at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UE0ns"&gt;“There should be no intimidation,” Biden says in the video, “no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoZdkz"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which is organizing the Bessemer worksite, applauded the statement. “As President Biden points out, the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is by organizing into unions,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum &lt;a href="https://www.rwdsu.info/potus_bamazon"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “And that is why so many working women and men are fighting for a union at the Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4vlQe"&gt;Amazon has been aggressive in its efforts to prevent the warehouse from unionizing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;inundating Alabama workers&lt;/a&gt; with text messages and worksite posters warning of the downsides of unionization. Last week, workers spotted anti-union ads running on Amazon-owned Twitch, although Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads"&gt;withdrew the ads&lt;/a&gt; once their existence was made public. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;In another incident&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon worked with county officials to alter the timing on a stoplight near the warehouse, making it harder for organizers to approach workers as they left the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfEIUq"&gt;In some instances, those efforts have provoked a backlash against the company. Last week, Amazon’s VP overseeing labor and employment law &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/27/amazon-american-constitution-society-andrew-devore-union/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=theintercept"&gt;abruptly resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group that had recently appointed him to a three-year term. A coalition of members had &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJJVYfvVZrrO_xrae8iA2nMuXCKIpO2Z-DJskxBKAQtFdULg/viewform"&gt;called for his resignation in December&lt;/a&gt;, citing Amazon’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;a walkout at a Staten Island warehouse&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5mhOo"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LTE-enabled Apple Watch Series 5 has hit its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2JovU9TtHtz9m3797bn85KKsZg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890987/vpavic_190915_3669_0267.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kD1gB0"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 5 is seeing some big discounts at Best Buy. You can get a good deal on a standard GPS-enabled model, but I think the best deals are on the options with cellular capability. The 40mm Apple Watch Series 5 (silver aluminum case with a black-and-white Nike band) &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733671628841520237" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $319&lt;/a&gt;, down from $500, and it supports GPS and cellular networks if you pay to put it on your monthly plan. The bigger 44mm version of this colorway &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733671665301101093" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $349&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a good deal. Prices go up from there, but it’s a smart way to save compared to the cost of a newer Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUxDbM"&gt;In case you were wondering exactly how the Series 5 differs from the newer models, including the Apple Watch SE, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;check out this comparison post&lt;/a&gt; to help you decide. In short, the Series 5 is more similar to the Series 6 in terms of internal sensors, and it similarly has an always-on OLED screen, which the more affordable SE lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4431qP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10210144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b5Z16q"&gt;If you want earbuds that can easily pair to the Apple Watch, Apple’s own AirPods Pro &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-24" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are back down to $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. This low price has been around many times at this point, but who knows? Maybe the timing for this particular price drop is just right for you. These truly wireless earbuds were originally priced at $250, but most retailers sell them for around $200 these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="msEQkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9t15Zg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox One (and optimized for the Series X via Smart Delivery) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $33 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is close to half off its usual full price. Get this game if you enjoy action RPG games, especially ones filled with a strange, fun sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A5MZbE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="kYkRsK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with clock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is its usual price. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information available for $10 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $50 one, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; for $10 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, but no deals are available at this time.

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Right now, the Amazon Echo is available for purchase at its usual price of $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for the same sale price of $80.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c8b1ed4e46d21c7660ba5ae3006737b8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $65 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $105 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;There are no active deals going on right now for the Echo Show 10, but if you just want the device itself, you can get it for its usual price of $250 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kppkjv"&gt;There are, however, a few bundles going on that throw in an additional item alongside the Echo Show 10. At Amazon, can buy the Echo Show 10 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FRR5V57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 on a one-year subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Food Network Kitchen.

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, is designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a tenth-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is its usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for the usual price of $110. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; also have a promotion where you can receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=245b190dc0183c0524d2fca4e15ce6fe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. Amazon is also running a promotion where you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FPX819Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save 20 percent off on any two eligible Kindle devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. You can grab one for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its normal price of $110&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available, but if you want to buy one in the near future, the Kindle Paperwhite is on sale for the price it usually tends to sell for; you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want an ad-free model, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this configuration for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/18/5915039/amazons-all-you-can-read-kindle-unlimited-is-now-official-at-9-99-per"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon also discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $160&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50C1xWX4q-mLYmoXmHAKkoXLX1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18329976/akrales_190723_3560_0055.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads on the lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, you can grab one of the many configurations plus three free months of Kindle Unlimited for the normal price starting at $250. The ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the one without ads is $270. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt;, or for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;without ads&lt;/a&gt; configuration, you can buy it for $300. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage at Amazon for $320 ($9 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt; (in stock on April 4th), which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as $385 at Amazon (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; in gold only.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $530, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors on sale&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from $549 to $565 depending on the color you select. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Rose-Gold%2F149437127%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;. You can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BD9FH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,049&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon in silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399&lt;/a&gt; in both colors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DyhcNt"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFo3y1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatepa.org/"&gt;VaccinatePA&lt;/a&gt; uses a team of volunteers to call hospitals and pharmacies for information on where appointments are available, where you can get on a waitlist, and whom to contact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated toward helping people find COVID vaccinations. Currently, VaccineFinder is only available for people in Alaska, Tennessee, Indiana, and Iowa, but according to the site, it should be adding more providers in other states over the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Milla Jovovich wanted Monster Hunter viewers to feel ‘like they were playing the game for the first time’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWkAy71AyAj1DJFfbmSSmOcfHpU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890686/MH_00812_2000x1333_thumbnail.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuDTrj"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, Milla Jovovich plays an outsider. Her character, a US Army ranger named Artemis, is mysteriously transported from our world to a fantastical realm filled with giant and dangerous monsters. American soldiers aren’t something you’ll find in any of Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games. But Jovovich believes Artemis helped provide an important perspective — almost serving as a stand-in for a player jumping into their first experience with a &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqDXdu"&gt;“When my character gets transported into the &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; world I was able to see it with the same eyes as when I first saw the game,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I was just like ‘Whoa, it’s so beautiful.’ We really wanted people to feel like that when they watch the movie, like they were playing the game for the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGKpKC"&gt;Jovovich says she was introduced to the franchise through her husband, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; director Paul W.S. Anderson, who “had been really obsessed with this property for over 10 years.” Eventually he got the rights to the franchise, and went through a few iterations of a script. But it wasn’t until rewriting the story to have Jovovich as the lead that things really clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nIQIuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I really liked the dual blades.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1e5wF"&gt;There was also something about the fictional universe that spoke to her. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a typical kaiju story with giant creatures destroying the world. You wouldn’t mistake it for Godzilla. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16955336/monster-hunter-world-creature-design-interview"&gt;it’s about a place where humanity is deeply invested in the natural world around them&lt;/a&gt;. In the games, you don’t just hunt monsters to kill them; you use them to craft food, weapons, and other items. It’s all about survival, and it gives Monster Hunter its own distinct vibe compared to other action games, with slow, methodical gameplay based on careful planning and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8m712"&gt;“I really like that feeling of having to use every part of the animal, and there’s no waste,” Jovovich says. There are even scenes in the film where downed monsters are put to good use, just like in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlE2c4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqQVtMbbTOM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W4sbG"&gt;She says she was able to better understand this aspect of the universe by playing&lt;em&gt; Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;. This experience also helped inform her character’s fighting style. In the movie, Artemis joins forces with a local hunter, played by Tony Jaa, and the two have very different techniques. Jaa wields a massive glaive, whereas Artemis eventually adopts a pair of twin blades (which at one point are lit on fire). “I really liked the dual blades, and there are certain moves that go with the dual blades that we wanted to film,” she explains. But those two distinct fighting styles weren’t the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okyLA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re always going to have to make certain sacrifices.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvQ1m0"&gt;“I felt at the beginning like our fighting styles were too similar, in the sense that the choreographer was giving me some really cool-looking moves, but they just felt too film martial artsy,” Jovovich says. “I was like, I just feel like my character wouldn’t be able to do a butterfly kick. That’s not her training. Her training as a soldier would be much more close-combat … Whereas the martial arts that Tony does is so much more cinematic and beautiful. I felt like it was good to let him do that stuff, and then for us to have very different fighting styles. Because it’s more realistic, but also I thought it was more interesting for our characters as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AcuJDo"&gt;Adapting an existing property is always a tricky proposition. Fans come with preconceived expectations, and it can be tough to meet those while also making things accessible for new audiences. It’s something that Jovovich and Anderson are experienced with, having worked together on the long-running &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series, which also happens to be based on a Capcom game. The new movie provided a slightly different challenge. Since the release of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019"&gt;the franchise is as popular as it’s ever been&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still not exactly a household name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eVoGz"&gt;“When you’re dealing with a 90 minute version of something, you’re always going to have to make certain sacrifices,” she explains. “If this was &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; the TV show, it would be very different. You would have a lot more time to spend on little details. The most important thing for us when making a movie was to have the spirit of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSIabH"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Monster Hunter &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available to purchase digitally now and will be out on Blu-Ray and DVD starting March 2nd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
