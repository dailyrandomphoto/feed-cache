    <title>Western Digital doubles the storage in its portable SSDs to 4TB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ki4Dpnl_YcWLBsSWUNJkFjLl2PE=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651809/WD_4tb_ssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ouv9KO"&gt;Western Digital is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F2021-01-11-western-digital-delivers-unmatched-line-up-of-high-capacity-portable-ssds&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225044%2Fwestern-digital-portable-ssds-storage-4tb-price-announced#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;doubling the maximum storage size&lt;/a&gt; of several of its portable SSDs to 4TB. Previously, Western Digital’s SSD lineup maxed out at 2TB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtAgGE"&gt;The 4TB storage configuration will be available under Western Digital’s My Passport and WD_Black black brands, along with its subsidiary SanDisk’s Extreme series. All of the products will also include a five-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcCw24"&gt;Starting at $680, Western Digital’s My Passport SSD, which received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/20/21376091/western-digital-my-passport-ssd-portable-storage-backup-second-gen-faster"&gt;model refresh last August&lt;/a&gt;, promises up to 1050MB/s read speeds and 1000MB/s write speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THuwtQrJtr0xZn2WCZCYfKHYNvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227999/WD_Black_P50_TopOrtho_LightOn_3.jpg.thumb.840.840.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD is great for console gamers looking for an external device to store their games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n3cM1c"&gt;Western Digital’s Black P50 Game Drive SSD 4TB configuration will retail for $750 and include read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. This external SSD is compatible with PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKoVKE"&gt;But buyer beware: if you are looking to buy this as an external SSD to supplement the storage on your PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, there are a few caveats. It can connect to the PS5, but you can only store PS4 games. And while it will work on the Xbox Series X / S, this game drive is not compatible with the next-gen console's SSD expansion output to take full advantage of the next-gen hardware. Currently, the one SSD that takes full advantage of the Series X / S’s hardware is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181854/microsoft-xbox-series-x-expansion-cards-removable-storage-support-features"&gt;Seagate’s Expansion Card&lt;/a&gt;, which only comes in 1TB. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEZmsgECEmfYYVy3b-sjgFROr8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21923934/SanDisk_Extreme_Portable_SSD_Front_HR.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SanDisk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the SanDisk Extreme and Extreme Pro received a model refresh last September.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4RD1x"&gt;The SanDisk Extreme’s 4TB configuration will cost $700 and promises transfer speeds of up to 1050MB/s read and 1000MB/s write. An even faster option, the 4TB Extreme Pro, will cost $900 and delivers both read and write transfer speeds of up to 2000MB/s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UKJ7a"&gt;Western Digital says all of these products are expected to launch “later this calendar quarter” on its website and the Western Digital website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spanish Fortnite streamer TheGrefg has broken the individual record for highest concurrents on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSLNVJ4MkNm_mgwNo8yvs4UHNRA=/113x0:1328x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_2.49.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTdRMe"&gt;Today, Spanish streamer and EU Heretics team owner &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegrefg"&gt;David “TheGrefg” Martínez is showing off his Icon series &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin&lt;/a&gt;. With just over an hour to the reveal, it appears that Martínez has smashed the individual concurrent record on Twitch, with more than 780,000 live viewers. (By way of comparison: Seattle had 753,675 residents as of the 2019 census.) His excitement was palpable, and viewers watched live as Martínez googled the records on his record-breaking stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12UEPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Icon Series skins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;are reserved for the game’s top creators&lt;/a&gt;, which include people like Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten and Tyler “Ninja” Blevins. As of this writing, &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Icon_Series_Outfits"&gt;there are only seven outfits in the series&lt;/a&gt;; Martínez’s would be the 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icQATF"&gt;Martínez takes the individual concurrent record from Blevins, who previously had the record for the highest number of concurrents on an individual stream, at 635,000, &lt;a href="https://www.ginx.tv/en/fortnite/thegrefg-s-fortnite-galactus-stream-becomes-most-watched-in-twitch-history"&gt;set in March 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Though this isn’t the first time that Martínez has broken Blevins’ record: he hit 660,000 live viewers during December’s big &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;event. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0LQEtKWhLDkKqCyM37jlAATz2M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651597/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pddNHN"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event will kick off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th at 10AM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to copious leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the big day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbAnaA"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its next lineup of flagship phones, which will likely be called the S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra. The S21 Ultra is rumored to have top-of-the-line specs, cameras, and, in a first for an S-model Galaxy phone, support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The S21 and S21 Plus are expected to have similar specs but differentiate in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9FUl"&gt;A new set of true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and a Tile-like item tracker, the Galaxy SmartTag, also seem like a lock. Rumors about both products have hit the web recently, and they each showed up in a leaked preorder ad for the S21 Ultra. And of course, Samsung may surprise us with things that we don’t know about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJz7gG"&gt;Here’s the rundown of what we think we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TqiJEm"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra will support the S Pen stylus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkXzfavWpoqmOlrYslGSJLU78-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226167/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_1608287647_0_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U8SR"&gt;Let’s talk about the Ultra flagship first. The big new feature for the S21 Ultra is support for the S Pen stylus, as confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt;. However, the stylus is rumored to be an optional accessory, and the phone isn’t rumored to have a dedicated slot to store it, unlike the company’s Note series of phones. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; images of an optional case that allows you to store the S Pen, though, so that might be a useful accessory to pick up to help you not lose the stylus. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the S Pen will cost just under €40, which translates to just under $49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1dLQd"&gt;As for cameras, the Ultra will apparently have four back cameras, including 3X &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10X telephoto cameras, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those telephoto cameras are also expected to have optical image stabilization and a 10-megapixel resolution. The phone may also have Samsung’s 100X “Space Zoom” feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132870/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-zoom-100x-space-optical-hybrid-digital-periscope"&gt;first debuted in the Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcHFUh"&gt;The other two back cameras are rumored to be a 108-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the selfie camera may be 40 megapixels. The phone could also have laser-assisted autofocus, something that was included with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79T64A"&gt;You can get a closer look at the rumored camera setup for the Ultra in this leaked marketing image from &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sbIgPT9D6CoctREkRbWIPbYY-W4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226069/bc3f842f7c28229dc0a4f3c0a3ee56515a329ca4c584263619b42029192c67a1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rumored cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDMfVq"&gt;The Ultra is also expected to have a 6.8-inch WQHD+ (3200 x 1440) resolution display, according to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also expected to support a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1346342403792273413"&gt;leaker Ice Universe&lt;/a&gt; says the S21 Ultra may be able to run at that full WQHD+ resolution with the 120Hz refresh rate, something that the S20 Ultra couldn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWM6E3"&gt;The S21 Ultra is also rumored to support 5G networks, be IP68 certified for water and dust resistance, have a 5,000mAh battery, and come with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a7lbvG"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will offer similar specs at different sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSMaghhXENSxKlIePS1XTqEfCNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226095/42240.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14BTZ"&gt;Samsung also plans to announce the Samsung S21 and S21 Plus, which won’t have quite as powerful specs as the Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SIeKj"&gt;The most obvious difference between the S21 and S21 Plus is a smaller camera module. The two phones are expected to have a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And both phones will reportedly have a 10-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jhke"&gt;Here’s a better look at the cameras on the S21, thanks to another leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143"&gt;from Blass&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yhor9DKX7P2whgS81d6AC-kqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226116/e621085f8ae9e2b7f52b30e774a0648f163650b16b9f84df9afe07c77759bbd3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-camera-infographics-1609777211-1473703143" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus’ rumored camera setups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddghEu"&gt;As for screens, the standard S21 is expected to have a 6.2-inch display with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution, while the S21 Plus is rumored to have a 6.7-inch screen with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. Both are expected to support a 120Hz refresh rate screen as well, though it apparently won’t be an adaptive refresh rate, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="117x1F"&gt;Like the Ultra, both the S21 and S21 Plus are expected to support 5G networks and be IP68-certified. They’re also expected to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. And depending on which model you buy, they’ll have different battery sizes: the smaller S21 is rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery, while the S21 Plus is expected to have a 4,800mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py3yCA"&gt;Each phone is also rumored to have a different back cover material. The S21 could have a plastic back, while the S21 Plus may have a glass back, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OG7VjD"&gt;The S21 lineup may not include a power charger in the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q72Bf7"&gt;Samsung’s newest phones may take a cue from Apple by not including a charger in the box, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s reports about the &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;S21, S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. And the company recently deleted ads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;mocking Apple&lt;/a&gt; for not including a charger with the iPhone 12 lineup, lending credence to rumors that Samsung will be making a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meFNfx"&gt;While the decision could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;a good one for the environment&lt;/a&gt;, keep in mind that if you’re thinking about picking up an S21, you may also need to consider purchasing a separate charging brick to go along with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCf341"&gt;The new phones may run Samsung’s One UI 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj3VlO"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup may run One UI 3.1, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aD3a6gHZeQ"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Jimmy is Promo reveals some of the features that could be coming in the new update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TBEzw3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aD3a6gHZeQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRol9y"&gt;The video, which apparently demonstrates One UI 3.1 running on the S21 Ultra, shows off a way to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, some of the S Pen features that work on the S21 Ultra, backgrounds for the call screen, the ability to select video resolution from the video recording screen, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvS9V2"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds could compete with the AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s rumored Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Det9wn"&gt;In addition to its S21 slate of phones, Samsung is also heavily rumored to announce a new set of true wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro. Not only have they been revealed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221020/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-smarttags-s21-ultra-pre-order-january-14th"&gt;preorder freebie&lt;/a&gt; for the S21 Ultra in a leaked marketing render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;shared by Blass&lt;/a&gt;, but YouTuber Digital Slang has already posted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;hands-on video&lt;/a&gt; and comparisons with the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GDIfgKm0Zeg"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9cJJVFJkFgU"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NtfL99"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGUMP0xsio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3prOX"&gt;The new earbuds are rumored to have active noise cancelation, an eight-hour battery life (up to 28 hours with the charging case), and an IPX7 water / sweat rating. You can see how the Galaxy Buds Pro compare to some of Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds in this leaked spec sheet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro may cost $199, making them a more affordable alternative to $249 Apple’s AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hLHE2"&gt;Samsung may launch its Tile-like item tracker called the Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJQ7mSqcubi_fODBqbacWlaryb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208211/smarttagleak.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9flwoY"&gt;Samsung’s rumored new Tile-like Galaxy SmartTag will apparently use Bluetooth to connect with devices and share its location. The tag itself looks to be a small square with rounded corners and a loop at the top to make it easier to attach to things, as shown in photos posted on the website of Taiwan’s telecom regulator &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;and shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The design in the photos also matches an image of the SmartTag in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;leaked ad&lt;/a&gt; of preorder bonuses for the S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izd5pO"&gt;It seems likely that the SmartTags will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;Samsung’s new SmartThings Find app&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you track the locations of your Galaxy devices, similar to Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s second-gen ultrasonic fingerprint reader is bigger and faster than the original</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLJTb5TnY3zgOeiE3jFJfOC6Ulo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651590/akrales_190228_3255_0065.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2MjdJq"&gt;Qualcomm has just announced the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, the latest version of its ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor that looks to improve on the original model in nearly every way. The new version offers a larger surface area for the sensor and faster processing to unlock phones even quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Zuro"&gt;The company is making a big jump here: the new Gen 2 model measures 8mm x 8mm, compared to the 4mm x 9mm surface area of the first-generation model, for 77 percent more surface area. In turn, that means it’ll be easier to accurately place your finger on the sensor, and it allows for the sensor to collect more data with each scan. By combining the larger sensor with faster processing, Qualcomm promises that scanning a fingerprint to unlock a phone will go 50 percent faster with the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up4e1BMF_zgWS-2RlhNPuE9KKFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225984/3D_Sonic_Sensor_Gen_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCM3Mj"&gt;Qualcomm’s first-generation ultrasonic sensor — the 3D Sonic Sensor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;made its debut in the Galaxy S10 lineup of phones in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, nearly every other in-display reader used an optical scanner, which was said to be slower and less reliable than the new ultrasonic one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmQLD3"&gt;But the reality turned out to be the opposite: the first-generation 3D Sonic Sensor ran into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/7/18299366/samsung-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-sensor-fooled-3d-printed-fingerprint"&gt;numerous issues&lt;/a&gt;, including a highly problematic security flaw that caused the readers to unlock phones with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919026/samsung-galaxy-s10-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensor-security-flaw-screen-cover-protector"&gt;almost any fingerprint&lt;/a&gt; when used with some screen protectors. (Samsung would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929178/samsung-galaxy-s10-note-1o-fingerprint-recognition-issue-patch-ultrasonic-sensor"&gt;fix the problem&lt;/a&gt; with a software update.) And the company &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-20-fingerprint-reader-fooled-screen-protectors/"&gt;recently issued&lt;/a&gt; another patch for the Galaxy Note 20 lineup, addressing similar screen protector problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUoTUt"&gt;The new sensor is technically the third under-display ultrasonic fingerprint reader from Qualcomm, following the original 3D Sonic Sensor and the 3D Sonic Max (introduced in 2019) — which was effectively just a much larger version of the first-gen sensor, but it lacked any real speed improvements. While the 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2 doesn’t quite match the 3D Sonic Max’s sensor (which measured a whopping 20mm x 30mm) in size, the speed improvements should more than make up for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeEriI"&gt;Qualcomm says that the first phones to feature that new 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2 should be available in “early 2021.” The company doesn’t mention any partners or more specific timing in its announcement, but it’s worth noting that Samsung is expected to announce its latest Galaxy S21 devices on January 14th. Samsung is the biggest customer for Qualcomm’s ultrasonic fingerprint readers so far, having previously used them in its S10, Note 10, S20, and Note 20 lineups for the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC settles with photo storage app that pivoted to facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JX0iqJ2Xr7lhXU-tOPQeIT9HFhY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651587/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xZT0O"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has reached a settlement with photo storage app Ever that it says used customers’ photos to develop facial recognition technology without telling them, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/california-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-deceived-consumers"&gt;the agency announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wgdcd"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/everalbum_order.pdf"&gt;terms of the agreement&lt;/a&gt;, Everalbum Inc. is required to delete photos and videos of its users who deactivated their accounts, as well as any facial recognition algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos. The company also must delete all “face embeddings,” which it describes as “data reflecting facial features that can be used for facial recognition purposes” that were derived from users’ photos who didn’t give consent for their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEB8AY"&gt;Everalbum, which &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"&gt;shut down Ever in August and rebranded itself as Paravision AI&lt;/a&gt;, is also prohibited from misrepresenting how it collects and uses personal information and how it protects users’ privacy. If it markets software to consumers for personal use, the company has to obtain express consent before using any biometric information it collects from users to create face embeddings or to develop facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyjqkK"&gt;In a 2019 report, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; detailed how Ever&lt;/a&gt; launched as a cloud storage business in 2013, but then switched to be a facial recognition technology provider four years later because it realized its photo app “wasn’t going to be a venture-scale business.” The report found that the Ever app was using customer’s private photos to train its facial recognition algorithm, which it then sold to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92kiAV"&gt;The company said at the time that it never shared personal user data. Its privacy policy said “Your files may be used to help improve and train our products and these technologies,” but with little detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AC4YI"&gt;Photo services often use facial recognition to classify photos — &lt;a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/google-gets-sued-over-face-recognition-joining-facebook-shutterfly-battle-over-2330278"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11605068/facebook-photo-tagging-lawsuit-biometric-privacy"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/16/11934456/apple-google-facial-recognition-photos-privacy-faceprint"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; have all been criticized in the past for their systems over privacy concerns — and large &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18564043/photo-storage-app-ever-facial-recognition-secretly-trained-ai"&gt;photo databases are often used&lt;/a&gt; by companies to train their facial recognition algorithms. Still, those services request extensive permissions from the user, and it’s extremely rare for a photo service to pivot entirely into facial recognition without notifying users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqMuqo"&gt;According to the FTC, Everalbum told users that it would delete photos and videos of users who deactivated their accounts, but the agency said the company had failed to do so through at least October 2019, instead retaining them indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVRFka"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Paravision spokesperson said the FTC order “reflects a change that has already taken place,” and the company has “no plans to run a consumer business moving forward.” Paravision’s face recognition model does not use any Ever users’ data, the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0sEKK"&gt;“Face recognition and computer vision technology have the potential to improve our lives in profound ways and we take the gravity of its impacts extremely seriously,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Paravision has been &lt;a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html"&gt;recognized&lt;/a&gt; as an “accurate provider” of face recognition technology. “We look forward to maintaining this position with our latest generation model, and are deeply committed to the ethical development and use of this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ad-supported Hulu is only $2 for college students </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="handmaids-tale" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vSauZXE7sNq3qWdYWMOElV9UlA=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651477/the-handmaids-tale.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTvRkm"&gt;Keeping up with every single streaming service is an expensive affair, but Hulu is offering US college students a special discounted &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstudent&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225329%2Fhulu-college-student-discount-ads-watch-party-offline-download#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plan at $2 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, Hulu’s ad-supported plan costs $5.99 a month. The new student plan, which is an evergreen offer and will run for the same price as long as students can verify their continued enrollment, offers more than a 65 percent discount. Students can sign up for the offer now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBrUEO"&gt;Hulu has made offers like this in the past for general subscribers (not just college students), but those were limited time deals. Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/11/26/black-friday-2020-hulu-black-friday-deal-too-good-miss/6431679002/"&gt;Black Friday sale&lt;/a&gt;, for example, saw the cost go down to $2 a month for an entire year. These are all for ad-supported plans, though. Hulu’s ad-free plan remains much more costly, coming in at $11.99 a month and putting it on the same pricing shelf as Netflix ($13.99 a month for its most popular plan) and HBO Max ($14.99 a month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdAW28"&gt;Still, for college students just looking to watch new FX shows on Hulu or dig into bad reality TV or procedural drama marathons, it’s a pretty good deal. Hulu also now allows people to join in on watch parties, which allow subscribers to watch shows and movies together while apart. The only downside (other than having to deal with ads) is that Hulu’s discounted tier doesn’t allow offline viewing, so don’t expect to watch episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;on the go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market just had its first big growth in 10 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DK-er7w1oD9USCb_UkXS5toOnwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651435/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7x3ku"&gt;The PC was supposed to die 10 years ago, but it’s just experienced its first big growth in a decade. Market research firm &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-pc-market-Q4-2020?ctid=1906-7fad0e51797053191ee1cfe45c29812b"&gt;Canalys reports&lt;/a&gt; that PC shipments reached 297 million units in 2020, up an impressive 11 percent from 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47274421"&gt;IDC puts the year&lt;/a&gt; at 302 million shipments, up 13.1 percent year over year. Either way, it’s clear 2020 was a big year for PCs and the biggest growth we’ve seen since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aeyohg"&gt;PC shipments are up thanks to demand related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Supply constraints made it difficult to buy a new laptop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21279633/laptop-pc-shortages-supply-chain-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;halfway through the year&lt;/a&gt;, and demand continued throughout 2020. “Demand is pushing the PC market forward and all signs indicate this surge still has a way to go,” says IDC’s Ryan Reith. While home working and remote learning have been big drivers, people are also turning to PCs and laptops for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPXjA6y9G00Ngvbdd2U88wTKSDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22046476/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air with M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CnkPD6"&gt;“The obvious drivers for last year’s growth centered around work from home and remote learning needs, but the strength of the consumer market should not be overlooked,” says Reith. “We continue to see gaming PCs and monitor sales at all-time highs and Chrome-based devices are expanding beyond education into the consumer market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dfd9F"&gt;There were other signs throughout 2020 that PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319750/pc-shipments-coronavirus-pandemic-idc-gartner-q2-2020"&gt;shipments were surging&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft declared “the PC is back” at the beginning of the pandemic, and the company also saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;big jump in Windows usage&lt;/a&gt; after reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support"&gt;1 billion Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft also adjusted its Windows 10X plans as a result of the pandemic and increased PC demand. 10X was originally supposed to launch on dual-screen devices, but Microsoft is now planning to launch the OS variant on single-screen laptop devices first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQoHuR"&gt;PCs were central to how companies quickly went digital or allowed workers to continue remotely in 2020. “The digital transformation the world has undertaken over the past year is unparalleled, and PCs were at the heart of this change,” says Canalys research director Rushabh Doshi. “It is going to be extremely difficult to write off the PC as some of us did a few years ago. PCs are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev0wKy"&gt;I’ve long argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/9/9115503/post-pc-is-just-pc"&gt;there’s no such thing as a “post-PC” era&lt;/a&gt;, and 2020 certainly proved how valuable laptops and PCs are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3AlLI"&gt;Canalys and IDC both agree that Lenovo was the top PC vendor in 2020, followed by HP in second place, and Dell in third. Apple also saw impressive growth with its shipments up 17 percent, according to Canalys, or as high as 29 percent based on IDC’s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5e7pK"&gt;Apple has also impressed reviewers and industry experts with its new Arm-based M1 chip. It puts the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air back at the top&lt;/a&gt; of laptop recommendations and will set the stage for a battle of laptop processors for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>D-Link made a USB adapter that adds Wi-Fi 6 to your laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="D-Link Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ni7mhrmg-5OuNO55XOaBveaoD9w=/0x0:1659x1106/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651194/DWA_X1850_A1_Image_L_Side_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: D-Link&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1pFirI"&gt;D-Link is trying to make it simple to give your computer a Wi-Fi upgrade. The networking company has announced what it’s calling an “industry-first” Wi-Fi 6 adapter built into a USB stick. Plug it into your laptop or desktop computer, and you may be able to get better performance than from your older Wi-Fi chip. The adapter advertises speeds up to 1,200Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krvSE2"&gt;It’s not entirely clear who the target audience is for this upgrade. You’ll need to be connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router to get the biggest benefits, and most people still don’t own one of those (the Wi-Fi 6 standard only started rolling out two years ago). And if the laptop or desktop you’re using was bought any time in recent memory, chances are it supports Wi-Fi 5, which isn’t a huge step down from Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q6rZka"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6: is it really that much faster? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Q99vXE"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 does come with some benefits, though. Devices that support it can communicate with routers more efficiently, which can lead to improved performance across a network. Wi-Fi 6 devices also support more secure connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyTXBZ"&gt;The adapter will be available in the second quarter of 2021 for $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auBjq4"&gt;D-Link is also announcing two new Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers, both of which look a little like air purifiers. The higher end model, the AI M32, is a dual-band mesh system promising speeds up to 3.2 Gbps. Below that, D-Link is introducing the DIR-LX1870, which should offer combined connection speeds of around 1,800Mbps. The AI M32 will sell for $250 starting in the third quarter of 2021; the DIR-LX1870 launches right away for $130.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjzckZ"&gt;There are plenty of routers being announced this week as part of CES 2021. This year’s big new upgrade is routers with support for Wi-Fi 6E, a huge upgrade to Wi-Fi that quadruples the available airwaves on which they can broadcast. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22213115/tp-link-wifi-6e-first-routers-mesh-smart-speaker"&gt;TP-Link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21967423"&gt;Netgear&lt;/a&gt; have announced high-end routers with support for the new tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is blocking the #StopTheSteal hashtag from being created or used</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nb5dU7WXZEcdDaQHizER9hXfgW8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651149/akrales_190328_3240_0067.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5O59B"&gt;Peloton, a company known for its internet-connected bikes and treadmills, is wading into the Stop The Steal mess. The company is now preventing users from creating a #StopTheSteal tag from within the app, saying the tag does not “meet our guidelines” when a user goes to create it. Peloton’s &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/community-user-content-moderation-policy"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; specifically ban “hate, offensive, and obscene speech” as well as “bullying, harassment, and other offensive behavior.” We’ve reached out for additional clarification about when Peloton began blocking this hashtag and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02y0y6"&gt;Tags on Peloton function as community identifiers. When people join a tag, it appears under their name on the company’s leaderboard during workouts, and they can socialize with other members of that tag. Anyone can create a tag, and new tags are popping up in response to the #StopTheSteal ban. Groups like #StopTheSteall, #StopTheSteel, #StopTheCensorship, and #StopTheFraud are all marked as “new” in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjONlL"&gt;This isn’t the first time Peloton has had to ban potentially inciting phrases. Last year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pelotonmembers/permalink/2466394960330979/"&gt;banned political talk&lt;/a&gt; from its official Facebook groups as well as QAnon-related tags, offering up the same community guidelines message. Although the app doesn’t allow for live chatting with people in a class, the tags still share specific messages. The #BlueLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter tags are still allowed within the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWJalB"&gt;Other tech companies have also moved to limit this hashtag’s reach. Instagram allows the hashtag to exist on the platform but only shows “top” posts for it, not the most recent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler sues Amazon for kicking it off the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqGLYivMm-eRVTe1uTB2E8ilZDU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68651083/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzGDc7"&gt;The creators of social network Parler have &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20447716-parler-v-amazon"&gt;sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for ending a web hosting agreement after last week’s riot at the US Capitol. Parler claims Amazon Web Services severed ties to stop Parler from competing with the larger social platform Twitter, and it’s asking a court to stop Amazon from shutting down its account — arguing that an extended shutdown would be like “pulling the plug on a hospital patient on life support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRLI1y"&gt;Parler bills itself as a more permissive alternative to Facebook and Twitter, particularly as those sites have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;cracked down on President Donald Trump and his supporters&lt;/a&gt; for seeking to violently overturn the US election results. That stance has earned backlash from digital infrastructure companies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the Parler app from their stores, limiting its reach. Amazon dealt an even more fatal blow when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;kicked Parler off AWS&lt;/a&gt;, taking the site down altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CVvj8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon cited 98 examples of speech that incited violence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="urE0ND"&gt;The lawsuit sheds some light on Amazon’s rationale for banning Parler. &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20447717-parler-complaint-exhibit-a"&gt;In an email&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s moderation team says it is “troubled” by repeated policy violations. The email cites 98 posts that incite violence. It includes screenshots of a call to hang “traitors,” as well as an exhortation to “start systematicly assasinating [sic]” liberal leaders, supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, and others in January — with a note that “I already have a news worthy event planned.” Amazon said publicly that it “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kYIqk"&gt;AWS is the world’s largest cloud service provider, controlling approximately &lt;a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/"&gt;one-third of the market&lt;/a&gt;, followed by competitors like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Parler argues that getting kicked off AWS was a “death knell” for the site, since it’s been unable to find another host. And it claims Amazon made the call to protect Twitter, since the two companies &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-taps-aws-for-its-latest-foray-into-the-public-cloud/"&gt;signed a multiyear deal&lt;/a&gt; for web services last year. It also says it was banned because of “political animus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iz08fM"&gt;Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have questioned the power of infrastructure providers to suppress speech online. “It’s understandable that no company would want to be associated with the repellant speech that is now rampant,” ACLU attorney Ben Wizner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1348674438045298690"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; Davey Alba. Nonetheless, “there will be times when large majorities of people want to repel speech that is genuinely important. So I think we should encourage, in a broad sense, companies like Amazon to embrace neutrality principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xg4K8r"&gt;As a private company, however, Amazon has broad legal latitude to cut off customers. It’s also not necessarily responsible for Parler’s difficulty in finding a new host. While the suit says AWS’s public statements about moderation have “made Parler a pariah,” activists were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;already pressuring companies&lt;/a&gt; to cut ties with the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Ijxj"&gt;Parler’s lawsuit echoes a similar complaint by Gab, another social network favored by far-right figures. Gab sued Google in 2017 for kicking it off the Play Store, claiming it amounted to anti-competitive behavior. However, it &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171024/17465038476/gab-drops-lawsuit-against-google-considers-trying-hand-lobbying.shtml"&gt;dropped the suit&lt;/a&gt; after Google allowed it to resubmit the app for review.&lt;/p&gt;
