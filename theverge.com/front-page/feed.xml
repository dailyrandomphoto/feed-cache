    <title>Dell’s Concept Stanza converts your chicken scratch to digital text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker holds the Dell Concept Stanza in their left hand in portrait mode at a white marble table in a cafe setting. On the screen are some drawings and notes. In their right hand is a black stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW0lH-srKEIieThxb6c_FZ5tdx4=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277284/Concept_Stanza___lifestyle_image___over_shoulder___embargoed_until_Dec_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar234k"&gt;Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let’s be honest) may never actually come out — but it’s a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that’s meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they’ll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSK333"&gt;Now, this is obviously not a revolutionary use case — devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Notes&lt;/a&gt; can convert handwritten notes to digital ones already. But the big difference with the Stanza is that it’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;for writing — there are no cameras, speakers, or ports on the device, in an effort to create what Dell describes as a “distraction-free experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy6yaj"&gt;Dell’s tablet can also recognize more than letters. You can draw a line through text to delete it and can theoretically digitize shapes (such as Venn diagrams) as well. Separately, the Stanza can serve as an external monitor to extend your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Concept Stanza mounted horizontally on a stand with the stylus magnetically attached to the top, on a desk with a cup of pens and a row of notebooks in the background. The screen displays BioFrame 2.0 software." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PymGJgdq4gVXkxZTmeWfXHeI2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098700/Concept_Stanza___docked___embargoed_until_Dec_15.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s the stylus, magnetically attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRfjb9"&gt;I got to try the Stanza out for a few brief minutes. It was a comfortable writing experience — the stylus is compact and the tablet’s screen is smooth. The device correctly interpreted all of my (fairly messy) writing. In English, that is — though we were told that the device is supposed to support a whole bunch of languages, I tried writing some things in Chinese and Korean characters that it did not recognize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EsY8B"&gt;So, work in progress. Since the Stanza is still in the concept stage, there’s no pricing and availability yet, and no guarantee that it’s going to become a real thing you can buy. But it could certainly be a nifty tool for boardroom and classroom use. It’s the rare concept device that I think seems pretty ready to go — though I hope it figures out how to do multiple languages at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People spent 15 hours roleplaying a McDonald’s drive-thru on Twitter Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="England Relaxes Strictest Aspects Of Coronavirus Lockdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_PCiRCEyvWxwu_7zZxn6JysMao=/5x0:4180x2783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277200/1243414240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Burstow/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDmuh6"&gt;I didn’t think I’d spend the first two hours of my morning listening to people place orders at an imaginary McDonald’s drive-thru. And yet that’s exactly what I did thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXNISQ"&gt;Twitter user Julee, whose handle is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit"&gt;@thequeensbit&lt;/a&gt;, spent hours roleplaying as a McDonald’s cashier to an audience of thousands of listeners. At the time I joined the conversation, she was on hour 13 with more than 1,700 people tuned in. She approved one user to speak at a time as the customer. The customer would then put in their order, often incorrectly, or make absurd requests for food that’s not on the menu. One person asked for “the cookies, and put it in milk in a bowl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mLbStb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;welcome to mcdonald’s may i take ur order ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa"&gt;https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julee (@thequeensbit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit/status/1470914796925165573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hYfrzy"&gt;Julee almost always goes along with the bit even though that’s led her into some strange storylines of handing out bags of fries, selling marijuana with orders, or sorting out drama between customers and other “employees.” One customer asked for a “Sprite, extra spicy,” and “a bag just filled with BTS sauce.” Julee happily obliged. Another asked her to put a Big Mac through a paper shredder to make the meat more akin to Arby’s roast beef. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xSFbT"&gt;After nearly two hours of listening, I’ve heard customers threaten robbery, order cuisines not normally served at McDonald’s, cry over spouses who have left them, and complain about the several-hour line that exists outside of this nonexistent McDonald’s. For the most part, people seem committed to the bit. Julee is the one to break character the most, lamenting her missed therapy appointment or spending a moment celebrating the length of time the Space has continued going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7j3s1V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Next level performance Art   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i"&gt;https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jason@calacanis.com (@Jason) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1471044669639311362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5LiWtd"&gt;What made this Space so captivating is, frankly, its weirdness. Many of Twitter’s live audio rooms are hosted by journalists or business leaders who want to speak with others in their industry about niche or newsworthy topics. Yet Julee has captivated an audience of over 1,000 listeners by playing pretend. While this is outside of the norm for Twitter Spaces, some strange rooms have popped up on Clubhouse, too, like people roleplaying a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;VIPs-only Mansion Party&lt;/a&gt; or, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vd7y/inside-the-clubhouse-room-where-people-moan-like-whales"&gt;pretending to be whales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBcjVD"&gt;The Space promised to be a 24-hour drive-thru, but unfortunately it shut down this morning — apparently it crashed — sometime around the 15-hour mark. It was a welcome distraction while it lasted. This Space could be a one-off created by a hilarious user, or it could be a sign that Clubhouse’s roleplay culture may be bleeding over into Twitter. Even if that sign is shaped like McDonald’s iconic golden arches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE4bW86HfAYrTlwzmeUDjm5YN-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277130/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s wire-free webcam could one day eradicate Zoom side-eye</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkjLDM1-Fy6cCrik6LkETgQMsAA=/105x0:1239x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277115/dell_pari_wireless_webcam.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqGYDy"&gt;Dell’s vision for the future of webcams, the &lt;a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/blog/dell-s-latest-concepts-for-seamless-work-experiences/"&gt;Concept Pari&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t the kind that stays glued to the same spot on top of your monitor — &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dell-thinks-a-mini-wireless-webcam-and-pc-companion-wil-1848216351"&gt;it’s one that offers a lot more mobility&lt;/a&gt;. Ahead of CES, the company showed off the webcam alongside its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22832895/dell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment"&gt;ultra-repairable Luna laptop concept&lt;/a&gt;. The Concept Pari doesn’t just cut the wire — it adds magnets that would theoretically make it easier to place anywhere on your screen, which means instead of automatically giving people side-eye on Zoom calls, you could finally make some eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIRtwZ"&gt;At first glance, the Concept Pari looks like the typical webcam that sits atop your monitor. However, Dell made it so that you can remove the cylindrical camera housing from its dock (which also doubles as a USB-C wireless charging station, letting you carry around the 1oz camera in your hand). The camera itself shoots in 1080p, has a built-in mic, and because it’s wireless, is connected to Wi-Fi. Dell also notes that it comes with a vertical indicator light, helping you maintain alignment as you use the camera freehandedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c9kSIj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Concept Pari comes with a magnetic backing that allows you to stick the camera anywhere on your monitor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YW0CT8"&gt;What might be neater than its wire-free housing is that if you’re tired of staring into the face of a soulless webcam during virtual meetings, the Concept Pari comes with a magnetic backing that allows you to stick the camera anywhere on your monitor (hopefully without affecting the display). Place the camera just above the head of the person you’re talking with, and you should be able to comfortably maintain eye contact while actually looking at the person on your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sIBhC"&gt;When you’re done with a meeting, you can reverse the camera in its dock so that it’s facing away from you, offering additional privacy when the camera’s not in use. Dell says it will still charge when it’s in this position. Although the webcam isn’t for sale just yet, and very well may never be, it’s a concept that doesn’t seem too unrealistic to see a lot of people adopting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ciz6bcwL_cK1fzwT8TrVY-JUHag=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277069/VRG_ILLO_4925_K_Radtke_Amazon_Disaster.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Six people died in an Amazon warehouse collapse — why were they there at all?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2ToQoz"&gt;The tragic collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois during last week’s historic tornado outbreak in the Midwest is raising questions about the safety of the e-commerce giant’s packing facilities and the policies and protocols Amazon has in place to protect workers during disasters. Despite hours of notice that severe weather was imminent, workers were not sent home before a tornado struck the warehouse and killed six people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qek76q"&gt;The tornado appeared relatively suddenly, but it shouldn’t have caught warehouse managers off-guard. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1469488781594034177?s=20"&gt;The official tornado warning&lt;/a&gt; from the National Weather Service came &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/lsx/12_10_2021"&gt;just 22 minutes&lt;/a&gt; before the tornado itself — but those rushed timelines are typical for tornadoes. More importantly, the National Weather Service warned of a moderate risk of tornadoes the day before the disaster, so anyone running a facility should have known to be on their guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yFRfN"&gt;But crucially, there was no legal obligation for how the Edwardsville warehouse needed to respond to the warnings. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires most businesses to have Emergency Action Plans, which include evacuation procedures, but US law leaves it up to employers to make the call on whether to send employees home ahead of a natural disaster. A spokesperson for OSHA wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they were “not aware of any policy or requirement of a business to shut down and send people home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="klvy0h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s the private sector. They can do what they want to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zyah1Q"&gt;Experts in the emergency management field believe it’s unlikely such a policy will ever be implemented at the national scale because of its unpopularity with businesses and how it might cut into profits. Plus, every business is different — and there might be some with more critical operations or with components that could become dangerous if left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFlIng"&gt;“​​They’re never going to make a law or a policy to do that, because it’s the private sector. They can do what they want to do,” says Laura Myers, senior research scientist and director of the University of Alabama’s Center for Advanced Public Safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMYgJF"&gt;In short, it was Amazon’s choice about whether the tornado risk was severe enough to shut down the factory — and the company chose to keep the warehouse running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbfYgo"&gt;“The event itself has opened the eyes of many to the fact that we’ve probably had this patchwork quilt for a long time, and maybe it’s time to put those pieces together,” says Kimberly Klockow-McClain, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrxYXk"&gt;Amazon did not answer questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about why it decided to keep its warehouses open despite the severe weather. OSHA is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833012/amazon-fatal-warehouse-collapse-osha-investigation-illinois-tornado"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; what took place the night that the tornado tore through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaE6nS"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon PR manager Alisa Carroll said that “emergency response training is provided to new employees and that training is reinforced throughout the year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YK6xKq"&gt;She further added that the company updated its cellphone policy in 2020 due to COVID, “allowing our employees to have their phones with them. All reporting that it’s been rolled back to pre-COVID is simply not true and factually incorrect.” Phones are critical for receiving alerts about severe weather and can be especially vital to workers if their employers aren’t taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoUj0Y"&gt;Carroll added that “OSHA guidance clearly states to take shelter immediately when there’s a tornado warning. Our leaders on the ground followed their training and did just that, moving quickly to get people to take shelter immediately. That likely saved many lives from this storm.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recovery operations continue after the partial collapse of an Amazon facility in Edwardsville, Illinois on December 12th, 2021. The facility was damaged by a tornado on December 10th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg0HuU"&gt;Still, the tragedy fits a troubling pattern of Amazon warehouse workers staying at their posts through extreme and even dangerous conditions. In June, during a record heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, some &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/heat-wave-daily-news-updates-june-27-what-to-know-about-the-heat-dome-across-the-pacific-northwest/"&gt;workers at an Amazon warehouse in Washington state&lt;/a&gt; said many workstations lacked functioning fans, and temperatures inside the facility were close to 90 degrees. At Amazon’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse"&gt;workers reported in July&lt;/a&gt; that the warehouse was too hot, while they were pushed to keep “working at a non-stop pace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZduiXu"&gt;Workers at the Edwardsville warehouse &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/12/13/amazon-illinois-tornado-safety-protocols/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they received almost no emergency training and were discouraged from taking time off during natural disasters — something that appears to be common across the company’s warehouses. Courtenay Brown, a worker at an Amazon Fresh warehouse in Avenel, New Jersey, told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that workers there also received little training about what to do in an emergency. “They teach you how to do the job, show you what to do, then you go on your own, and that’s it,” Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wbdinz"&gt;Brown recalled one incident when there was a chemical leak at the facility. “Only the front of the warehouse was evacuated, until the fire department found out ‘Oh wait, there are hundreds of people in the back of the warehouse?’” she said. The employees in the back didn’t know there was an emergency at first, Brown said, and when they realized what was happening no one was quite sure where to go. “We just started screaming at everyone to exit out the dock doors, we tried to get every single person out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmilF4"&gt;There are also structural factors that can place warehouses at greater risk. Warehouses are often built using “tilt-up construction,” says Matt May, director of the emergency management department for the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas. Concrete slabs are tilted to become walls and then held upright by their connections to the roof. It’s a practice that &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627135242/http://www.kansascity.com/2011/06/25/2975177/experts-challenge-building-design.html#ixzz1QZoEgC5d"&gt;engineers criticized&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a 2011 tornado that decimated a Home Depot in Joplin, Missouri. That could be a bigger issue for worker safety in the US moving forward, since warehouses have replaced offices as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816131/warehouses-natural-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;most common commercial buildings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTgpRw"&gt;Historically, building codes haven’t addressed the severe winds associated with tornadoes, according to Anne Cope, chief engineer at the nonprofit research organization Insurance Institute for Business &amp;amp; Home Safety. But OSHA’s guidance on tornadoes says to avoid “auditoriums, cafeterias and gymnasiums that have flat, wide-span roofs” — structures similar in shape to warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nmrW07"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What is its highest priority?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0zl7ob"&gt;“The biggest challenge for [Amazon] is their buildings themselves,” May says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pCsU3"&gt;The tragedy is already galvanizing labor groups, which see it as part of a broader problem with the company. Eric Frumin is the health and safety director for the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), a coalition of four labor unions that has pushed for actions against Amazon, and says the Edwardsville deaths can be traced to Amazon’s practice of placing customers ahead of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2pjJyN"&gt;“What is its highest priority? They have not been shy about this: the company says it is obsessed with pleasing customers,” he said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And everything else, including worker safety, be damned.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiOChQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s west coast server outage is over, and Twitch is back up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EQ1VIP9rWgSwY7OP9kuViZqvUgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276721/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aG5j0H"&gt;Amazon Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829544/amazon-web-services-overwhelmed-network-outage"&gt;barely finished the postmortem&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;last week’s incident that interrupted deliveries and shut off feeds from security cameras&lt;/a&gt; before AWS started having problems again. While last week’s outage was in the US-EAST-1 region, reports around 10:45AM showed connections to the company’s US-West servers were failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1iLTt5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team is aware and hard at work fixing them - we'll continue to update you, here.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1471144138473189382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YoC5qt"&gt;The network of Amazon server farms powers more services than you can imagine, but the most visible sign of trouble showed up once Twitch, the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform, went down. A tweet from its support account said, “We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5axcdt"&gt;There are also reports of disconnections for services like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, DoorDash, Duo, and Slack, while gamers experienced disconnections and server issues across Nintendo Online, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBjGTS"&gt;A message on the &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS Status page&lt;/a&gt; initially said, “We are investigating Internet connectivity issues” for both the US-WEST-1 and US-WEST-2 region. Now, Amazon reports that “[we] have resolved the issue affecting Internet connectivity” as of 11:10AM ET, and hopefully, it will stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JmIDg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 11:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note the outage has been resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sifu’s stunning martial arts combat will appeal to a generation of kung fu fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pjB26wW4skpkApc01u-z58lH2zo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276813/SIFU_Reveal_Screenshot_1920x1080_CorridorAfter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQ3gfE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;, the newest game from &lt;em&gt;Absolver&lt;/em&gt; developer Sloclap, feels like exactly the kind of shot in the arm the roguelike genre needs. Far too many of that style of game favors sword and board combat in medieval or otherwise indeterminate but distant past fantasy settings. &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshingly modern take on the die-and-restart style of play that ditches the sword in favor of these hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic8Bv8"&gt;I got to play a bit of &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; in a hands-on preview that demos the first half of the second chapter. The preview dropped me right into the action — no tutorial mission, no story explanation, just a destination simply known as The Club. The preview makes you fight your way through the club, battling simple minions that go down in one or two punches to heavy hitters that require more skill and planning to take down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8L2po"&gt;I immediately fell in love with &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s aesthetic. It’s just a touch more colorful than realistic games but not fully neon-splattered. Combat presents an interesting dichotomy in that it’s simple to execute by stringing together combos of button presses, but hard to master such that you’ll get your ass beat quickly and often if you rely on button mashing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJ9LvF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10925391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCwwwD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; cleverly iterates on traditional roguelike elements, which adds to its refreshing appeal. Death doesn’t immediately reset your progress, instead you have a death counter that increases along with your age. Immediately after you fall, you can spend XP earned from successful fights to add and upgrade your abilities. Then you get back up again, right where you fell. Each death adds to your age starting at age 20. When you die at age 21, since it is your second death, you age up to 23. Your third death, you reawaken at 26 and so on. Every time you die and age, your health decreases but your damage increases. You’re &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt;, but you’re also &lt;em&gt;wiser&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8makF"&gt;You are not allowed to age infinitely, you have a magical pendant with five charges that expire at set intervals that decrease the older you get. Once you reach 77 years old or around the eighth or ninth death, your cycle of reincarnation ends and you’re forced to start the level over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vx8sfJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every time you die and age, your health decreases but your damage increases. You’re &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt;, but you’re also &lt;em&gt;wiser&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkdQjg"&gt;I really dig the aging factor for another reason: the main character is smokin’ hot. He could get it at any age, but I find he’s at his zaddiest from age 34 and up when his beard and hair are the most luscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ83MR"&gt;Absent any significant story beats outside of a pressing but vague need to find a man named Sean, it’s hard to say how well &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s story is developed. &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; trades on powerful, culturally significant imagery of Chinese people and their martial arts tradition. Without careful consideration coupled with the involvement of Chinese people versed in these traditions during every stage of the development process, it’d be painfully easy for &lt;em&gt;Sifu &lt;/em&gt;to fall into offensive or at least culturally insensitive stereotypes. I hope &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s development didn’t fail to clear that minimum requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7cI9F"&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s fluid, authentic-looking combat I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;can see why the game has been highly anticipated since its announcement: kung fu combat like this just doesn’t exist in video games right now. Plus, with a generation of gamers growing up on Chow Yun-fat, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li movies, the streets were aching for a proper kung fu / martial arts combat game. From what I’ve seen, &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; fills that long overdue need. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cross some names off your list without spending a mint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CQfDlO"&gt;It should go without saying, but the best gifts aren’t always the most expensive. There are plenty of affordable pieces of tech and non-tech items that would make for great gifts or stocking stuffers, many of which should still arrive in time for the holidays despite fast-approaching shipping deadlines. If you’re in need of ideas, we recently polled &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to curate a budget-based wishlist that spans our favorite tools, gadgets, and other goodies that can typically be had for around $25 or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxYmk"&gt;The responses we got ranged from practical to personal, from helpful to hilarious. Whether you’re in the market for a vest to keep your beverage from getting chilly, a sadistic puzzle that will take any Rubik’s Cube fan down a peg, or chopsticks from a galaxy far, far away, our budget-friendly gift guide is a manifestation of everything that you want, but nothing you need. Even if you’re shopping for yourself instead of someone special, we know that our suggestions will help make your life a little easier or, at the very least, coax out a smile. After all, pens that say what we’re all thinking tend to have that effect on people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlnxQa"&gt;Check out:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

The G604 features a powerful 25K DPI optical sensor and 15 programmable buttons. Perhaps the most striking feature of this claw-shaped mouse is the cluster of six buttons above the thumb rest that is ideal for storing macros. This mouse may lack the trademark RGB lighting present with most gaming mice, but this lends the G604 an impressive battery life, reportedly capable of lasting up to 240 hours with a single AA battery.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IEhYj2"&gt;One of the more impressive ambidextrous mice available from Logitech, the G903 Hero, features a 25K DPI sensor and has buttons that can be added or removed depending on if you’re a righty or lefty. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Regularly $149.99, this mouse has been discounted to $89.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This wireless mouse features a total of 11 programmable buttons and can last up to 140 hours on a single charge, but it is also compatible with Logitech’s Powerplay charging system, which allows the mouse to constantly charge, even while in use.

Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this headset ($129.99), but this is still a solid value for this versatile headset. The BlackShark V2 Pro is lightweight, features a detachable boom mic, and has a dedicated volume knob on the left earcup. The headset can last up to 24 hours on a single charge and still features a 3.5mm audio jack. If you like the aesthetics but aren’t ready to shell out $100 for a headset, you can also check out the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B086PKMZ1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard BlackShark V2&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a wired connection, but has been discounted by $25, bringing the regular price down to just $74.99.&lt;/p&gt;

NZXT has remained a staple in the PC building community thanks to its focus on simple and functional design aesthetics. NZXT is also offering this discount with its BLD kits that allow you to build your own PC while minimizing the frustrations that often plague these projects. Each BLD Kit includes everything you’ll need to build your own machine, including tools and an illustrated guidebook with step-by-step video walkthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce8ihz"&gt;The main attraction of this sale is NZXT’s pre-built and custom-built systems, and if you’re still trying to snag a 30-series Nvidia GPU or AMD 6000-series at MSRP, this is one of the best ways to do it. While the BLD service is one of the easiest ways to get a gaming PC with guaranteed performance, you’re always welcome to pick out your own components and have the capable team at NZXT handle the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
