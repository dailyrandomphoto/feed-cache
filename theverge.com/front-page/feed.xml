    <title>Amazon offers up more data to tell third-party sellers which items will be popular</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="HaR7MP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/today-amazon-accelerate-amazon-announces-product-opportunity"&gt;Amazon has announced a tool&lt;/a&gt; that will give sellers access to information about what shoppers are currently looking for and help make it easier to choose which products to create next. Amazon calls it the Product Opportunity Explorer and says that it’ll give sellers access to data and trends that will help them “identify opportunities to launch new, high-potential products to serve unmet customer demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlP6va"&gt;With Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/19/20874818/amazon-allbirds-shoe-clone-copy-sneaker-206-collective-private-label"&gt;track record&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;copying popular products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;selling them under its Amazon Basics brand&lt;/a&gt;, an obvious concern with this tool is where the data is coming from and how granular it is. While Amazon quotes a seller saying that they’re excited to get “recommendations specifically relevant” to their business, it’s easy to imagine other sellers being nervous that Amazon’s suggestions could direct businesses to rip off existing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SvmM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon Basics’ history could make some sellers nervous about the company providing product development recommendations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7K29"&gt;However, an Amazon spokesperson speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; claims that the tool will be giving sellers aggregated data that won’t give out specifics about how other brands are doing. Instead, the company says that the tool will give suggestions for products that perhaps customers are searching for, but not finding. For example, if a company sells bikes on Amazon, and there’s demand for a blue bike for preteen girls, the tool may recommend that they try to sell that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw7bwK"&gt;The tool will also give broader category and subcategory metrics, such as what people are searching for, pricing trends, and the like. In its press release, Amazon says that the tool gives sellers “rich insights into what customers are searching for, clicking on, and buying, as well as not buying,” along with “detailed data on search volume and growth, sales history, and pricing trends.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvqzVl"&gt;For its part, Amazon has denied in the past that it abuses its dual role as a product developer and marketplace provider. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;The EU has accused Amazon&lt;/a&gt; of “systematically” using data from its marketplace that others can’t get. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724152/amazon-india-search-result-rigging-reference-product-seller-data-report"&gt;recent report about Amazon India&lt;/a&gt; alleges even more egregious behavior there. The EU commission hasn’t released a report or findings stemming from the accusations, and Amazon has pushed back against both accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4TzeC1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Basics ripped off accessories, now Amazon is coming for gadgets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QP962K"&gt;There are also other minor concerns — if everyone has access to the same data or gets similar recommendations, could it start more algorithm-directed arms races between sellers to be the first to try to fill a perceived niche? And could Amazon risk damage to its relationship with sellers if the data predicts a product will do well, but it ends up totally flopping? The company may have the opportunity to figure those questions out before they become real problems, though; it will test the Product Opportunity Explorer in beta before releasing it for free to all sellers in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1P6ZN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 5:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information from Amazon about what kind of metrics and recommendations the tool will provide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard discrimination case shouldn’t halt over agency feud, California argues in new court filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout in the response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4A1GTygyPv66Px2UXZwhc4YsvNM=/0x181:4200x2981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022943/1234303832.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AxpRf6"&gt;After Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735273/activision-blizzard-requests-stay-in-harassment-lawsuit-alleging-conflict-of-interest"&gt;requested a stay&lt;/a&gt; in the discrimination case brought against it by the state of California, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has filed its response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPdqqU"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s request for a stay asserts that lawyers with the DFEH engaged in misconduct arising from a conflict of interest. According to the filing, some of the lawyers working on the case had previously worked on a separate case against the company when they were employed by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC). Such an arrangement, Activision Blizzard argues, is in violation of a California state bar conflict of interest rule. As a result, the discrimination case should be put on hold until the conflict is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXaBYs"&gt;Today in the superior court of California, the DFEH filed its response: “Activision hopes to conjure a scandal from these mundane facts, based on an aggressive misreading of California Rules of Professional Conduct.” Both the objection and DFEH’s response are only arguments, and have no legal force without a ruling from the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miRr9v"&gt;The DFEH argues that the two lawyers in question had little involvement in the EEOC’s investigation of Activision Blizzard during their time there. Even if there were a conflict, the filing continues, the lawyers in question have already been taken off the case and the DFEH is being represented in this case by an outside law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8m2HsX"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s objection arises from a conflict between the two employment agencies that have filed suit against the company. Earlier this month, EEOC brought the alleged conflict of interest to light after the DFEH tried to intervene in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;$18 million dollar settlement&lt;/a&gt; between the EEOC and Activision Blizzard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gp5s0"&gt;The DFEH argues that the settlement is premature and that the EEOC did not investigate the matter properly before providing Activision Blizzard with the option to settle. Furthermore, the DFEH claims interference was necessary because the settlement between Activision Blizzard and the EEOC which, again, is a federal agency, could protect it from litigation already filed on behalf of the state — in this case the DFEH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ANtHh"&gt;The EEOC told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has no comment beyond its filings and the DFEH says it cannot comment on an open case. In a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/20/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-dfeh-eeoc-feud/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a former Blizzard employee says the matter “feels incredibly bad all over.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at Microsoft’s new Windows 11 Android apps support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDYaBVrY8eI4X3UkT2TULmacBBA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022861/thumbnail_v3_notext.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCMpny"&gt;Microsoft has released the first preview version of its Android apps support in Windows 11. It’s available to testers in the Beta Channel version of Windows 11, which means you’ll need to opt into the Windows Insider program to get access. I’ve installed the preview version on two systems — a gaming rig with a Core i9 11900K and Microsoft’s Surface Pro X — to get a feel for exactly how well Android apps run on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpVgkK"&gt;The experience of installing apps is very simple. Microsoft has partnered with Amazon, so the Microsoft Store will list apps but send you over to Amazon’s Appstore app to get them installed or updated. This also installs a Windows Subsystem for Android in the background, which is the core technology that powers Android apps running on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnSdFLSghwYftFmrK7dQtqQSJ8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943047/android1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Subsystem for Android powers the entire experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIGD8V"&gt;Apps effectively run in a virtual machine, contained within their own world but able to sit side by side with other Windows apps. You can pin Android apps to the Start menu or taskbar and use all of the windowing and multitasking features of Windows 11 just like a regular desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEs2Xe"&gt;While there are only 50 apps officially available in this preview, I was able to install Amazon’s Kindle app, the BBC Sounds app, and a bunch of games to test just how well Windows 11 handles mobile games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx7caR"&gt;On both the Surface Pro X (an Arm-powered device) and my Intel-powered gaming rig, apps ran surprisingly well. I was able to run them alongside Word, Chrome, and other desktop apps, as if they were just regular Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbWLR7fj_eqqOsux2bAfSx2G4Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943049/android2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps and games running side by side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sFifJo"&gt;Apps show up in search results as if they were regular Windows ones, and the integration into the Start menu and taskbar makes them feel just like any other app. It’s surprisingly seamless and a well-integrated solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U1C91"&gt;The preview isn’t perfect, though. I noticed 100 percent CPU utilization when I attempted to get four Android games running side by side using Windows 11’s Snap Layouts feature on my gaming PC. Everything suddenly felt laggy, until seconds later it sprung back to life and the CPU usage went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svltAK"&gt;Likewise, games didn’t seem to run very well on the Surface Pro X with low frame rates and stuttering. This is a preview though, so I’d hope to see performance improve before this ships to all Windows 11 users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9UPf1gxea08VpKcyO8tPHYvXXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943053/android3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Appstore is the only official way to get Android apps on Windows 11 outside of sideloading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yh3jE2"&gt;I also noticed in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV &lt;/em&gt;that the game reloads when you attempt to resize it, and some apps and games don’t resize particularly well. It all depends on how developers have built their apps, but expect most to run best in phone-like dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIZN1t"&gt;The question is whether you actually want or need Android apps. I personally only need a handful, like the Kindle app or some smart home apps, but it’s the Android mobile games that are more interesting to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTA2qM"&gt;Bluestacks has supported Android apps on Windows for years, and the company has leaned heavily into supporting mobile games on Windows. Microsoft is late to the party here, but its subsystem is clearly the result of years of work to extend Windows to running Linux kernels and GUI apps. While Microsoft is busy getting Android apps on Windows 11 working, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701930/bluestacks-x-android-games-browser-free-cloud-gaming"&gt;Bluestacks is now in the process&lt;/a&gt; of bringing Android apps into the browser and running them in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4x55XyCSsi19IgJ4Zzg5mgzI-xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943060/android4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps can run alongside Windows apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dfiRLG"&gt;Microsoft’s Android apps support relies on the Amazon Appstore for now, which has only a fraction of the apps available on Google’s Play Store. It’s inevitable that someone will sideload this onto Windows 11 and unlock many more apps with it, but Microsoft won’t officially be supporting this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vfdMy"&gt;Still, the initial preview is a lot more complete and smooth (on the right hardware) than I expected. Microsoft’s initial release to the Beta Channel of Windows Insider also suggests this might appear for everyone using Windows 11 a lot sooner than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV’s news app expands free local coverage to a lot more places</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kKR8ISWZ6F_cZmHPwEzZYGyX_fQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022763/1_MswigxHbznGaVa0XDbIiZw.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G1vP8"&gt;Amazon announced today that it’s doubling the number of local stations it supports through its news app on Fire TV, meaning more users will be able to easily find local news coverage for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmvS0I"&gt;The company said in a &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that this week’s coverage expansion will make local news available in 158 total US cities. That’s up from coverage in 88 cities following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337922/amazon-fire-tv-free-local-news-streaming-app"&gt;previous expansion&lt;/a&gt; in March. As of today, the number of local stations available through the news app has hiked from 126 to 259. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmgXi5"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson clarified that some metro areas offer more than one local station in the Amazon news app on Fire TV. The company said that more than 50 metro areas now offer more than one local news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08a7LZ"&gt;The news app is free and supported on all Fire TV devices, the company said. No extra steps need to be taken to get regional access in your area. Amazon says users can simply navigate to the local news tab from within the news app, and the player will add the station or stations for the closest supported city and automatically dial it in. (Asking Alexa to “play local news” will also launch the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFuOFU"&gt;Amazon has pretty quickly expanded its free and local news coverage since &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazons-news-app-now-supports-local-news-7b96b7978fee"&gt;launching support&lt;/a&gt; in 12 cities last year. Like many free live TV services from streamers including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;The Roku Channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577727/plex-15-new-tv-channels"&gt;Plex TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552590/viacomcbs-streaming-paramount-plus-earnings-q3-license-pluto-tv-competition"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s free and customizable news app is ad-supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBb2pY"&gt;As of this week, local news coverage will now be supported in Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Memphis, Miami, New Orleans, and dozens of other cities. The full list of new metro areas that can now watch local news through Fire TV’s news app can be found &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar is backing the Facebook whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocL0Gm"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;testified in front of Congress two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; about the ways the company’s products can bring harm to users after leaking documents supporting her claims to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the SEC. Now &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/20/tech-billionaire-aiding-facebook-whistleblower-516358"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the campaign to support Haugen’s advocacy has been aided by eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar, as she takes on the place where she previously worked as a product manager assigned to the Civic Integrity group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ad8vAk"&gt;Omidyar is no stranger to the media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/19/5227900/pierre-omidyars-news-project-gets-a-name-and-a-business-model"&gt;providing financial backing to&lt;em&gt; The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and the open internet advocacy group &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, when asked to comment, his advocacy group Omidyar Network &lt;a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c"&gt;pointed to an unbylined blog post&lt;/a&gt; that went up today titled “In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to Account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HUA59"&gt;If you’re looking for a “why” behind the impactful rollout of Haugen’s testimony and the Facebook Files reported by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c"&gt;the blog post&lt;/a&gt; lays out clear intentions for the machine behind everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWTJTR"&gt;“With little competition, regulation, or other countervailing checks and balances, Big Tech has too much influence. Until recently, these platforms largely avoided meaningful public oversight, which has allowed them to do as they wish, often at the expense of consumers, start-ups, and their employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em9htF"&gt;“Even as Big Tech’s reach has extended further and faster, it has remained largely opaque. We have had a nagging feeling that the harms they cause are known to them — and are far worse than the public could imagine. That has been validated as truth by a series of courageous whistleblowers who have spoken out and delivered evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p50VT4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"},{"title":"The whistleblower hearing hits Facebook where the company is weakest ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EbP1se"&gt;The level of polish and coordination accompanying the rollout of the files has been evident, inviting open speculation about who is making Facebook’s nightmare month possible. Omidyar’s participation isn’t exactly a surprise — the Network &lt;a href="https://omidyar.com/news/roadmap-for-an-antitrust-case-against-facebook/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a 39-page PDF last year titled “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq3b6e"&gt;It’s unlikely that Omidyar and associated organizations are the only ones in play here either, as &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; notes that Haugen’s schedule puts her, and her files, in front of a UK Parliament committee next week. Appearances in France and Belgium will follow next month, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;an appointment with Facebook’s Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have a date yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vI8mIW"&gt;That’s not even including an impending release of articles by multiple media outlets that Facebook communications VP John Pinette &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154006727200771"&gt;referred to as a “gotcha campaign”&lt;/a&gt; without describing what his company has been caught doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSdMn1"&gt;Haugen’s method — and her proposed solutions for the problems she identifies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;can fall into more than one category&lt;/a&gt;. Still, a carefully executed media rollout has, so far, kept her claims from being ignored or forgotten. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737081/facebook-instagram-mark-zuckerberg-testify-senate-child-safety-frances-haugen"&gt;sent out a request for Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook execs to testify&lt;/a&gt; in response to the information revealed in the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qiMSw4"&gt;

    <title>Tesla bucks chip shortage woes with another profitable quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model X redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V259KuKqYZ2nsCvV02nNbB7F7fk=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022625/MX_Exterior_Hero_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUDDl2"&gt;Tesla’s record third quarter brought its biggest three-month windfall ever, as the company &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it turned a $1.6 billion profit. That’s despite a global semiconductor shortage and delays in the rollout of the refreshed Model S sedan and Model X SUV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zXTeK"&gt;Tesla turned that profit on just over $13.7 billion in revenue, and did it while its average sales price continued to drop due to the increasing popularity of the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. Tesla has also continued to increase the profitability of those vehicles — the company said Wednesday that the gross margin on its cars is up to nearly 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tbm6Py"&gt;Tesla’s success in the quarter stands in stark relief from the trouble other automakers have faced thanks to the chip shortage and larger global supply chain crunches. General Motors’ sales in the US dropped 33 percent compared to the same period last year, while Ford’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/fords-sales-improving-but-still-down-by-27point4percent-in-the-third-quarter.html"&gt;dropped about 27 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla, meanwhile, increased its global deliveries to more than 241,000 in the quarter, continuing the automaker’s steady growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1SRk47"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-1zGhU" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/1zGhU/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="700" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(billions in USD; green indicates profitable quarter)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1zGhU/1/" data-iframe-width="700" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla's quarterly revenue and profit/loss" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-1zGhU");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-1zGhU");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LlJaq"&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;sourcing different chips and rewriting software on the fly&lt;/a&gt; to make them work, Tesla was able to avoid the same kinds of major headaches caused by the shortage. But its success in 2021 is also thanks to increased popularity of the Model Y SUV — which it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/"&gt;just started selling in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the UK — as well as a growing global presence. The company’s factory in China has been pumping out vehicles for more than a year now, and it has two more scheduled to come online in the near future in Texas and Germany. In fact, Tesla said Wednesday that it is already making some pre-production vehicles at the Austin, Texas factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOtNIt"&gt;“A variety of challenges, including semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts, have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed. We believe our supply chain, engineering and production teams have been dealing with these global challenges with ingenuity, agility and flexibility that is unparalleled in the automotive industry,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVOhlh"&gt;It wasn’t just a financially good quarter for Tesla, it was also a very busy one. In August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system and its tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;crash into parked emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and two senators followed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;by asking the FTC to also investigate&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653205/tesla-roadster-elon-musk-ship-delay-2023"&gt;next-gen Roadster&lt;/a&gt; were both delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs6GP1"&gt;Tesla also held an “AI Day” event where CEO Elon Musk detailed its artificial intelligence efforts and announced the company is starting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633514/tesla-robot-prototype-elon-musk-humanoid-ai-day"&gt;work on humanoid robots&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla said Wednesday that AI Day served its purpose as a recruiting event because it sparked an “overwhelming number of applications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y62Gak"&gt;In September, the new head of the National Transportation Safety Board said she wanted Tesla to address “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;basic safety issues&lt;/a&gt;” with its “Full Self-Driving” beta software before releasing it to more owners. Tesla went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;released it anyway&lt;/a&gt; — though it created a so-called “Safety Score” evaluation process that only allows drivers who drive a certain way to access the beta software. Tesla made owners sign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged them from sharing footage of the software performing poorly. But then Musk, speaking at Recode’s annual Code Conference, said owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699361/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-nda-footage"&gt;weren’t following those instructions and backed off the practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeWtHw"&gt;And just after the quarter ended, Musk announced that he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;moving Tesla’s headquarters to Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvnzz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR treatment for lazy eye in children gets FDA approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0z8ne3j2RHHxl3f9ANvf7tScfQ=/0x223:1348x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022560/easy_to_use.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Luminopia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QD26bT"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved a virtual reality-based treatment for children with the visual disorder amblyopia, or lazy eye, the company behind the therapy announced today. Patients watch modified TV shows or movies through a virtual reality headset to improve their vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8ysu8"&gt;“We’re proud to be part of the FDA’s groundbreaking decision today, to approve a first-of-its-kind digital therapeutic that allows patients to watch their favorite TV shows and movies to improve their vision,” Scott Xiao, chief executive officer of Luminopia, the company that developed the tool, said &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020005896/en/Luminopia-Announces-FDA-Approval-of-Digital-Therapeutic-that-Uses-TV-Shows-to-Improve-Vision-in-Children-with-Lazy-Eye"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16kYlq"&gt;Around 3 percent of children have amblyopia, which develops when the brain and eyes stop communicating properly. The brain favors one eye, which leads to vision problems in the other eye. It’s the leading cause of vision problems in children. It’s usually treated by blocking the stronger eye with a patch or blurring drops, forcing the brain to rely on the weaker&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpyFzx"&gt;Luminopia’s approach uses TV and movies to develop the weaker eye and train the eyes to work together. Patients watch the show or movie through a headset that shows the images to each eye separately. The images shown to the stronger eye have a lower contrast, and the images are presented with overlays that force the brain to use both eyes to see them properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N70MNtwRL4nYdx5jkXdKFWBCv9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942830/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_3.29.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the video modifications used in the treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HycKjd"&gt;Kids using the therapy and wearing glasses had more improvement in their vision than a similar group of kids who did not use the therapy and just wore corrective glasses full time during a &lt;a href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420%2821%2900682-5/fulltext#appsec1"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of the technology. After 12 weeks watching the shows one hour per day, six days per week, 62 percent of kids using the treatment had a strong improvement in their vision. Only around a third of the kids in the comparison group had similar improvements over the course of the 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkSluz"&gt;Luminopia has over 700 hours of programming in its library, and it partnered with kids’ content distributors like Nelvana and Sesame Workshop to develop the tool. The authors of the clinical trial wrote that they think that the option to pick popular videos might be one reason users stuck to the program — people followed the treatment plan 88 percent of the time. Less than 50 percent of patients stick to eye patches or blurring drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bivka5"&gt;With the approval, Luminopia joins &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/digital-therapeutics-for-substance-use-disorders-from-research-to-practice"&gt;only a handful&lt;/a&gt; of companies with clearance to offer a digital therapeutic as a prescription treatment for medical conditions. Last year, the FDA approved a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;prescription video game&lt;/a&gt; called EndeavorRx, which treats ADHD in kids between eight and 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbzODw"&gt;Luminopia said in a statement that it plans to launch the treatment in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyper’s new 245W USB-C battery pack and charger are here to help charge all your gear at once</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TUdkT0CeMYrGnZ2TNVUnVtNhBg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022497/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3NMuz"&gt;Hyper has announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fhyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack-gan-charger%3Futm_source%3DCE%2520Week%25202019%2520Media%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3DIGG%2520245W%2520Press%2520Release%252010%252F20%252F21%2520%2528V5pTV6%2529%26_kx%3DOg8u1GQv7e7xvHJH0NQIEKiacDIMFRlM5SvWAf5Y_eTH8PB4Oyp4MB7tofUr_EYB.KdRC4D%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22736571%2Fhyper-hyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack-charger-indiegogo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair of over-the-top USB-C accessories&lt;/a&gt;: HyperJuice 245W USB-C Battery Pack and the HyperJuice 245W USB-C GaN Charger, each of which offers four USB-C ports for charging up all your gadgets at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrEn4X"&gt;Despite the big “245W” in the names here, neither the new charger nor the new battery pack uses the recently released USB-C PD 3.1 spec that enables charging at up to 240W. Rather, the number refers to the total combined wattage that the new products can put out across the four total ports; each port still maxes out at 100W, though. (Which means that you won’t be able to use it for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734233/apple-140w-macbook-charging-brick-gan-usb-c-pd-3-1-third-party-chargers"&gt;140W fast charging&lt;/a&gt; on a new 16-inch MacBook Pro, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6srHZD-f53R-5CGdD8RcJip69I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942909/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_3.49.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="suC7g3"&gt;The HyperJuice 245W USB-C GaN Charger features four ports, each rated for 100W, although due to the vagaries of USB-C specs, the charging breaks down as follows: one device at up to 100W; two devices at up to 100W each; three devices with two at up to 100W and one at up to 45W; or four devices with one at 100W and three at 45W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkI1GE"&gt;Similarly, the battery pack also has various limitations; consult the following chart here for the breakdown of the various power distribution options. The battery pack itself is a 27,000mAh (100Wh) battery, meaning that it &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; fits under the maximum limit for bringing on planes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqF7FqvHAx_XUBlK-1nxLA-WH_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942766/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_3.04.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6RZ0li"&gt;The two products aren’t the first high-wattage USB-C chargers or battery packs we’ve seen; Zendure released similar products last year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21409482/zendure-supertank-pro-charger-review"&gt;its SuperTank Pro battery pack&lt;/a&gt; that’s so similar to the new HyperJuice that they appear to have identical displays and iconography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFgaL0"&gt;The new HyperJuice charger and battery pack &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fhyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack-gan-charger%3Futm_source%3DCE%2520Week%25202019%2520Media%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3DIGG%2520245W%2520Press%2520Release%252010%252F20%252F21%2520%2528V5pTV6%2529%26_kx%3DOg8u1GQv7e7xvHJH0NQIEKiacDIMFRlM5SvWAf5Y_eTH8PB4Oyp4MB7tofUr_EYB.KdRC4D%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22736571%2Fhyper-hyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack-charger-indiegogo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available to back on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;, with shipping planned for December. The charger starts at $99 with early bird pricing, with an expected retail price of $199, while the battery pack starts at $149 with an expected retail price of $299.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reaches settlement after being accused of discriminating against US workers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uyvsuc"&gt;Facebook settled with the US Department of Justice following claims that it discriminated against US workers (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/facebook-settles-claims-it-discriminated-against-us-workers-for-jobs.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150949/facebook-visa-law-justice-department-charged-guest-worker"&gt;The DOJ filed charges against Facebook in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that Facebook reserved specific positions for temporary visa holders and discouraged US citizens from applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfvj66"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-labor-departments-reach-settlements-facebook-resolving-claims-discrimination-against"&gt;A report from the DOJ&lt;/a&gt; revealed that it’s fining Facebook $4.75 million in civil penalties and is requiring Facebook to pay up to $9.5 million to any victims of Facebook’s alleged discriminatory practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff2YBu"&gt;Facebook also reached a separate agreement with the US Department of Labor. During an audit of Facebook’s PERM applications — the program that lets visa holders permanently work in the US — the DOL found potential recruitment violations that it’s going to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j14UW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Companies cannot set aside certain positions for temporary visa holders because of their citizenship or immigration status.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkca9E"&gt;In addition to paying two fines, Facebook will also have to train employees on the anti-discrimination policies of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as widely advertise its PERM positions. It’ll also have to start accepting resumes and applications electronically. It was previously urging applicants to apply by mail for visa-eligible positions. Accepting applications by mail and failing to make visa-eligible positions more visible were just a couple of ways that Facebook allegedly made it harder for US workers to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcAGPi"&gt;“Facebook is not above the law, and must comply with our nation’s federal civil rights laws, which prohibit discriminatory recruitment and hiring practices,” Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s civil rights division, said in a statement. “Companies cannot set aside certain positions for temporary visa holders because of their citizenship or immigration status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCZiAc"&gt;Facebook didn’t reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;“While we strongly believe we met the federal government’s standards in our permanent labor certification (PERM) practices, we’ve reached agreements to end the ongoing litigation and move forward with our PERM program, which is an important part of our overall immigration program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x05wkB"&gt;Facebook is going to have a fairly large bill this month (although it probably isn’t much for a &lt;a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FB/facebook/net-worth"&gt;billion-dollar company&lt;/a&gt;), as it racked up fines not only from the US government but also from the UK. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority just slapped Facebook with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736236/facebook-giphy-uk-cma-fine"&gt;$70 million penalty for deliberately withholding information about its Giphy acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg called to testify before the Senate following Instagram reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxT5IOy_V84j4wFXExfuVxYrLJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022359/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LPpZKU"&gt;A top Democrat is demanding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or Instagram chief Adam Mosseri testify before the Senate to explain how the company plans to protect kids in light of new reports that platforms like Instagram can encourage harmful behavior in teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvFvx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf"&gt;In Wednesday’s letter&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the Senate Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on consumer protection, called on the Facebook executives to testify in light of recent reporting from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on how the photo-sharing platform harms young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVIrlB"&gt;“Parents across America are deeply disturbed by ongoing reports that Facebook knows that Instagram can cause destructive and lasting harms to many teens and children, especially to their mental health and wellbeing,” Blumenthal wrote. “Those parents, and the twenty million teens that use your app, have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aflH3n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parents across America are deeply disturbed by ongoing reports that Facebook knows that Instagram can cause destructive and lasting harms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="itGf5G"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnQTWM"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed herself as the source behind the &lt;em&gt;Journal’s &lt;/em&gt;reports earlier this month in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Haugen appeared before Blumenthal’s committee to explain the internal reports and surveys she obtained while employed on Facebook’s Civic Integrity group to lawmakers. The hearing focused on documents suggesting that Facebook knew Instagram was “toxic” for teenage users and the platform’s algorithms could lead them to content that encouraged self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJjbaM"&gt;During the hearing, Blumenthal called on Zuckerberg to testify regarding the Instagram revelations. “Rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing,” Blumenthal said at the hearing earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ect7Sg"&gt;The company has yet to confirm whether it plans to offer up Zuckerberg for testimony, but the subcommittee could force him to testify through a subpoena if he refuses. So far, Blumenthal has downplayed the possibility of a subpoena, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-haugen-zuckerberg-congress-demands-answers/6011904001/"&gt;telling CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, “He has a public responsibility to answer these questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgWIo7"&gt;Over the last few weeks, Facebook has faced a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and consumer advocates. In light of Haugen’s leaks, Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate introduced new bills to make platforms like Facebook more liable to harms caused by algorithms by amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yb8TvU"&gt;In light of this growing skepticism and regulatory threats, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook is planning to change its company’s name. The name change could be announced next week and would “reflect [Facebook’s] focus on building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.” The proposed name change arrives as Facebook is bracing itself for more disclosures from Haugen, according to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972?s=20"&gt;Monday Facebook Newsroom tweet thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsCh0p"&gt;“Over the last 6 weeks, including over the weekend, we’ve seen how documents can be mischaracterized,” one tweet said. “Obviously, not every employee at Facebook is an executive; not every opinion is the company’s position.” Facebook has yet to release additional documents addressing these alleged mischaracterizations.&lt;/p&gt;
