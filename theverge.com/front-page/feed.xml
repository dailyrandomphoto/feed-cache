    <title>The Matrix: Resurrections trailer is finally here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFR5hwfo6CUb3K-VVEApFqIMPRY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834037/matrix_resurrections_trailer_pic.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YUoE2T"&gt;The long-awaited trailer for the fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; installment is finally here alongside the film’s official title: &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections.&lt;/em&gt; The trailer for &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; was first previewed at a CinemaCon presentation from Warner Bros. Pictures on Tuesday, August 24th, in Las Vegas before being released to the public today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRZl9L"&gt;The trailer features clips of Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Neil Patrick Harris playing the role of Neo’s therapist. “Am I crazy?” Neo asks, as his pre-awoken Thomas Anderson persona. “We don’t use that word in here,” Harris’ character replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OZR1WP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s time to fly” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYlCzu"&gt;The trailer also depicts what is widely suspected to be a young Morpheus (played by franchise newcomer Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) telling Neo that “it’s time to fly” while handing him a red pill (though Fishburne himself was &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/laurence-fishburne-in-conversation.html#_ga=2.54469992.1368255391.1629876116-1101500005.1612619158"&gt;not asked&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; sequel). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EEruLxjjhECCeVPs1jQBDrdBPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836627/rev_1_MX4_TRLR_0012_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the name of the coffee shop in the background: Simulatte. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jWsEc4WTdZRh2EGOQmLHmhYBHjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836626/rev_1_MX4_TRLR_0002_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss will reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eicu0M"&gt;The trailer is full-on nostalgia for &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fans. Neo must once again follow a woman to learn the truth, only this time, the white rabbit he’s trailing after isn’t a tattoo on her shoulder, but Jefferson Airplane’s classic song pumping along as blue pills spill into a sink. Explosions? Oh yeah, and plenty of physics-defying karate kicks. We’re also left to ponder what’s real and what’s simulated along a shifting timeline in true &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYMsE7"&gt;“After all these years to be going back to where it all started... back to the Matrix,” says another new addition to the franchise, Jonathan Groff, as the trailer ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jpzm7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; is written and directed by Lana Wachowski, who co-directed and co-wrote the first three Matrix films with her sister Lilly Wachowski. The film is scheduled to premiere exclusively in theaters on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQC1M7"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660926/the-matrix-resurrections-teaser-red-blue-pill"&gt;fans were treated to a unique teaser website&lt;/a&gt; that presented different tiny snippets of the trailer depending on when you logged in — and, of course, whether you chose the red or blue pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PZOoGq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Matrix: Resurrections teaser presents fans with a familiar choice","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660926/the-matrix-resurrections-teaser-red-blue-pill"},{"title":"Here’s what The Verge wants out of a fourth Matrix movie","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Marvel Unlimited relaunches with exclusive phone-optimized comics and a fresh new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA0l1QXVYm5-fQ2pfG6gfWehuL4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834003/marvel_unlimited.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTCyop"&gt;Marvel Unlimited — the company’s all-you-can-read subscription comics service — is getting overhauled today with a new logo, an updated app, a more streamlined design, improved search, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yC9vXk"&gt;And as part of the relaunch, Marvel is also announcing an addition to the service: “Infinity Comics,” a new line of exclusive comics that have been specifically designed for the vertical form factor of a modern smartphone, with scrolling panels that fill the entire width of a phone or tablet screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORixHi"&gt;Marvel is investing big on Infinity Comics, too. It’ll launch with 27 comics available today, with plans for over 100 by the end of the year. Infinity Comics will be exclusive to Marvel Unlimited subscribers, but they’ll be fully in-universe (meaning that anyone who wants to keep up on the full adventures of Marvel’s superheroes will want to make sure to check them out). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1mnFDV4HtSmCxs6304_OCmMSaE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836596/MU_DEVICE_GIF_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A scrolling Infinity Comic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10ZgBZ"&gt;There are some big names attached to the project, including the Jonathan Hickman-led &lt;em&gt;X-Men Unlimited &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Skottie Young’s &lt;em&gt;Giant-Size&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Little Marvels.&lt;/em&gt; Infinity Comics will also feature new Captain America, Black Widow, Amazing Fantasy, Deadpool, Shang-Chi, and Venom / Carnage comics, with plans to roll out new issues on a weekly basis. For now, Infinity Comics are only available on the Marvel Unlimited apps on iOS and Android, although the company plans to add a web reader for subscribers in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvE9MB"&gt;While Infinity Comics are the biggest change, Marvel Unlimited is also getting a fresh design to go with it. The design is an almost Netflix-style look that features a big marquee for major events and tie-ins, scrolling carousels of recommended content, storylines, characters, and creators, and new reading guides for guiding newcomers to comics or for following a crossover event. The Marvel Insider loyalty program is also now integrated into the app, where members can earn points for starting (and finishing) comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5aLlZCI-XDvYXeHKZN7XK_WR-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836566/1080x1080_Creator_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7GNsHOWjcM9FMMsOWFngoH7a-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836565/1080x1080_Character_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Feht5y"&gt;The relaunched app also aims to make browsing and following comics and creators easier and more enjoyable. Starting today, subscribers will be able to locally download an unlimited number of comics, instead of the previous limit of just 12 issues. Users will also be able to save an entire series or run of issues to their libraries with one tap, instead of having to laboriously save individual issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn3xKO"&gt;Another major addition is the ability to follow specific comics, creators, or characters. If you’re a fan of Al Ewing’s &lt;em&gt;Immortal Hulk&lt;/em&gt; line, for example, you’ll be able to follow Ewing and get notified whenever he has new books out on the app. Or if you want to keep up with every Spider-Man comic, you’ll be able to follow the character and easily find whenever there’s a new book available. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tid5TQXlUgjgdRfVMtv_-3tBfdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836562/1080x1080_Downloads_WhiteBG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Unlimited now allows for unlimited downloads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07Kroo"&gt;As of today, Marvel Unlimited features over 29,000 comics and costs $9.99 a month or $69 a year, which makes it a pretty good deal for Marvel fans looking to read absolutely every Marvel comic. That said, despite the relaunch, Marvel is still keeping the service’s biggest caveat: it operates on a three-month delay from when comics are first published in print and digital to when they’re available for subscribers in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1GGdB"&gt;In addition to the redesign, Marvel Unlimited is including a new subscription tier. The “annual plus” subscription costs $99 year and has a few extra perks, including membership kits, promises of in-person event invites, and a 10-percent discount code at Disney’s online shop. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon starts making its own TVs with new Fire TV Omni and 4-Series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0wL36iIzO6E99C-S3lJEBXKKGw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833905/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kt3yTi"&gt;Amazon is officially in the TV business. The company has announced its first lineup of Amazon-branded 4K Fire TVs, which will begin shipping in October. This is a major expansion from the company’s “Fire TV Edition” collaborations, where its popular streaming software comes preloaded on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607331/amazon-best-buy-toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-f50"&gt;sets manufactured by other TV makers&lt;/a&gt;. But with its new Omni and 4-Series, Amazon is describing these as “Amazon-built TVs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEGsn7"&gt;The Omni series is the higher-end of the two, and beyond offering better picture quality, its other key selling point is hands-free voice control. Amazon includes far-field microphones in each model of the Omni series, which comes in 43, 50, 55, 65, and 75 inches. (Only the 65- and 75-inch models have Dolby Vision, but the others at least get HDR10.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTOdb"&gt;The company believes that by building the TV itself, it can create a more seamless Fire TV user experience than ever before. That’s led by the content-forward Fire TV interface and wide app selection, but Amazon believes that Alexa voice controls add a major convenience factor. On Omni sets, voice commands are always available — even if the TV is off. These voice commands can be used for finding something to watch, like always, but you can also adjust the TV’s brightness, volume, or switch inputs with Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRib6K"&gt;Amazon says that over the last two years, customers who used voice features engaged with content twice as much as those who didn’t. And always-listening mics are becoming more common on TVs; Sony already makes some models with them, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;TCL recently introduced new Google TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will ship with far-field microphone arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpTTbQ"&gt;The Fire TV Omni sets also include picture-in-picture for checking your smart home cameras, and you’ll see your Ring doorbell feed whenever someone is at the door. Amazon says it will be adding a “smart home dashboard” later this year for more comprehensive controls over your connected home gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIsK3E"&gt;Here are other new features that are in the works for Fire TV, which will come to these TVs and the company’s other streaming devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0tRtxv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, what should I watch?”:&lt;/strong&gt; Need a new source for great movie and TV recommendations? Alexa Conversations for Fire TV allows you to ask Alexa for a recommendation just like you would a friend or movie expert. Alexa offers tailored TV show and movie recommendations from your favorite streaming apps like Prime Video, allowing you to refine searches by genre, actors, award-winning movies, and more, all from the comfort of your couch. “Alexa, what should I watch?” will launch in beta this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYBbHV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, Play Something” from Netflix:&lt;/strong&gt; Exclusively available on Fire TV and debuting this fall, Netflix is making it easier to find something to watch. Netflix members love the “Play Something” feature today, and soon you can simply say, “Alexa, Play Something on Netflix” from the Fire TV home screen and Netflix will launch a show or movie you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6kbtj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alexa, play TikTok”:&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV was the first to support TikTok videos on streaming media players in the UK, Germany and France, and soon, you’ll be able to access TikTok content in the U.S. and Canada. No more huddling around a cell phone to see the latest viral video&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;from your Fire TV, you can view and discover TikTok feeds and use AutoPlay, which will serve a continuous content feed without interruptions. Just say, “Alexa, play TikTok” to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zS6VVD"&gt;If you already own Echo speakers like the Echo Studio (or a pair of regular Echos), those can be wirelessly linked to Omni-series TVs to provide richer audio than the TV is otherwise capable of on its own. This Alexa home theater audio mode supports streamed content, but Amazon says it also works across cable boxes, gaming consoles, and over-the-air antenna programming. It’s a feature that’s also available on the cheaper Fire TV 4-Series sets. Amazon says a pop-up will appear in the Alexa app for compatible sound devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNc-KKESps_w746c6hY46OMktxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836518/Fire_TV_4_Series_front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV 4-Series doesn’t have far-field microphones and instead includes an Alexa Voice Remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0idpZG"&gt;Amazon might call these “Amazon-built” TVs — and the company’s advanced far-field mic tech is definitely present — but it’s also very likely that Amazon has struck partnerships for much of the other hardware here. I’m almost certain that TCL is manufacturing one or both of these TV lineups. They definitely have that TCL look to them, and the port layouts between something like the TCL 6-Series and Fire TV Omni are nearly identical:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_z9sxd-fLMCdM6sBgpaHFLls4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834622/HDMIcomparo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: TCL / Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 6-Series Roku TV (left) and Amazon’s Fire TV Omni (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mTqNL1"&gt;If that’s the case, these aren’t TCL’s latest and greatest panels: Amazon’s Fire TVs lack HDMI 2.1 features like 4K at 120Hz, though they do support auto low-latency mode — which Amazon says will also help the responsiveness of its Luna cloud gaming service. Amazon also isn’t really going into specifics about whether they’ve got full-array local dimming or other display tech details. Similar to the existing roster of Fire TV Edition sets, the prices for Amazon’s first TVs reflect a focus on providing a good, if not top-tier picture for your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0PtWo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire TV Omni Series pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NanHoE"&gt;75-inch: $1,099.99 (with Dolby Vision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uHvPxZ"&gt;65-inch: $829.99 (with Dolby Vision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ioGUjp"&gt;55-inch: $559.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8rwqKb"&gt;50-inch: $509.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eSb4Fe"&gt;43-inch: $409.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cPArUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire TV 4-Series pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hbkt6b"&gt;55-inch: $519.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fsX23C"&gt;50-inch: $469.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FvJyr6"&gt;43-inch: $369.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gGvAV0"&gt;Alongside its first “self-built” TVs, Amazon and Best Buy are also announcing more Fire TV sets from Toshiba and Pioneer. Toshiba’s models, coming in spring 2022, will integrate far-field microphones, and Pioneer will release budget-priced 43-inch and 50-inch sets. (This is “Pioneer” in branding only, which might be hard to swallow for those who fondly remember the Pioneer Kuro plasma from many years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MfkgN"&gt;In some ways, the Omni and 4-Series represent Amazon’s most ambitious step into the living room yet. But even for customers who aren’t shopping for a new TV, the company’s goal remains having a Fire TV product for everyone. Between these TVs, streaming sticks, and products like the Fire TV Cube, Amazon’s lineup is getting quite expansive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max adds Wi-Fi 6 and faster performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfZNWFTy154pj-MZ9NXdqdfN9HI=/0x146:2040x1506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833896/Fire_TV_Stick_4K_Max.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMC707"&gt;Amazon is today introducing a new flagship streaming stick that joins the Fire TV Stick 4K, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt;, and Fire TV Stick Lite. Dubbed the “Fire TV Stick 4K Max” (&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;) and priced at $54.99, the company’s latest device has improved processing power, more memory, and also adds speedier Wi-Fi 6 wireless networking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GAyd1"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 40 percent faster than the Fire TV Stick 4K, and Amazon attributes those gains to its new quad-core 1.8GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. It’s also now got a faster 750MHz GPU, and Amazon has added auto low-latency mode to help get the best possible performance out of its Luna cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHsjxK"&gt;Amazon claims Wi-Fi 6 is something that can’t be found in streaming gadgets for under $179. (That’s a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;the 2021 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re wondering.) The company thinks it’s a significant addition for more robust, reliable streaming. In another first for Amazon’s Fire TV lineup, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max has received Energy Star certification. Its low power mode has improved to use 15 percent less power than the low power mode on the existing Stick 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKcmQL"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max comes with Amazon’s Alexa Voice Remote — now with branded shortcut buttons — and runs the refreshed, content-focused software experience that rolled out across the Fire TV lineup earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoJGXA"&gt;Amazon says the Fire TV Stick is the best-selling streaming player in the United States, so it’s trying to keep that momentum going strong with this new model that still manages to come in under the $60 mark. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Luna is expanding to Fire tablets and Chromebooks, and retro games are on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6IaM4liiiGUD9DHKO2-D0czOjM=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833902/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wZdJo8"&gt;Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;didn’t exactly impress us&lt;/a&gt; when it debuted in early access last October, but the company’s &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/lunaupdate"&gt;still expanding its test&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday, it’s bringing its limited catalog of games to Chromebooks and Amazon Fire tablets, and opening up some new ways to try the service without paying its $6 or $15 monthly fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ak2KSf"&gt;Technically, the service is still in early access — most people have to request access to play, and only in the contiguous United States. But Amazon’s extending its immediate approval signups to its own Fire tablets, the same way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298746/amazon-luna-expanding-fire-tv-devices-invite-only"&gt;it extended them to Fire TV devices&lt;/a&gt;. By the way, there’s a new one of those today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22427026"&gt;Amazon also just announced its new Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a special auto low-latency mode for Amazon Luna that might help with performance. You can buy it bundled with a Luna Controller for $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKCuqo"&gt;But even if you don’t have an Amazon device, the company’s making Luna easier to try. There’s a new “Luna Couch” mode that lets you accept an invite code from a friend to play local multiplayer games including &lt;em&gt;Team Sonic Racing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2 &lt;/em&gt;even if you aren’t a subscriber. And until September 15th, Amazon will let anyone with a Prime account in the contiguous US play &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Katamari Damacy Reroll&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; for free, no need for a Luna account at all. The company says that promotion should be available &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/luna/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMKtf-9b9mJsHFIC6oyN232frVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835973/Amazon_Luna_Couch_Code.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luna Couch lets you share a “couch code” to quickly invite someone else to a game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LyiSp7"&gt;And if $6 a month for Amazon’s standard “Luna+” collection of games is too much to ask, there’s a new $2.99 a month Family Channel today you could subscribe to instead. Amazon describes it as “a curated collection of games appropriate and approachable for gamers of all ages” with 35 games, including “&lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Garfield Kart – Furious Racing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Otter Charlie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DreamWorks Dragons: Dawn of New Riders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;,” and a title called &lt;em&gt;Skatebird&lt;/em&gt; coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLERhf"&gt;You should also know that the price of Amazon Luna’s Ubisoft channel is going up on September 30th, though, to $17.99 a month. If by some chance you’re a lapsed subscriber, you’ve got until the 29th to lock in the current $14.99 per month pricing in time for the day and date releases of &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Riders Republic &lt;/em&gt;in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eabWi7"&gt;There’s also a new retro gaming channel coming “soon,” with pricing TBD, that will include &lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Lair&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;King of Fighters&lt;/em&gt;, and others from publishers like Atari and SNK, according to Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 teaser gives first real-world look at the upcoming phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0cbAxukO4kFJ6C-w_HAhFCDzDgU=/2x0:2159x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833619/msedge_1F6PdUaNul.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBfFyK"&gt;Google has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pixel 6 that includes several shots of the smartphone being used in the real world. The footage comes a little over a month after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;released its first official images&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming device, which were limited to renders rather than actual photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcAqUL"&gt;Over on its Instagram page, Google has also teased the phone in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTkyMwagXN9/?utm_medium=share_sheet"&gt;new post&lt;/a&gt; which may give some hints about when its official launch might take place beyond “this fall.” As &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/09/google-teases-the-pixel-6-and-its-possible-launch-date-in-new-ads/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the clock widgets in these images show the date as “Tue 19th.” And yes, the 19th of October falls on a Tuesday. That’s a little later than when Google announced the Pixel 5 last year (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21456181/google-pixel-5-features-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;September 30th&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s definitely the right ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3EburS"&gt;

The Pixel 6 is coming in two versions. There’s a Pixel 6 Pro which will have a 6.7-inch 120Hz QHD+ curved display, and three rear cameras including an ultrawide and a 4X optical-zoom folded telephoto lens. Meanwhile the regular Pixel 6 will have a slightly smaller 6.4-inch 90Hz FHD+ flat display, and no telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s first original film is Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TxBKp"&gt;Roku’s first feature-length film is &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt;, a TV movie based off the NBC show &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/09/the-roku-channel-inks-deal-for-lionsgate-s-zoey/ja-etsog-1631082817"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The film will be available free on the ad-supported Roku Channel in the US this holiday season, as well as in Canada and the UK. The film will be directed by Richard Shepard (who directed the show’s original pilot), and written and executive produced by the show’s creator Austin Winsberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlzV9e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt; marks the latest step in Roku’s foray into original content, which kicked off with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;acquisition of defunct streaming service Quibi’s&lt;/a&gt; library earlier this year. Since then it’s launched its own &lt;em&gt;Roku Recommends&lt;/em&gt; show, and has ordered additional seasons of ex-Quibi shows &lt;em&gt;The Most Dangerous Game&lt;/em&gt; and Kevin Hart’s &lt;em&gt;Die Hart.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQMMSU"&gt;“We are absolutely thrilled to call ‘Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas’ our first Roku Original film and make it available to both longtime fans and new ones on The Roku Channel this holiday,” said Roku’s head of original scripted programming Colin Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LaWoGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are absolutely thrilled to call ‘Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas’ our first Roku Original film”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky27JF"&gt;Historically Roku has best been known for its inexpensive streaming hardware, and to a lesser extent the smart TV OS it provides to TV manufacturers like TCL and Hisense. But the Roku Channel is part of its increasingly important advertising business, and the company’s CEO Anthony Wood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595384/roku-ceo-anthony-wood-ads-hardware-business-interview-business-model"&gt;has been pretty open&lt;/a&gt; about seeing Roku’s future as an ad-focused company rather than a hardware-focused one. Earlier this year, Roku acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308141/roku-nielsen-video-advertising-business-acquisition-linear-streaming-tv"&gt;Nielsen’s video advertising business&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to build out its ad tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6j8hb"&gt;In addition to the new film, Roku says that all 25 episodes of &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt; will be available to stream on The Roku Channel in the US “later this fall.” The show originally ran for two seasons on NBC, before being cancelled earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4elDm7"&gt;As well as Roku-branded hardware, The Roku Channel is available on the web, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, select Samsung TVs, Now devices, and Sky Q, depending on your country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj8yJq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Twitter’s communities could bring context back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cenBKD8bjO22tnuNJaKbSZZURlI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833456/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Moderators say smaller groups are helping them block trolls and build community&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="isreQA"&gt;One of the most useful concepts for understanding why social networks so often drive us to despair is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse#cite_note-1"&gt;context collapse&lt;/a&gt;: taking multiple audiences with different norms, standards, and levels of knowledge, and herding them all into a single digital space to coexist. Predictably, this regularly leads to conflict — and, at the scale of an entire country, may even make us more polarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoP5MG"&gt;Nowhere has this all been more true than on Twitter, Earth’s public chat room. Bringing together hundreds of millions of people into a text-based daily competition for attention has resulted in that familiar litany of problematic content: misinformation, influence operations, scams, harassment and abuse. Like its peers, Twitter removes a lot of that stuff. But what remains can be just as annoying or hurtful: the &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys"&gt;Reply Guy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sealioning-internet-trolling"&gt;sea lion&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe worst of all, the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/12/dunking-is-delicious-and-also-probably-making-twitter-terrible.html"&gt;quote-tweet dunker&lt;/a&gt;, who shows up in your timeline just to clown on you because your 280-character post failed to account for all forms of lived human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15IiOa"&gt;The result is too often a social network that, to a user with even a moderately large following, feels booby-trapped. Whether you say the right thing or the wrong thing, it will inevitably get misconstrued by someone, and suddenly you’ve wasted an afternoon explaining yourself to people seemingly determined to misunderstand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD5BEC"&gt;When people call Twitter “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=this%20hellsite&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;a hell site,&lt;/a&gt;” this is often what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xXcJg"&gt;But what if you could build a version of Twitter that kept out the Reply Guys and the sea lions, and included only people who had some shared context around a subject or interest? That’s the idea between &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/testing-communities"&gt;the company’s launch of Communities&lt;/a&gt;, a way to create semi-public groups where only members can participate in conversations. Here’s Alex Heath at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MCiZHA"&gt;Starting Wednesday, Twitter users can be invited to an initial batch of Communities that include #AstroTwitter, #DogTwitter, #SkincareTwitter, and #SoleFood (a group for sneaker enthusiasts). Once people join a Community, they can tweet directly to other members rather than to just their followers. Only members of a Community can like or reply to tweets sent by other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uge1tT"&gt;Similar to how groups on Facebook and Reddit’s subreddits work, each Twitter Community will have its own moderators who are able to set rules and invite or remove people. Twitter invited a handful of users to create the first Communities and will let anyone apply to create their own &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/communities-interest"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ShMrhz"&gt;In his thread about the test, Twitter product chief Kayvon Beykpour said he hopes Communities will make people feel more comfortable tweeting. “Tweets you post in Communities are ‘narrow-casted’ to only the people in that Community,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1435672770843590658?s=21"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re still public tweets, but they aren’t amplified to all of your followers and they don’t show up on your profile. We think this can help lower the pressure of talking on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hOAGMM"&gt;
&lt;p id="Xam3M6"&gt;To get some sense of how this is working in practice, I spent the day messaging moderators of various Twitter communities. Collectively, they’re optimistic that these groups can make Twitter a little more fun to spend time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR5gtn"&gt;Josh Ong, who moderates &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/communities/1435307090197684225"&gt;a Twitter community&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-tiny-tokens-challenging-platform"&gt;non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt;, told me that it had often been difficult to discuss the complexities of cryptocurrencies in front of his nearly 40,000 Twitter followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CMmNii"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Communities gives us the option to separate those conversations when it makes sense.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv9LKK"&gt;“The NFT conversation can be particularly high-context, from technical jargon, our own memes, and the random menagerie of the latest projects and their respective animals,” Ong said. “I’ve always loved how Twitter was a set of loosely interlocked conversations about specific interests, but that came with its own frictions too. Communities gives us the option to separate those conversations when it makes sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo7fMq"&gt;Communities could also help with one of the core problems for people tweeting about NFTs: scammers showing up trying to steal from them. Twitter has a years-old problem in which people create accounts pretending to be Elon Musk and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56402378"&gt;perpetrate various Bitcoin scams&lt;/a&gt;, and new grifts are bubbling up all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2O9IY"&gt;“One thing I’m excited about for the NFT community is not having automated scammers commenting when we use specific words,” Ong said. “For instance, the word ‘Metamask’ is targeted by an army of bots posting fake customer support forms trying to phish for details.” (&lt;a href="https://metamask.io/"&gt;Metamask&lt;/a&gt; is a popular crypto wallet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlkNRl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shawtyastrology"&gt;Shawty Astrology&lt;/a&gt;, who tweets about horoscopes to 111,000 followers, told me her posts can sometimes draw attention from trolls trying to hijack the conversation. She’s now a moderator on Twitter’s astrology community, and said it felt like “a safer environment to share their information and knowledge with other people in a like-minded environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqX6cS"&gt;Matt Nelson had a different problem. He runs&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates"&gt; We Rate Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, an account with 9 million followers that does just what you would expect from the name. (His tweets are often &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/1434543455682826241"&gt;incredibly good&lt;/a&gt;. The account is beloved for good reason.) Nelson is now a moderator of Twitter’s dogs community. He told me he likes the idea of a dedicated home on Twitter for dog lovers — and a more limited group to interact with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjsY50"&gt;“We currently can’t interact with everyone who engages with our account. There’s too many!” Nelson said. “We wish we could reply ‘omg’ to every pic we’re sent. And a dedicated community allows that exclusivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhO95n"&gt;“But it’s more about what it does for our audience,” he added. “If they want to escape to a world only about dogs, now they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Z5ySix"&gt;
&lt;p id="u39B2f"&gt;This afternoon, Ong invited me to be the 229th member of the Twitter NFT Community. Like the rest of the NFT-obsessed internet, it’s awash in colorful, cartoon profile pictures of animals: a variety of sharks, birds, and especially apes. And the chatter there was notable for its friendliness: one artist announced he would give away some NFTs he created free to anyone who asked for the next 10 minutes, and the community responded with a joy I have not seen on my timeline in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFUPd1"&gt;The community chatter arrived at a steady clip — not quite as fast as you would find in a popular Discord server about NFTs, perhaps, but more rapidly than you would find on the more orderly, hierarchical Reddit. More than anything else, I was struck by the sense of possibility that the community had seemed to inspire in its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R0hpAq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a joy I have not seen on my timeline in the last decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syoBK6"&gt;One member suggested community-only Spaces for live audio discussions, which would be a natural fit for the product. Another, taking advantage of the handful of invitations given each member, announced that he had invited MC Hammer to join the group. “We’ll see,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KclDXn"&gt;Of course, groups have their downsides. Facebook’s groups product has regularly run into criticism for hosting &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-violence-misinformation-a3dc1c9479e7677d6d34b4bae7dc9680"&gt;extremism&lt;/a&gt; and misinformation, particularly&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22319681/vaccine-misinformation-facebook-instagram-spreading"&gt; related to vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. The same thing that can make groups fun to use — the posts are less visible to outsiders, and can therefore build a sense of shared purpose — also makes them harder to police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg95Uf"&gt;And even if Twitter navigates those issues successfully, it’s still unclear how its groups product will fare against some fairly robust competition. Facebook Groups, Reddit, especially Discord have been thriving lately, and the latter two have been built from the ground up to promote the kind of group discussions that Twitter is only now getting around to bolting on to the core product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwmrGP"&gt;But as someone who has created not one but &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;alt Twitter accounts to explore my least popular interests (indie rock and pro wrestling, thanks), I’m happy to see Communities arrive. Context is returning to Twitter after all these years. And we’ve never needed it more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s e-bike concepts are motorcycles outside the city, bicycles within</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_M2Dy2C5g6sbHgadmLhc6qYy7s=/17x0:6640x4415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833375/P90434283_highRes_bmw_i_vision_amby_in.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW’s two concept e-bikes envision geofencing to limit speeds inside cities.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gfmgU1"&gt;BMW recently showed off not &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341396EN/the-bmw-i-vision-amby"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341574EN/bmw-motorrad-vision-amby"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; e-bike concepts. The announcements are sprinkled with tons of gee-whiz claims that are easy to make when something only lives on paper, not roads. But one idea stood out to me as a real solution: the use of geofencing to limit fast e-bike speeds inside congested cities. Especially since BMW already has a working geofencing solution deployed around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukGDnA"&gt;In Europe at least, fast e-bikes known as speed-pedelecs (or Class 3 e-bikes in the US) are capable of going 45km/h (28mph), just like BMW’s new concept bikes, the &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341396EN/the-bmw-i-vision-amby"&gt;BMW i Vision AMBY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341574EN/bmw-motorrad-vision-amby"&gt;BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C71Paa"&gt;BMW sees the i Vision as a pedal-assisted e-bike fitted with a massive 2,000Wh battery that’s “fast charging,” naturally, for a range of up to 300km (186 miles). The Motorrad Vision, meanwhile, would have a throttle and footrests like a traditional motorbike. Both would have three speeds moderated for different types of roads. 25km/h (15.5mph) on bike paths, up to 45km/h (28mph) on roads within cities, and 60km/h (37mph) on multi-lane roads beyond the city limits. The bikes would also be fitted with proximity radar to alert the rider with a visual and acoustic warning that a vehicle was approaching from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Va4-tKdLOQLlhunu6DNlmTgHPoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836451/P90434288_lowRes_bmw_i_vision_amby_in.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The i Vision is a pedal-assisted e-bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzB4BtWwH0SPQcA2z27vohY9HIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836449/P90434496_lowRes_bmw_motorrad_vision_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorrad Vision is more enduro than e-bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSLKg0"&gt;These vehicles only exist as concepts for now. But what’s interesting is BMW’s inclusion of speed enforcement using geofencing. S-pedelecs, like the impressive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22385197/stromer-st2-review-electric-bike-speed-pedec-l1e-b"&gt;Stromer ST2 I recently reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, are deemed unsafe for protected bike paths in cities like Amsterdam, forcing riders onto busy streets next to aggressive taxis and, let’s face it, entitled BMW drivers who believe nobody but them knows how to drive properly. Although S-pedelec riders are capable of moderating their speeds to ride alongside ordinary bicycles, some choose not to, creating an unsafe disparity. Geofencing could solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Awj2mW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BMW has everything needed to make it a reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8foij"&gt;BMW already has a solution to this sort of problem that it uses in its cars. The company’s so-called &lt;a href="https://discover.bmw.co.uk/article/bmw-launches-world-first-edrive-zones-in-the-uk"&gt;eDrive Zones&lt;/a&gt; communicate with its newer plug-in hybrids to automatically switch the cars into all-electric driving mode when entering certain parts of the cities marked as low emission zones. It works in combination with geofencing tech found in BMW’s GPS navigation system. These eDrive Zones &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/netherlands/article/detail/T0306573NL/bmw-group-edrive-zones-zorgen-voor-beter-leefklimaat-in-stedelijke-gebieden?language=nl"&gt;were first deployed in the four largest Dutch cities&lt;/a&gt; before rolling out to about 80 cities across Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQHWY2"&gt;No wonder geofencing plays such a “central role” in these AMBY concepts: BMW already has everything it needs to make it a reality for e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYZDvp"&gt;A geofencing solution that caps power delivery to S-pedelec pedals within the city limits would put these fast e-bikes back onto the protected bike paths where they belong. It would also help drive the adoption of S-pedelecs as great alternatives to cars for long commutes to and from the city. And that, in turn, would help European cities achieve their environmental goals that led to the creation of these low emission zones in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AFS6"&gt;Current laws don’t account for such speed modulation on light electric vehicles, something BMW recognized when it announced the concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QsuHT0"&gt;“In the absence of any existing legal framework for a vehicle of this kind with a modular speed concept, the ‘AMBY’ Vision Vehicles set out to prompt the introduction of such legislation and by consequence developments of this nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7jg9tj"&gt;A good concept can start a conversation. And if nothing else, BMW has certainly achieved that. Now let’s hope regulators and city planners are paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Blocks? Chains? How does this whole thing work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g4oerr"&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve probably spent the last decade hearing about blockchain technology and all the ways it’ll change the world. And at some point, you’ve probably wondered, “Hey… what the heck even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a blockchain?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZghJgI"&gt;So, like Gandalf giving Bilbo a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22608361/jrr-token-cryptocurrency-one-ring-lord-of-the-rings"&gt;Tolkien-themed cryptocoins&lt;/a&gt; and sending him on an adventure (pretty sure that’s how the story goes), &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; told me to try to learn about and demystify the tech that underlies everything from cryptocurrencies to NFTs. Possibly because my editors want to drive me to the point where I build &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_nTpsv9PNqo?t=20"&gt;an actual red string board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uNVBY"&gt;So, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXrvnHrW70"&gt;shall we begin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yDJS4C"&gt;What is blockchain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="apGwFJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read 1,000 analogies trying to explain the blockchain. Could you give me another one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQWXWt"&gt;You can think of a blockchain like an obsessive club filled with members who love to keep track of things. The club has a ton of complicated rules to make sure that every member writes down the exact same set of records about what happens each day (whether it’s bird sightings, or beer tastings, or flower sales) and that once data is recorded and accepted, it becomes exponentially more difficult to change as more and more records are added on top of it. Then, usually, outsiders can come by and check out all their records and go, “Oh, wow, a cardinal flew by at 10AM in front of Mike’s house. Cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXxfY"&gt;And, of course, there’s an unwritten rule that says you can never stop talking about being in the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FYcK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRGxK"&gt;At their core, blockchains let you agree about data with strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evmbqf"&gt;Public blockchains provide a place to put information that anyone can add to, that no one can change, and that isn’t controlled by any single person or entity. (Generally, at least; we’ll deal with the caveats and exceptions later.) Instead of one company or person keeping track of everything, that responsibility is spread out to everyone on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTM6y9"&gt;These properties are often described with very technical-sounding language like “distributed ledger,” “peer-to-peer,” and “cryptographically hashed,” but these are the basic properties that those words describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMfNOv"&gt;We’ll get into the technical side of &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;all that is done a bit later on, but there are probably a few basics we should cover first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBVVEE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKxJAC"&gt;Blocks are what store data on the blockchain — and it’s up to whoever’s making the blockchain to determine what kind of data they store. I could, if I wanted to, create a blockchain where each block stored the entire text of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;. Would it be efficient? No. Would it be dumb? Yes. Have I done it? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXY2p41fEQFGR48Zy7gRhfgoSVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823807/image2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is, in part, what the code behind a rudimentary blockchain looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5y0CeG"&gt;For normal cryptocurrencies, though, blocks contain the records of valid transactions that have taken place on the network. I sent you a MitchellCoin? Put it in a block. You sent me 10 MitchellCoins in return? That’s so kind of you! That’s in the block, too. For cryptocurrencies, you can imagine blocks as boxes of receipts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwY6Mq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nXqkw"&gt;Let’s say I just made a new blockchain: the first block would be there, shiny and new, but lonely. Then, the second block would come along and say, “the block before me is the first block.” The next block would say “the block before me is the second block,” and so on, creating a chain (of blocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEYzIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello, I’m a blockchain expert, and this is a massive oversimplification. You haven’t mentioned orphaned blocks, block times, forks —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nst4BZ"&gt;Okay yes, blockchain systems are &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;complex, as you’d expect for a system that needs to be able to handle millions of people using it, worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWuhPX"&gt;You definitely could get into galaxy-brain level discussions so thick with jargon that you’d need an entire article just to point you to the proper dictionary, but the extremely basic version is that there are a bunch of blocks that point back to each other in a line. Once a block is made and accepted onto the chain, it can’t be removed without extreme effort. You can only add new blocks. We’ll get into why that is and how the process works in just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGjSjh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, we’re just talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies here, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrO9h3"&gt;Well, yes and no. Cryptocurrencies are built using blockchain technology, and they’re by far the most well-known usage of the tech. At this point, you’ve probably heard of at least three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. All three run on their own, separate blockchains, and there’s way more where those came from, just in the cryptocurrency space alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrCUB0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So blockchains are used by people looking to get rich, but Online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRGPzr"&gt;Well, the oodles of money being thrown around is what gets a lot of attention, but blockchain technology isn’t just limited to financial purposes. Technically, anyone can make a blockchain to keep track of anything, so there could really be infinite blockchains. (I even made a very silly one while writing this article.) There are also companies that run their own blockchains, but we’ll get into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KXvYX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, Mitchell, it’s your mom who, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as you know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, doesn’t keep up with tech news. Why should I care about blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8DRED"&gt;Hi, mom! Great to talk to you again! How was your kayaking trip? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1YrpP"&gt;People talk about blockchain &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, saying that it’s going to revolutionize everything, and that it could be the next internet. I know you weren’t, as you say, born yesterday, so you can tell that those claims may be just &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; grandiose. But there is still the possibility of it supporting fascinating new companies, apps, and systems — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;lucrative ones&lt;/a&gt;, at that — and having a basic understanding of the tech will let you know who’s a huckster and who may actually have interesting ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJGSGK"&gt;Or maybe blockchains could accelerate the climate disaster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648278/ida-hurricane-new-orleans-louisiana-climate-change-storm"&gt;destroying the Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhq1dc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0VXS5"&gt;Nah, you don’t really need to worry about that. I’ve been told it’s perfectly fine, and the problem will go away any day now. [Sweating profusely (because of the climate change)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="73ZrT4"&gt;What is blockchain’s impact on climate change?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ahXKqs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still worrying about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk2y8h"&gt;That may be because you’ve seen stories about how some cryptocurrencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison"&gt;use more energy than Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; or Libya, or you’ve heard that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/business/dealbook/bitcoin-climate-change.html"&gt;Bill Gates is worried about them&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many facets to the discussion about crypto’s energy use that would take several articles to cover (though one of my colleagues does have an excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;deep dive into the controversy&lt;/a&gt;), but it is safe to say that blockchains have a reputation for being environmentally unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9aEk9"&gt;Part of the reason for that is a system called “proof of work,” which many blockchains (especially cryptocurrencies) employ for security and trust purposes. If a blockchain uses proof of work to validate blocks, then it requires a lot of computing power to complete transactions. Since computers need energy to run, transactions end up using a lot of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh0MGf"&gt;It is worth noting that it doesn’t have to be this way: blockchains themselves don’t inherently use a ton of energy, and there are alternatives to proof of work. We’ll get into why that is a bit later. But, at the moment anyway, most of the applications of blockchain technology that people are familiar with, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use proof of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CF4Nq4"&gt;To understand why the proof of work model needs computers to work so hard, we first have to understand how the other parts of blockchain technology operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9owtw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so what does the blockchain look like? Is it a website? An app? An interactive VR experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upP5db"&gt;Blockchains start out life as a completely empty list, with no information at all. Then, the creators will create something called the Genesis Block, which is just the first block in the chain. Unlike every other block, it doesn’t point back to anything. People can then add information to that list over time — what that information looks like, though, depends on what the blockchain is meant for: if it’s a cryptocurrency blockchain, it’ll be a bunch of transactions. If it’s a blockchain meant for tracking lettuce (which you could do, if you really wanted), it’ll probably look a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCS9pV"&gt;If you had to visualize what a blockchain actually looks like, imagine a bunch of receipts ordered into boxes, which are all tied together. Every so often, a new box is added, containing the receipts that were gathered since the last box was added to the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMmCM8"&gt;In this example, the receipts are transactions, and the boxes are blocks. Managing the transactions as they happen, before they make it on to the blockchain, is a network of computers, commonly called nodes, that are running a special piece of software they use to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oBTwa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the nodes saying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf2xMH"&gt;Well, when users do any sort of transaction or change, they’re sending out messages to the entire network, for which the nodes are listening. Let’s use a made-up cryptocurrency named, completely randomly, MitchellCoin. If I wanted to send someone five MitchellCoins, I would broadcast that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffehev"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s stopping me from broadcasting out the message that everyone’s given me all their MitchellCoin? Besides my stand-up morals, of course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uI2ZEl"&gt;When the nodes see messages, they do some checks on it: namely, they’d check to make sure that it was digitally signed by me, to confirm an impersonator isn’t spending my money, and that the message hasn’t been tampered with since I signed it. How the actual signature is made is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s22eJ1eVLTU"&gt;a pretty complex process&lt;/a&gt;, but the end result is a message that is verifiably sent by a specific person — it would be almost impossible to forge (unlike a real signature). This prevents unscrupulous people from falsely claiming that someone else sent them MitchellCoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EIrYs"&gt;Nodes will also check to make sure the transaction is valid (say, by checking I actually have five MitchellCoins to spend, or that the person adding a shipment of lettuce to the blockchain is authorized to do so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plIxuG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uh, is that it? After the node does its verification, the transaction is done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeUObf"&gt;Transactions don’t go through right away. They have to wait for the next block to be added to the chain — a time period that can differ by blockchain. After a block is created and becomes part of the blockchain, all the transactions that are contained in it will become part of the blockchain, too. The process of competing to create that block is known as “mining.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EtLM2"&gt;How the block is mined depends on the model that the blockchain operates on, which we’ll get into in a bit. After a mining node has created a block, it’ll broadcast it out to the world. The other nodes will check to make sure it’s a valid block, then add it to their own ledgers. It’s possible for multiple blocks to be created at once, but eventually the network will end up building more blocks on top of one than the other, making that block part of the official chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vE4Ps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems… pretty easy to mess with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Acofe7"&gt;It does, but blockchains have a few features to prevent tampering. To understand how they do that, you have to understand hashing — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrRzFC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hahahah, blaze it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4CElO"&gt;No, it’s not a weed thing — though the confusion is understandable, given how Bitcoin was, for a time, widely associated with buying drugs on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8RIJW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, why would people buy drugs using a tech where every transaction is publicly available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMtVsQ"&gt;While the raw data of the Bitcoin blockchain is public, it doesn’t include your personal identifying information (or, at least, it shouldn’t). You will have a unique address to identify you as an entity on the blockchain, because you can’t just say “Hey, I’ve got 15 BTC to spend” without &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way of identifying who you are and how many coins you have, but that doesn’t include data like your name or address. (If any purchase or a pattern of purchases reveals your identity, though, it’s all out in the open.) The most high-profile cases were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/13/7538059/silk-road-trial-ross-ulbricht"&gt;in the early days&lt;/a&gt; before governments started &lt;a href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/guides/know-your-customer/"&gt;regulating cryptocurrency exchanges&lt;/a&gt;, but the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409501/feds-arrest-founder-bitcoin-mixer-laundered-cryptocurrency"&gt;still announces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136749/doj-ohio-helix-bitcoin-darknet-cryptocurrency-laundering-crime"&gt;regular busts&lt;/a&gt; of organizations that try to launder Bitcoin for use in illegal marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYnm8p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Sorry, you were talking about hashing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHQTiZ"&gt;Alright, buckle in — this is going to get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KSIah"&gt;Hashing is a cryptographic technique that’s been essential to all sorts of computing &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hans-peter-luhn-and-the-birth-of-the-hashing-algorithm"&gt;since the 1950s and ‘60s&lt;/a&gt;, and blockchains use it to prevent tampering. In blockchains, hashes basically act as unique tags that prevent someone from changing data in a block, or even swapping in a fake block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFcEKa"&gt;Hashing lets you create a string of characters (called the “hash”) from any piece of data. You put a bunch of data in (an entire block) and get a smaller, unique piece of data out (the hash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj6pXw"&gt;To confirm nothing gets tampered with, each block stores the hash of the block before it. That way, if there’s ever a discrepancy between the two places the hash is stored, you’ll know something’s gone wrong (more accurately, your computer will know — you don’t have to manually check the chain yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4AsGy"&gt; Hashes have a few important properties: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YtRDla"&gt;They will always be the same given the same piece of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bE0RTD"&gt;They will completely change if any part of that data changes, even by the slightest amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j0Qh4H"&gt;It’s very easy to double check that a given hash came from a given piece of data, but very difficult to tell what data was given just from the hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffqu2y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7IB0z"&gt;Right, let’s do a quick example. Let’s pretend that when we run the word “blockchain” through our hashing algorithm, we get “ef7797” as a result (in reality, hashes are much longer). If we run “blocchain” through, which is only one letter different, we get “8e809e.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBKPbr"&gt;If we wanted to make sure that we’re looking at the same data that was originally hashed, it would be easy as long as we were using the same program to create our hashes. Running “blocchain” through the hashing program will always result in “8e809e,” no matter who’s doing it. But it would take a very long time to go in reverse: if I wanted to know what someone put into the hashing program in order to get “9ed142,” I’d just have to make guesses until I found the specific word that produces that hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQIKZY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still coming up with a lot of weed jokes, but not coming up with how this relates to blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ulm5nu"&gt;Each block in the chain contains within it the hash of the previous block, which is just what the hashing algorithm spits out when given the piece of data that is the block. If anything about that block were to change (say, a transaction in it, or even the entire block itself), the block’s hash would change, breaking the chain: the next block, which contains within it the hash of the previous block would say “Hey, that block pointing to me isn’t the same one that was pointing to me when I was created! Something’s wrong!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFHaWz"&gt;This all adds up to a system where anyone looking at a new block submitted to the chain can tell that nothing has been changed at any point. If it had, the hashes of every block after the change would have to be different than the ledger up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJaD2u"&gt;By the way, the hashes that blockchain uses are specifically cryptographic hashes. That’s part of the reason for the crypto- prefix that shows up on words like “cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqstv7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I get it, but could you provide a snazzy illustration just in case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhilBI"&gt;You bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wakUUdpBuOJuXUxPRHnlQAV3eeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823873/acastro_210902_4741_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I6ephx"&gt;So how does everyone agree on which version of the blockchain is correct? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="28vpRV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like how are we checking that these hashes match up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xfhwyy"&gt;The exact answer depends on what blockchain you’re talking about, but each one has something called a “consensus algorithm.” Basically, each blockchain decides how it wants to decide what the canonical truth is — generally, it’s based on the chain that has had the most work put into it. In a proof-of-work based blockchain, that means the chain with the most blocks: since every block requires work to mine, the longest chain will be the one with the most work put into it and will therefore be the official chain. (There are some alternative ways of doing it, however, which we’ll touch on later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nylnKz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I wanted to attack this? Like if I spent 5,000 MitchellCoins, how would I change the record to say that I still had those coins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3d4ta"&gt;It would be extremely painful (for your computer, that is). So first what you’d have to do is change the block where that happened. You’d then have to recompute the hash for that block, and every block that came after… And you’d not only have to do that on one computer (which would be hard enough, for reasons we’ll go into in a second), but on enough computers to drown out everyone else who was mining legitimately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oppqgs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds very hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPBI5Z"&gt;That’s the point. That’s how you can have these things exist in public, yet still be reasonably sure that no one is messing with the record. Attacks can and do happen, but when so much computing power is required to pull one off, it’s hard to do without someone noticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeiwQm"&gt;The math changes, however, if there are very few people mining a particular coin. If MitchellCoin were a real thing, and only a few people were mining it on their home computers, it wouldn’t be that hard, or that expensive, for someone to amass 51 percent of the computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5tuK4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The word “blockchain” is starting to feel fake…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBgkTJ"&gt;Ah, that would be the semantic satiation kicking in. That’s the name for the feeling where you’ve heard a word so many times that it loses all meaning. It’s not surprising, given how many times I’ve used the word “blockchain” here. Let’s do it a few more times, just to make sure: blockchain blockchain blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B5USe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So wait, how does this come together to actually make a block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTlypZ"&gt;Well, when two nodes love each other very much…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laPGGG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4HdsV"&gt;Sorry. So how a block gets made, or “mined” depends on the blockchain itself. One of the most popular systems is called “proof of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pwyimw"&gt;Proof of work systems are… complex, but we’ve already covered most of what we need to know to understand them. Basically, the blockchain will have certain rules for what it wants hashes to look like for blocks. Let’s say, for instance, that the MitchellCoin blockchain requires the first five characters of the hash to all be the letter a (so that it’s constantly screaming, like I am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaIsnj"&gt;When a mining node wants to create a block, it would take all the data in the block, plus a special number called a nonce, and run it through the hashing algorithm. If the hash doesn’t start out as “aaaaa,” it would increase the nonce by one, and start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDv6T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So basically, your computer is just… guessing numbers until it gets to the hash it wants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UJgHz"&gt;Pretty much, yeah. And the hashes are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; — I’ve been using just a couple of characters as examples, but in general the hashes are 60+ characters long. On average, your computer will have to make a ton of guesses before it finds one that meets the criteria. But, again, while it takes us a long time to figure out an appropriate hash, it takes almost no time at all to check to make sure that our data actually does hash out to what we say it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkN1Nd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, it’s me, your computer that’s mining for crypto. Why are you making me work so haaarrrddd?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ6D9V"&gt;Oh no, the AI revolution has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDxqA3"&gt;But really, the difficulty is an important part of the system, because it dictates the security of the block, as well as defining how blocks are made. As we noted before, if you wanted to change a record, you’d both have to recompute the hash for both the block and each subsequent block, as well as win the right to mine each of those blocks. The same is also true for double spends, which is where you try to undo a transaction so you can spend those coins again. The odds of you being able to double spend coins, and then create enough blocks afterward to make a chain long enough to be recognized as legitimate aren’t great. And, if you have enough computing power to tilt those odds in your favor, it’d likely be more profitable to just mine legitimate blocks instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYHhL0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So getting back to the energy thing…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWMxM"&gt;Right, so when you’re creating, or mining, blocks each guess you make takes time and electricity, whether it’s right or not. And that adds up. But, as mentioned before, that’s what makes the blockchain secure — it would take a lot of time and energy to rewrite the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFf4FI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like blockchains are really dumb and wasteful then! Throw them in the trash!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4aE6l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[chanting] Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnr6QX"&gt;Well the good news is that, while proof of work may be popular, it’s not the only way to do things. There’s also proof of stake systems, where, instead of solving puzzles, people put up crypto as a collateral to get a chance at being the next person to mine a block and be asked to validate blocks mined by others. If they validate malicious blocks, they’ll lose some or all of that money, depending on the blockchain’s rules. Proof of stake blockchains require way less energy, because mining a block doesn’t require making millions of guesses — those with stakes are randomly or algorithmically chosen to create a block, and they won’t need specialized, ultra-powerful hardware to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkXOpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If proof of stake makes it easy to mine, what would keep people from wanting to mess with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezjkPC"&gt;Well, an argument for proof of stake is that it incentivizes miners to actually care about the currency, since they have to be &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp"&gt;HODL&lt;/a&gt;ers. Messing with the blockchain would likely reduce confidence in it — making it, and your stake, less valuable. This is in contrast to proof of work miners, who could immediately sell their coins and keep on mining without having to worry too much about the value or stability of the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0TGm"&gt;There have been talks of moving to proof of stake, especially on the Ethereum blockchain for a while, but the upgrade is &lt;a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/"&gt;still in a very early stage&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting, though, that blockchains don’t necessarily have to use proof of work &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; proof of stake — there are other &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-trying-build-better-blockchain/"&gt;alternative consensus algorithms&lt;/a&gt; as well, and blockchains that aren’t public or used for currencies can create blocks in completely different ways that are way more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT54JW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think my brain has kind of melted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5lcXC"&gt;Yeah, as I said it’s a pretty complex system. The good news is that, if you want to use the blockchain, you don’t actually have to know exactly how the system works — just like you don’t have to know how the banking system works to be able to swipe a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7q4nQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of credit cards, hold on a moment. I think I lost my wallet, I could swear I put it somewhere…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brLCZk"&gt;That sounds annoying, but imagine if you had a wallet that you could not only lose, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;forget the password to as well&lt;/a&gt;. Remind me to talk about how those work sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPHnkF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, I found it. Okay, back to the blockchain. Can I just trust anything that’s on it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fi33M"&gt;Oh, no, I wouldn’t recommend that at all. The blockchain provides a way to verify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the data you’re looking at hasn’t been altered. But it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; do much to help you determine whether the data was true when it was entered. There are private enterprise blockchains where every user is known and has specific permissions, but public blockchains are an entirely different beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eURPIm"&gt;For example, say I wanted to sell space rocks and claimed to prove their authenticity using blockchain technology. Even if I figured out a way to provide certificates of authenticity that lived on the blockchain and were indisputably tied to the physical rock I sent you, the blockchain wouldn’t do anything to help you if the “space rock” was actually just a pebble I got from my backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Itunnz"&gt;(Please note: I completely made this up as an example. Any resemblance to someone running a scam with blockchain and space rocks is purely coincidental. Also, if you are doing that… don’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOxtRN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are blockchains just useful for cryptocurrency? Or are there other uses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NXeee"&gt;While cryptocurrencies obviously get all the hype and coverage, there’s tons of experimentation being done with blockchains in a bunch of different fields. Walmart &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/walmart-blockchain-lettuce.html"&gt;has used the blockchain to track produce&lt;/a&gt; from the farm to its stores (and provide easy accountability if there’s a disease outbreak); there are experiments in creating and selling &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-domains-what-are-they-and-how-are-they-implemented-hi2b30hu"&gt;web addresses, or domains&lt;/a&gt;, on top of the blockchain; and there was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cryptocurrency-technology-finds-new-use-tackling-coronavirus-11587675966"&gt;talk at the beginning of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; about tracking supplies and COVID-19 immunity using the blockchain. It does, though, remain to be seen if any of these systems actually catch on and become essential, or if they end up like all those businesses that sprung up in the mid-2010s that said they would use the blockchain without any real idea of what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct2vsh"&gt;There are also, of course, NFTs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG5KhS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recognize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; NFTs! Those are on the blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGJgQt"&gt;They are! Many NFTs exist on the Ethereum blockchain, which has specific features that allow for them. Yes, that does mean that you can do multiple things at once on a single blockchain — it just depends on how the data is set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VcQB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you marry me on the blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSxO3y"&gt;Wow, forward. Uh, no, but there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364647/coinbase-employees-nft-wedding-exchange-romance"&gt;people who have made NFT wedding rings&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, you should probably make sure your partner (who I will reiterate is not me) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redditships/status/1432396694608662536?s=20"&gt;is into that before trying it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sts4wJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aw, okay. Well, will blockchain revolutionize voting / currency / inventory systems / news?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VIFS"&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; blockchain boosters who like to say that the tech is the future of everything, and that it’ll be as big as the internet. However, as with anyone who’s telling you how great something they’re deeply invested in is, you should probably take what they say with 0.001 Saltcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLg7rq"&gt;If a space would benefit in some way from being decentralized, or if everyone needs to share a known-truthful record, then yes, there is a chance blockchain could be a future tech. But if not, then there’s not a ton of benefit to using the technology over, say, a regular database. Blockchains are just a tool like any other — one of IBM’s fellows told me that when it creates blockchains for enterprises, the blockchain is really a small part of a larger IT system that also involves things like databases and other legacy programs. In other words, most of the time companies aren’t just throwing out their old systems and moving to blockchains, they’re integrating them in a way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMPiiY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard explaining how even relatively simple voting systems are trustworthy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmIXRO"&gt;As for voting specifically? Well, there’s certainly some interest in that area — a bill &lt;a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2021/04/15/alaska-would-be-first-state-to-use-blockchain-based-voting-system-under-proposed-bill/"&gt;proposed in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; looks to move the state’s voting system to the blockchain, and a few other places have experimented with the idea. But at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136219/voatz-blockchain-voting-app-election-software-hacking-mit-research-cybersecurity"&gt;one early effort&lt;/a&gt; has shown the increased risks that come with applying new and perhaps unneeded tech to voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7VW02"&gt;For my part, I tend to agree &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs"&gt;with educational YouTuber Tom Scott&lt;/a&gt; on the matter of voting systems using blockchain to do electronic voting — even if the blockchain made voting completely trustworthy (which wouldn’t necessarily be the case), you also have to prove to the general public &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;it’s trustworthy. As 2020 showed, that can be hard to do with low-tech systems, much less ones that require explainers that are, like, a million words long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXDhfa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly, this all really sounds like something I’d like to watch an animated TV show about. Maybe from one of the people behind &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiC8M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441078/fox-blockchain-animated-series-dan-harmon-nft"&gt;I have good news for you...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh49TE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I’d only be interested in it if it had an obvious blockchain-based cash grab tie-in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjKOOo"&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dan-harmon-blockchain-nft-crypto-series-fox-1234954403/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;good news for you&lt;/a&gt; (and bad news for everyone with… taste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNtNze"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to put something on the blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL8lF7"&gt;So it’s actually not a ton of work to make your own blockchain from scratch. There’s some coding involved, to be sure, but it’s honestly not anything that couldn’t be figured out with a few days of research (and some basic programming knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxDeDP"&gt;There’s also no rule that says you have to create your own blockchain — some blockchains, like Ethereum, let you build on top of them, allowing you to take advantage of blockchain technology without having to create your own network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKQ2ph"&gt;But the biggest question you should ask yourself before diving into any of that is, of course: does my thing &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;need to be on the blockchain? Am I trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, potentially using way more energy than is necessary for my application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170Kuw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I really need my thing to run on the blockchain! The fate of nations depends on it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFUYPR"&gt;It’s definitely possible that you’re working on a specific problem that just needs blockchain technology! But if it’s that important then, uh, you really shouldn’t just be learning all this! I wish you the best of luck, though — see you on the ‘chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKfVap"&gt;(By the way, no one says “see you on the ‘chain.” That was a test to see if you’re truly laser eyes enough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvlh1q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laser eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm98e5"&gt;Nope, sorry. This has been long enough, we’ll have to get into that elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DnScD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xiNoLa"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823875/acastro_210902_4741_still.jpg" alt="Illustration of blocks falling into place."&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/3df0ccbd1ae3bee2d74228aae719aab3/acastro_210902_4741_0001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;
