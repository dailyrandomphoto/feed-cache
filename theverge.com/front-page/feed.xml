    <title>WhatsApp fined $267 million for breaching EU privacy law</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbTyQB"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp has been fined €225 million ($267 million) for breaking the European Union’s data privacy rules. &lt;a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry"&gt;Ireland’s Data Protection Commission&lt;/a&gt; (DPC) announced the decision in an &lt;a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf"&gt;89-page summary&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), noting that WhatsApp did not properly inform EU citizens how it handles their personal data, including how it shares that information with its parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJynjX"&gt;WhatsApp has been ordered to make updates to its already lengthy &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; and change how it notifies users about sharing their data. This will bring it into compliance with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which governs how tech companies gather and use data in the EU. GDPR came into effect in May of 2018, and WhatsApp was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17393766/facebook-google-gdpr-lawsuit-max-schrems-europe"&gt;one of the first companies&lt;/a&gt; to be hit with privacy lawsuits under the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6MQpq5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about GDPR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xcxVR7"&gt;A WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will appeal the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNlSjN"&gt;“WhatsApp is committed to providing a secure and private service. We have worked to ensure the information we provide is transparent and comprehensive and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson said. “We disagree with the decision today regarding the transparency we provided to people in 2018 and the penalties are entirely disproportionate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfi9Wd"&gt;The decision by the DPC began with an investigation in 2018 and is the second-largest fine levied under GDPR regulations. In July this year, Amazon was fined a record $887 million for breaching the EU privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrLlEr12ymqvrvZXaKwFhmZDmjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve got the best cheap laptop for you, no matter your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops for video editing, gaming, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3v5Ons"&gt;If you’re shopping for the best cheap laptop of 2021, the question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops. But we’ve tested dozens of systems in the sub-$800 range, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Our other picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestCheapLaptop090121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619562324%26quantity%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $699&lt;/a&gt;, is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $219 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $699 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best thin-and-light laptop under $1000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best budget laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $80 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ve9YBf1z6YDMyDHqVmhcBGp550c=/59x0:1982x1282/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807770/IMG_6828_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Though expensive, the AirPods Max feature fantastic sound and noise cancellation. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRGhSB"&gt;Apple’s notoriously expensive AirPods Max headphones are, in some ways, more of a luxury purchase — but today you can live it up for just a little less thanks to the Woot’s &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals080221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fsounds-of-summer-the-sequel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing “Sounds of Summer” sale&lt;/a&gt;. Well, if you’re an Amazon Prime member that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Now through the end of the month (or while supplies last), &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals090221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime members can save $80&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of the AirPods Max, regardless of color. Woot’s current deal includes a one-year limited warranty from Apple and brings the price down to a cool $470, one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on Apple’s excellent noise-canceling headphones in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugKTpB"&gt;Despite their price, the AirPods Max are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. The Max can easily block out distractions thanks to their active noise cancellation, and Apple’s spatial audio features — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Netflix recently rolled out&lt;/a&gt; to the iPhone and iPad — can help you better immerse yourself in a movie or while listening to music. The AirPods Max also boast excellent sound quality, and feature a breathable knit mesh canopy that makes them comfortable to wear over extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nqI4t"&gt;You can certainly buy a similar high-quality headset like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; for about $200 less, however, this is a solid deal if you’re deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, especially since the AirPods Max also pair seamlessly with other Apple devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w9pVdR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaHwWv"&gt;Want the best drone you can buy for under $500, but forking out $450 for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;latest DJI Mavic Mini&lt;/a&gt; is out of your budget? Well, today you can buy its 2019 predecessor with some added perks — including three sets of spare propellers, a carrying case, a pair of extra control sticks, and a battery charging hub — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RKPP1YL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s for $100 off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsN1zZ"&gt;At less than 0.55 pounds, the DJI Mavic Mini drone is small and light enough that Americans and Canadians don’t need to register it with their governments. Yet, despite the size, it still offers 30 minutes of flight time per battery. The drone also boasts many of the same features found in DJI’s more pricey drones at a more affordable price, like the ability to automatically return to the takeoff spot, making the deal even more attractive at $350. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xe8VnI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can now buy DJI’s leaked $300 Mini SE drone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624171/dji-mini-se-drone-how-to-buy-inexpensive-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="JAHZa0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4YB8m"&gt;Apple lovers, today’s your lucky day: we’ve got a second deal for you. If you’re on the hunt for a tablet that’s the best of its kind, but — well — doesn’t quite cost the typical tablet price, Best Buy’s current deal on the fifth-generation iPad Mini has got you covered. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750770278492463362#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can pick up 64GB, Wi-F-enabled model&lt;/a&gt; for $300 instead of $400 in the color of your choice, saving you $100 on what is considered to be the best small tablet on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzcJqj"&gt;What’s more, the Best Buy deal comes with a few added perks, including a free six-month subscription to Apple News Plus (the digital version) and Apple Music. You can also enjoy discounts on select mice and keyboards, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and more when you purchase the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgbQ1F"&gt;The iPad Mini itself is fast and boasts an A12 processor, the same kind of chip powering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone XS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18011306/apple-iphone-xr-review-camera-screen-battery-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XR&lt;/a&gt;. While it features a range of features, like a 7-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.2 lens, it also comes with old-school favorites like a headphone jack and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6p1iSF"&gt;Note, however, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ipad-mini-6-release-date-price-specs-and-rumors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may be releasing a new iPad Mini soon, so this may not be the latest model for very long. This also means there could be some steep discounts just on the horizon. However, if you want a relatively affordable iPad right now, this is a good deal to grab.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="I8y2lI"&gt;It’s not every day you find a discounted mouse that not only helps you concentrate but improves productivity, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/logitech-mx-master-3-910-005693-wireless-laser-mouse-space-gray/product_24450770?" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staple’s current deal&lt;/a&gt; on the MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse is so great.

&lt;p id="cz7WYS"&gt;The Apple-centric mouse features Logitech’s new MagSpeed magnetic scroll wheel, which the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.910-005693.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F2%2F22652060%2Fapple-airpods-max-dji-mavic-mini-ipad-mini-logitech-mouse-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company claims&lt;/a&gt; make it possible to scroll 1,000 lines in a second. The mouse also aims to help improve productivity with a set of customizable buttons and support for Logitech Flow, a feature that lets you quickly share files and move between computers (or an iPad) by simply dragging your cursor to the edge of the screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a la Apple’s Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect up to a little over two months of power on a full charge, too, and, unlike the last-gen model, the MX Master 3 supports USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What losing Paradise tells us about today’s blazes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Town Of Paradise Wiped Out By The Camp Wildfire Continues Long Struggle To Rebuild" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cz7Q3X_tMqEXSQghvXbFq2fk2UU=/21x0:4770x3166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807720/1129061457.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EaSZSC"&gt;Thousands of Californians have fled their homes this week, as the Caldor, Dixie and other fires &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;continue to blaze&lt;/a&gt; across the state. Despite the best efforts of firefighting teams, the Dixie Fire already torched the small mountain town of Greenville in early August, robbing many residents of a home to which to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRtPXd"&gt;The exodus sparked by each blaze has become an eerily familiar scene as fire seasons in the Western US grow more intense with climate change. Each community that loses part, or all of itself brings to mind the carnage left behind by the Camp Fire in 2018. That’s when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300937/coronavirus-pandemic-california-wildfires-high-school-paradise-climate-change-graduation"&gt;Paradise, California&lt;/a&gt; was nearly wiped off the map, and surrounding communities suffered similar losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR4VUz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paradise is worth being remembered”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DI4NQM"&gt;Journalist Lizzie Johnson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizziejohnsonnn/status/1428456891756257283"&gt;chronicled&lt;/a&gt; much of the damage for the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;and just wrote a powerful book about Paradise and the people who made a home there. &lt;em&gt;The Verge s&lt;/em&gt;poke with Johnson about her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.lizziejohnson.net/book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paradise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and what lessons it might offer as fire season rages again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tby3u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before writing this book, you covered Paradise extensively as a reporter. What do you hope people learn about Paradise that they haven’t heard in the news?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58OLXR"&gt;That fire just changed a lot of things in the state of California and across the West. All of a sudden, we really saw what’s going to be lost, and it was just too big for a newspaper article alone. That was the point when I realized this was something that was really worthy of a book, because Paradise is worth being remembered. It’s worth understanding what happened to that town as we’re facing more and more fires like it in the future, and in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWtkUh"&gt;My focus has always been on understanding what climate change feels like and what the human experience is when your community is totally changed from one of these disasters. What I’m hoping people get from this book is just a sense of what the town was, so it’s not just another abstract disaster. That they really understood its traditions and its culture, and the people that live there and their daily routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzhkGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really appreciated that you included a story from the Konkow tribe about a wildfire that grew out of control generations ago. Why did you weave that through your narrative, and what does it tell us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38bJ9S"&gt;I heard the Konkow legend when I was on a tour with the Butte County Fire Safe Council, a few months after the Camp Fire. And we were standing on this plateau overlooking the community of Concow and everything was still burnt to a crisp. All the trees were blackened matchsticks, and there was ash all over the ground. This couple shared this legend about a fire that was really similar to what we had just seen with the Camp Fire. I think, for a lot of people in that group, it was their first time hearing it. It’s that sort of prehistory that doesn’t get included in lesson plans in school so often, and I just was really struck by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mVy2Un"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s this whole body of knowledge that was lost”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nJXu1V"&gt;There’s this whole body of knowledge that was lost when white settlers came over and stomped fire out of the landscape.  I think that a lot of people sort of forgot that fire is a very natural part. There’s a lot we can learn from Indigenous groups. So I really wanted to make sure they were represented in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PLJa8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning to the Camp Fire, can you walk me through what you have learned about what went wrong that led to so much devastation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkDQzD"&gt;People always want to know the one thing that you can point your finger at. The issue with that is that it’s very, very complicated. It’s a bunch of factors playing at once, which is why it’s hard to find solutions. But basically, the combination of an electrical grid that hasn’t been hardened, that grid is on really flammable land, a lot of forests that are diseased and overgrown and dying that haven’t been managed properly. And then you have these communities like Paradise that are tucked really deep in the forest on fire-prone land, and the houses weren’t built to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzvGNZ"&gt;People use that phrase, perfect storm, but it really was. It was really dry that day, the rains hadn’t come. There was this town in the forest that probably shouldn’t have been there. So when the fire ignited, I mean, it was gone in a matter of hours. It was just insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXUkgw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is difficult to find solutions, but what for you are the key takeaways when it comes to how to prevent something like this from happening again, as the climate crisis makes fire seasons more intense? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NImrB"&gt;The point that I keep coming back to is we need to make sure that we’re having the same conversation, where it’s not just arguing about whether climate change is real or not, but understanding that it is here. And it is changing the landscape in ways that are pretty unfathomable compared to what we knew a few decades ago. You can’t start having solutions unless you’re actually having a conversation about the actual problems, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjjUZj"&gt;The other thing, too, I think, is just realizing that personal preparedness is a really big piece of it. A lot of people see firefighters as these heroes that will come in and rescue them. And when disasters like this happen, at a certain point, they can’t help you. Acknowledging the risk, again, being on the same page, having the same conversation, and realizing that a fire will likely happen if you live in a fire-prone place, and you need to know how to get out and have your go bag. That’s the kind of thing that might save your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAtmzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s the kind of thing that might save your life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXgZuv"&gt;My role as a journalist is to just hold a mirror up to the problem. I wish I had more solutions. But all I can really say is, I think that we need to start being more proactive instead of reactive in terms of preparing for these fires and communities understanding their risk. Even reading about Paradise and understanding what happens there better will help places have conversations about what they can do to improve. You can’t just sit back and think that it won’t happen to our town or that things will get better, because that’s just not the trajectory that we’re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYiO4Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how are the people you wrote about doing now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYk8fm"&gt;You know, it’s hard. I think that a lot of people assume that recovery is this linear thing. And it’s not. There are a lot of people that aren’t that much better off than they were in the year after the fire, particularly now because there’s smoke in the sky. And, you know, the Dixie fire is burning and the Caldor fire is burning, and it’s really really triggering to see other places burn down. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Residents evacuate as the Caldor fire approaches in South Lake Tahoe, California on Monday, August 30, 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j9YMs2"&gt;Jamie and Erin in the book with their daughters just finished rebuilding their home. But even they have talked about how the sky is smoky, and they’re just used to breathing smoke now and how hard that is. Rachelle lost her husband to cancer. So she’s a single mom raising their little baby now. Kevin is student teaching. So again, it’s progress. But it’s not as cheery and linear as you think it would be almost three years after this fire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHcOW1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it like for you now seeing things unfold in Northern California this fire season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7X9A"&gt;It makes me feel really sick to my stomach, to be honest. I was watching videos of the evacuation from South Lake Tahoe yesterday. And again, it just looks so much like what we saw in Paradise and in Butte County during the Camp Fire. There’s this sense that when really, really bad things happen, that you want to feel like there is something to be learned from it, and that it won’t happen again. Even if you intellectually know at some point, another town is going to burn down, it doesn’t make it any easier when it does, having seen up close what that is like and how people struggle afterwards. There’s another town that just joined the ranks of destroyed places and where is going to burn down next? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5lpuh"&gt;That scene seems to repeat itself summer after summer, right? You see the town and then the next time you see it, everything is in ruins. It’s smoking and people are digging through the ashes looking for their china or their wedding rings. And it’s like, how many times can you see people go through that before something changes in a big way?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music startup Roli has filed for administration and is reforming as beginner-focused Luminary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sVXRF2IFRuJloVLXFWhexbc-qI=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807718/JN_200917_ROLI_6342.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roli’s Lumi keyboard and app is like &lt;/em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;em&gt; for learning the piano&lt;/em&gt;.  | Image: Roli&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OGifix"&gt;UK music startup Roli, best known for its squishy keyboards like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/23/9372961/roli-seaboard-rise-grand-hands-on"&gt;the Seaboard Rise&lt;/a&gt;, has filed for administration and is reforming as Luminary. The new company will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572899/roli-lumi-review-features-specs-price"&gt;the Lumi keyboard and app&lt;/a&gt;, which are designed to teach beginners to play the piano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcf7bH"&gt;The news was &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9"&gt;reported by&lt;em&gt; Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that Roli has struggled with generating revenue and growth. The company reported pre-tax losses of £34.1 million ($47 million) from income of £11.4 million ($16 million) in the 18 months leading up to the end of June 2019. The company’s CEO and founder Roland Lamb told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that a limited market for its products had combined with pandemic difficulties to force the closure of Roli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYvgrI"&gt;“Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products we initially developed, although successful within their marketplace, the marketplace wasn’t big enough given our venture trajectory,” Lamb told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “We had our eyes set on hypergrowth and that proved to be difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4nPB8GhBY2W6WUYKXbMknLJWz-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22049948/JN_200917_ROLI_6919.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roli&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light-up keys on the $299 Lumi keyboard help guide beginner pianists. A $79 annual subscription buys access to more songs and lessons. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vfOP8F"&gt;Instead of focusing on selling hardware only, Luminary, née Roli, wants to combine hardware with software subscriptions via its Lumi products. The Lumi keyboard, which uses light-up keys to guide beginners, costs $299, but users can pay an additional $79 for a yearly subscription that gets them access to extra lessons and songs to play along with. It seems, though, that Luminary isn’t completely abandoning the company’s other hardware, and &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports that Luminary will also “reintroduce the Seaboard” at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43RetW"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572899/roli-lumi-review-features-specs-price"&gt;our review of the Lumi last year&lt;/a&gt;, we thought the keyboard and app offered some engaging and inventive ways to tutor new musicians. At a time when the pandemic has made in-person lessons difficult, having a digital tutor could be very beneficial. But not everyone will enjoy Lumi’s hardware, or the price of access.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkEzTg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;notes that Roli’s roughly 70 employees will all be moving to the new business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...?’s art style aims to keep characters ‘feeling monumental and powerful’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mlXfIKrK4wfVcowsbeUmqWMqjUY=/0x0:2622x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807664/102_BEC1120_comp_v001.1033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRzk4q"&gt;Ryan Meinerding has spent much of the last 15 years bringing some of the world’s most iconic superheroes to life. After starting as an illustrator on the original &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, he worked his way up to head of visual development at Marvel Studios and has spent more than a decade figuring out how to bring comic book characters into live-action films. So it was a nice change of pace when he learned about &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;, an animated anthology that takes those very same characters but remixes them in new, and often strange, situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GGRyg"&gt;“I don’t think anyone could have come up with an animated project that I would’ve been more interested in working on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The endless possibilities that are created by having the multiverse, by being able to ask questions like what if, really means that the creativity is just incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z88swX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What If...? is a playful expansion of Marvel’s multiverse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIErt1cw_Y41Ts7mObWclPDPLXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819907/101_ALA0340_comp_v903_20201218_r709.00001793.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DnOsa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; is currently streaming on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and the premise is right there in the name: each episode imagines a different “what if” scenario in which a small moment changes the trajectory of an iconic character. What if an assassin started killing off the Avengers? What if T’Challa became Star-Lord instead of Peter Quill? The most recent episode questions what would happen if Doctor Strange didn’t lose his hands, but instead lost the love of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NvnIO7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What is the version that hasn’t been seen before?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MZdgq"&gt;Visually, all of the characters are recognizable from their live-action appearances, but with a decidedly stylized look. Meinerding says the art style was strongly inspired by famed illustrator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Leyendecker"&gt;JC Leyendecker&lt;/a&gt;, aiming for a look that was both realistic and exaggerated. “The fun of the show is taking something that’s based in reality — in a live-action context — and keeping the animated style relatively realistic,” Meinerding explains. “That’s what Leyendecker did. He stylized and he idealized, but they were always meant to be more real than not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grc5Eb"&gt;Meinerding says the team didn’t explore many different styles; from his earliest days working on &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;, Leyendecker was the goal. “I think we were homing in on Leyendecker because of his ability to stylize, to make characters feel monumental,” he says. “If you’re looking at translating a cinematic universe of superheroes into an animated form, there have been a lot of superhero projects that have been done before… What is the version that hasn’t been seen before, but also keeps them kind of realistic, keeps them feeling monumental and powerful?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9dfBZyzkwmV3NdeayR_GKz7XuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819908/104_EGA0160_comp_v003.1057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G0zoLd"&gt;It was also a chance to have some fun. While the characters in &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; are mostly recognizable, they’ve also been remixed in interesting ways. Steve Rogers remains a skinny kid, and now he pilots a 1940s take on the Iron Man suit. (In the first episode, Peggy Carter receives the supersoldier serum meant for Steve.) T’Challa doesn’t just don Star-Lord’s leather jacket and mask; he changes those around him, turning the Ravagers from a shady criminal syndicate into a Robin Hood-like organization trying to do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yJkJu4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really were just doing our best to keep up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g13cPG"&gt;In the fourth episode, viewers get to see two sides of Doctor Strange, one warped from absorbing powerful creatures. “So much about designing for animation is about silhouette, simplifying, and making characters very readable,” Meinerding explains. “The idea of being able to push Doctor Strange’s collar just &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much farther, so he could feel a little more evil… and also just a little more animated. Each character has a version of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqzc5V"&gt;According to Meinerding, the biggest challenge wasn’t coming up with new ideas — it was keeping pace with the show’s writers. “There is a definite opportunity to push things,” he says. “But in a lot of ways, they were pushing things with the story so much, with how far they were deviating from the MCU timeline, that we really were just doing our best to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y2Cke"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDfz1v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get great audio for podcast interviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzvhheaUzOD6UXNZ8DAuFQoAqSA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807704/akrales_180215_2309_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIlUWq"&gt;Podcasts continue to be very popular, and more and more people are getting involved in them. Even if you’re not a podcast creator, at some point, you may find yourself being interviewed on or contributing to someone else’s podcast. In that case, it’s not enough to be ready to talk about your topic — you also want to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VhHII"&gt;We asked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior audio engineer Andrew Marino if he had any audio tips for people who are about to participate in a podcast. Here are his answers to our questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vwNkk4"&gt;Is it better to use my phone’s mic or use my Bluetooth headset?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AS7hH2"&gt;If this is a live show, the quality of the call is important, as there can be no editing later on, so you want to get good sound. (We’ll deal with a recorded podcast in a minute.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6e8DdQ"&gt;In most cases, your phone mic is going to be better. Obviously, this depends on the model of your phone versus that of your Bluetooth headset, but I have not come across a scenario where I preferred the sound of someone’s Bluetooth headphones. We do a lot of audio tests of wireless earbuds and headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and I can’t think of any that compare to the microphones on the average smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua0T0s"&gt;Another thing to watch out for is the battery on wireless headphones. You don’t want your headphones to die in the middle of a recording. For that reason, I always prefer headphones you can plug into your device — the sound you get from the mic is usually better, and you don’t have to worry about the battery dying or the Bluetooth connection suddenly glitching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8A5bI"&gt;Don’t use your phone on speakerphone if you can help it. If you’re using your phone to communicate, then either hold the phone up to your ear or use headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJNrao"&gt;The best thing to do if you’re not sure which microphone sounds best is to test your headphones versus your phone ahead of time by recording your voice on both and listening to the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iIaIcq"&gt;Should I record the podcast?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iVLQtq"&gt;If it’s not a live show, it is a good idea for you to record your end of the conversation for the podcast and then send the recording to your host or the podcast engineer. The audio quality on the podcast will be significantly better if it is edited together with your local recording instead of using the Zoom or phone call recording they may have on the other end. So let the person who arranges the podcast know that you are willing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SqYmxq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I usually ask guests who are being interviewed on Zoom to also record themselves separately &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="av6x1j"&gt;For example, I usually ask guests who are being interviewed on Zoom to also record themselves separately on their phones or with another device. If you don’t have a good mic, even recording yourself using your phone’s app is better than not recording at all. Many phones have a default voice recorder app (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206775"&gt;Voice Memos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://recorder.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Recorder&lt;/a&gt; on Android Pixels), but if you need to download one, I’d recommend &lt;a href="https://www.rode.com/software/reporter_app"&gt;Rode’s Reporter app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9xkOAl"&gt;If I’m using a phone to record, what’s the best way to set it up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2iunXC"&gt;A lot of producers want you to hold the phone up to your ear the same way you would on a phone call. Phones are designed to pick up voice that way, so it’s almost foolproof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k08ny5"&gt;But if you’re just using your phone to record &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; end of the conversation (rather than using it as the main way to communicate during the podcast), I recommend placing the phone about 6 to 12 inches from your face. This can mean putting the phone on top of a stack of books on your desk, on a music stand, or whatever you have laying around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWqVd5"&gt;Also, if you’re using your phone to record, it would be ideal to have your phone in airplane mode so there will be no notification sounds disrupting the recording. And be aware that phone calls coming through during a recording will usually pause the recording app on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uW2S9i"&gt;Should I buy a mic? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SUnWEh"&gt;If this is the only podcast recording you’re going to do and you don’t want to spend the money, use your phone’s microphone. That being said, I always prefer a guest to have an external microphone. Most USB microphones sound better than what you can get with your smartphone’s mic, and a lot of them are able to plug directly into your phone if you need them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oSK1qP"&gt;What kind of mic would you recommend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gf8cT6"&gt;This really depends on your budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCy8ns"&gt;What I’ve been recommending to guests lately is &lt;a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/atr2100x-usb"&gt;Audio-Technica’s ATR2100x-USB cardioid dynamic USB/XLR microphone&lt;/a&gt;. It’s affordable (it runs about $99) and very flexible; you can upgrade it with more gear or use it for other audio projects. I know a lot of people recommend the Blue Yeti, but I prefer the sound of dynamic microphones for podcast recordings rather than condenser microphones like the Yeti. They’re less sensitive to unwanted noises and have a sound that’s not all that different from professional gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hz84j5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10729872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tulvDC"&gt;An upgrade from the ATR2100x would be &lt;a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7"&gt;Shure’s MV7&lt;/a&gt;, a $249 mic that gets you a better broadcast-quality sound and some cool features like metering and the software-controllable effects that Shure has developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXpiQC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10729885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JKSUv"&gt;For both of these recommendations, you can either just plug them into your computer via USB or you can use an XLR connector to plug them into a recording interface or more professional setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1tdUk"&gt;If you really want to go pro, you can look at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shure’s SM7B&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1135365/1036?subId1=VergePodcastAudio090121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fevre27nda.html"&gt;Electro-Voice RE27N/D&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are probably used for the podcasts or radio shows you listen to. There are a lot of microphones you can try, but these two are pretty standard in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ivRF73"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10729913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNLHid"&gt;If I’m using a mic, what’s the best way to set it up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rv9EyU"&gt;If you’re at a desk, place the mic on a stand. Try not to hit your hands against the mic or the table, as that rumbling may pick up in the recording and cause a headache for the editor (or for the listener!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBy7rK"&gt;Most problems I have with recording are clipping (a distortion in the recording from overmodulating the audio signal — that crunchy sound when it gets too loud) and plosives, which are the puffs of air from consonants like “B” or “P” that overmodulate the microphone. To avoid this, I usually recommend guests to be about a fist’s length away from the microphone, and preferably have a pop filter, which is a piece of material placed in front of the microphone that catches those bursts of air from your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74InMZ"&gt;Some USB microphones will have a built-in meter to show how loud the signal is. You don’t want it to be too low (low green level) or too high (in the red). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JREPDl"&gt;If you’re using your mic to record and you’re on a Mac, the desktop version of Voice Memos is a good way to go, as long as you make sure to set your mic as the default input in your System Preferences. Another option is creating an audio recording in QuickTime or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmac%2Fgarageband%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22652143%2Fhow-to-get-great-audio-for-podcast-interviews" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GarageBand&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are free. Windows also has its own voice recorder app. If you want to download a more robust recording program, &lt;a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/"&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open-source digital audio workstation available for both Macs and PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="69TWgz"&gt;Is there anything I need to know about noise?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rrhbkr"&gt;This can be tricky. If you’re able to control the sound of your environment, do it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ZMUm"&gt;You should be in a spot where there is the least amount of noise. This may mean staying away from windows to reduce outdoor sounds, or closing the door to your room. Some noises inside your house will lower the quality of your recording as well, such as air conditioners or TVs on in the background. And you may want to temporarily turn off or unplug any home appliances that may start to hum or otherwise make noise during the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TtAF8c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Speaking &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; a closet is typically better than speaking &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;a closet &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDBPry"&gt;You should also try to dampen sound bouncing off walls and into your microphone. A lot of people try to record podcasts in their closets. This can definitely provide a lot of isolation from noise, but it may end up sounding too boxy and stuffy, with your voice bouncing back and forth against the short distance between the walls. Speaking &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; a closet is typically better than speaking &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;a closet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABdNmu"&gt;I’ve also seen people build pillow and blanket forts on their desks or record in their cars. Though it’s not always an ideal sound (I really hate that boxy sound of close quarters recording!), it may be better than your microphone picking up sirens, big trucks, or loud music outside your apartment window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qbSuo0"&gt;Is there anything else I need to know in order to prepare?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CKVuUy"&gt;If you’ve recorded your part of the interview and want to share it with the podcast creators, file size can be an issue. If the file is too big, you may not be able to send it over email easily. Most of the time, I send our guests a link to a Google Drive folder where they can drop the audio file. If that doesn’t work for you (for example, if you don’t have enough room left in your Google account), you can try a free service that handles large files, such as &lt;a href="https://wetransfer.com/"&gt;WeTransfer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fashion follows function: what’s next for the phone industry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egc6EhRtvEHgq_sa2mXeZSySdt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807645/vpavic_210831_4739_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsdFVb"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a totally normal phone with One Weird Trick: it folds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Dan Seifert explained in our full review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the beginning of a new phase for foldables, one where buying a folding phone is something that could appeal to anybody, not just techies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wHfV"&gt;Samsung is promoting the phone in the ways Samsung usually does, touting features and spec improvements. But it’s also doing another thing: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;promoting the phone as something stylish&lt;/a&gt;. A full-on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLP5SLsUY0"&gt;music video ad with BTS&lt;/a&gt; joins online vertical video ads that are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r75GjfTy2_w"&gt;as focused on the clothing and pockets the phone fits&lt;/a&gt; in as the phone itself. In essence, it’s the latest in a long time of tech companies trying to make the case that their phones are fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MJ77E"&gt;That’s nothing new, but it’s still notable because with the Z Flip 3, it’s so &lt;em&gt;explicit.&lt;/em&gt; Sure, there’s a spec argument about how its improved pocketability is a good reason to buy the Flip, but really that’s not its central appeal. The Z Flip is interesting because it’s different and because it looks better than your average phone. And maybe, if Samsung is very lucky, the fact that it’s a flip phone could connect it to the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/y2k-style-celebrity-runway-trend"&gt;Y2K fashion trend happening right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3urvw"&gt;The smartphone industry operates a lot like the fashion industry. Both have seasonal lineups (often in the spring and fall), both have a wide range of prices for products that do essentially the same thing, both encourage you to put a premium on a brand label, both have big communities of people who obsessively follow every trend &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even larger group of people who couldn’t care much less, and, of course, both have entire industries of influencers and journalists whose job it is to track the changes in those industries. (Hi, welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypeSPQ6QAiO7qCV5whpg1OnlXvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818674/vpavic_210831_4739_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 in Samsung’s stylish new case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mYbTSA"&gt;There are plenty of other parallels to draw, but the key difference between fashion and phones is that phones have been sold on the basis of their technological progress. This year’s phone performs &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or is faster or has some new thing it’s capable of that last year’s phone can’t do. And though there are obviously technical enhancements to clothing, usually the main reason to buy the new stuff is to stay on trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gOszr"&gt;With fashion, the impetus is to participate in what’s new and what’s &lt;em&gt;now. &lt;/em&gt;Phones have usually been about participating in &lt;em&gt;the future&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEc15H"&gt;And though I don’t think the march of technological progress in phones is going to grind to a halt, I do think that we’ve reached a point where the differences between a cheap phone and an expensive phone aren’t about basic functionality anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk7PBO"&gt;Expensive phones are about quality and brand — sure, the camera works better, but you’re also getting a nicer screen, better materials, and whatever cachet comes with that phone’s brand. Sounds a lot like fashion, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWaSiQ"&gt;Apple has, of course, been pushing its phones as fashionable objects (or at least as stylish ones) for some time. It has the stronger brand and cultural cachet — both of which matter in fashion! But Apple’s influence and the overall technological trends have led most phones to look basically the same: big flat glass on the front and back, metal rails, camera bump. The only places for expression are the shapes of the rails and the color of the glass. Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTI5YF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the feature differences between cheap and expensive phones get smaller, brand and style will become more important differentiators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82ET1o"&gt;Is the Z Flip 3 more stylish than other phones? That’s something I’ll leave you to decide. At minimum, it’s a phone that breaks out of the boring flat-glass-slab sameness of every other smartphone out there. That is meaningful, and it (pardon the pun) communicates something about you to the people who see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQp9Xo"&gt;The Z Flip 3 also has many other cultural connotations. It’s a green bubble, it’s a Samsung, it’s a techy thing, it’s not common. All of these are reasons to like (or dislike) this phone, and few have anything to do with the refresh rate of its inner display (which is great, btw). The tech of the Z Flip 3 is actually boring, if I’m honest, but the phone itself is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xkVQx"&gt;What would it mean for the next iPhone or next Galaxy phone to not have any technical improvements &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; but simply look different? We already know that form factor changes drive huge sales numbers for Apple. We’ve already seen the same basic dynamic happen with the various iPods Apple cycled through year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaSEFQ"&gt;One more thing: like clothing, phones participate in our perception of &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. In some cases, that can arise from the physical thing itself — but more often, it’s how you choose to use it: what apps you keep on your home screen, how often you use them, whether you let yourself get sucked in for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93oDi6"&gt;That’s one reason that cases are such a big and important business. It’s not just about protecting the phone; it’s about expression. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/14/17441686/verizon-at-t-phone-case-designer-selection-next-gen-store"&gt;Ashley Carman has written about just how big the case business is&lt;/a&gt; and how closely big carriers are following fashion trends to make cases that people will want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SgtKea"&gt;[Helena Elicerio has] been the company’s phone case product manager for the past two years. She previously worked in fashion as a buyer-merchandiser for companies like Gap and Delia’s, where she did essentially the same job she does now — evaluating products, trend spotting, and designing — except with clothing.&lt;br&gt;“When I was in fashion, one of the things people used to always make fun of me for was that I always changed my phone cases,” she says. “I don’t think anybody tied [cases] immediately back to a fashion accessory. I have an iPhone, but it looks exactly like everyone else’s, so this is how I can show my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2OhzUN"&gt;This whole analysis may seem overwrought, but I think a better way to put it is under-analyzed. I’ve long believed that we do not take gadgets as seriously as we should as cultural objects. It’s tempting to say “It’s just a phone,” but I believe that’s the equivalent of saying “It’s just a jacket” or “It’s just a dress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4YhFwi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of thinking strictly about “design” with phones, it’s time to start thinking about fashion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncxCQC"&gt;Part of the importance of clothing is what it communicates to others. But the more important part is how it makes us feel. Confident, comfortable, bold, fit, stylish, or simple: clothing is about more than simply covering our bodies. And after clothing, what other physical object is on your person every day? Why shouldn’t its features include those feelings in addition to its megapixel count? I would argue that it does but that we’re doing a bad job of talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2mR4B"&gt;I believe that when it comes to phones, we’ve been too set in a design mindset instead of a fashion mindset. We’ve accepted the idea that form must follow function but that truism doesn’t apply to clothing, not really. And as the functionality of phones ceases to be a significant differentiator, something else will take its place. If we don’t understand what that new differentiator is, why it matters, and how it operates, we’re setting ourselves up to be snowed by the companies that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu7eFr"&gt;Tech operates in our culture like fashion does. And when you get right down to it: clothing is also technology, just very, very old technology. The way we see ourselves is mediated — and has always been mediated — by technology. Phones are fashion and fashion is culture, and all of that is way more complicated than it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTpPIn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PxFTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia Broadcast now works with more cameras and uses less VRAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLlIgVb9NdLOZuHncbDwADfT1Ng=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807652/NVIDIA_Broacast_v_1.3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYR7n0"&gt;Nvidia is updating its Broadcast app to improve noise removal, support more cameras, and reduce the amount of VRAM used by the app. Nvidia Broadcast is primarily used by streamers and content creators to filter out background noise from a microphone, or blur a backdrop for a webcam. Nvidia is focusing on improving these main use cases with version 1.3 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KzgRa"&gt;While Nvidia Broadcast has become a popular choice for streamers, the app would sometimes filter out high-pitched voices when someone was speaking excitedly. “The new update addresses this with dedicated training sound profiles to retain that speech while removing the unwanted background noise,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fsept-2021-nvidia-broadcast-update%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F2%2F22653658%2Fnvidia-broadcast-version-1-3-update-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. That should mean any screaming or shock moments on stream will no longer be inadvertently removed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZugvF5cUQ-3-aYpQrgYUz8frp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822164/broadcast_audio_630x354_dt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Broadcast app filters out background noise and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psu4AW"&gt;Nvidia is also updating Broadcast to support a range of camera apps, including Canon EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon Webcam Utility, Sony Webcam Utility, and OBS Virtual Camera. This will make it a lot easier for streamers and broadcasters to tweak their camera image, while also adding a background blur or other effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzrIbP"&gt;Nvidia’s last 1.2 update to Broadcast added stacking for effects, but if you used a number of them across a microphone, speakers, and camera at the same time then performance and frame rates during gaming took a hit. This latest 1.3 update dramatically reduces VRAM usage by more than 40 percent, which will greatly improve performance while gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k7xi4"&gt;We’ve run into a number of bugs and issues with Nvidia Broadcast in the past, but Nvidia says it has several new UI elements and bug fixes “that round out a better, smoother, Nvidia Broadcast experience.” You can download Nvidia’s latest 1.3 Broadcast update &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fbroadcasting%2Fbroadcast-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F2%2F22653658%2Fnvidia-broadcast-version-1-3-update-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over at the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces PlayStation showcase, promises ‘sneak peek at the future of PS5’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWrZi_o3RGbnB0w4DlkQC0Nivl0=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807597/1920x1080_BLOG_LEAD_IMAGE_SOCIAL_POSTS.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRYLN3"&gt;Sony is announcing that it will hold a special PlayStation showcase on September 9th. The event will start at 10AM ET / 1PM PT, and will run for 40 minutes in what is being teased as “a look into the future of PS5.” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"&gt;Sony says&lt;/a&gt; its showcase will include updates from its PlayStation Studios, and a look at games releasing this holiday and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9XvQz"&gt;Sony could be ready to launch a new PS5 system software update that it has been beta testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;The update unlocks M.2 SSD support&lt;/a&gt;, and also includes some UI improvements to the PS5 dashboard and 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C2QVMj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get a sneak peek at the future of PS5, with updates from PlayStation Studios and industry-leading devs. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1433407411872747521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Es7NJN"&gt;While there’s a promise of what’s next for PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;Sony’s new PlayStation VR headset&lt;/a&gt; won’t make an appearance at the showcase. The next-gen PSVR was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"&gt;detailed at a developer summit recently&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that the headset connects to a PS5 via a single cable. The headset also includes higher-resolution OLED displays (2000 x 2040 pixels per eye)and an improved 110-degree field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQJ3Ql"&gt;Sony is still promising “plenty of great PS5 games from developers large and small,” and it’s likely we’ll get another look at &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn, &lt;/em&gt;that was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;delayed to February 18th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps we’ll also see some updates on the next-gen patch for GTA V, and some final gameplay of Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;PS5 exclusive that launches later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5g2o4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering Sony’s PlayStation Showcase, so stay tuned for all the latest PS5 news.&lt;/p&gt;
