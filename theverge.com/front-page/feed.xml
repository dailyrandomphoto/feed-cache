    <title>Instagram is getting rid of IGTV, sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikGjvnlzHqgKzQt23gnO4PYzVso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954505/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKSX8b"&gt;Instagram is finally acknowledging that IGTV, its first big push into video, didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58ivKh"&gt;Today, the company is rebranding IGTV as “Instagram TV,” and it’s getting rid of the exclusive IGTV video format. Videos posted to the main Instagram feed can now run up to 60 minutes long — a length previously reserved for IGTV videos — and you’ll no longer have to leave the main app to view them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUy9lK"&gt;A spokesperson for Instagram says the IGTV app, now called the Instagram TV app, will remain as a “destination for people to visit with the intent of watching video.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgHQaud6HLT7XcEvWAhYou5fSlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902533/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Feed videos and IGTV videos will be consolidated into Instagram TV, which will get a single tab on profile pages. Reels will remain discrete.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQcpkI"&gt;IGTV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484436/instagram-igtv-video-app-launch"&gt;introduced in June 2018&lt;/a&gt; and was essentially meant to become a mobile equivalent to YouTube, creating a space to discover and watch longer videos. But the longer format never caught on. And just two months later, an app called TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcap6T"&gt;Instagram has since refocused its video efforts on rivaling TikTok with its short video format Reels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and Instagram has aggressively pushed forward with them, giving them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;a central spot in the app’s navigation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;starting to sell ads&lt;/a&gt;, and cross-posting them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;into Facebook’s News Feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvXr66"&gt;Reels still has one major shortcoming, though: it doesn’t offer a consistent way for creators to get paid out, as YouTube and TikTok do. Facebook plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022. Some of that money has gone to Reels creators, but it’s not a dedicated system for videomakers to get paid — always a good way to encourage people to make things on your app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rCRZyVU_HTDIuU5P5hl6VNkYGxE=/142x0:1299x771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954097/Screen_Shot_2018_06_05_at_2.36.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dx59nZ"&gt;The final new fighter coming to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;was revealed as Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the event, hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, culminated in some arguably bigger news. The three mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; games are coming to the Nintendo Switch. This includes &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQ7H2"&gt;Notably, all three titles will be delivered via cloud streaming instead of native ports, so they won’t be stored locally on your Switch. Nintendo showed the games running on PlayStation 4 during the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s96Y2Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-q6Gz_4Yqc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3839&amp;amp;start=3839" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1mg2J"&gt;Prices and release dates for each of the games weren’t detailed during the stream, but Sakurai stated that the release date will be announced later. It’s hard to say how &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will look and feel while streamed over the internet instead of played locally. Other games, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, also have cloud versions on the Switch, and the experience wasn’t as bad as I feared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzUrVa"&gt;If this &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; release gets similar treatment, Nintendo will likely offer a free trial period for the games to make sure that your internet connection can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox web store integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming and wish lists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXNGIOSclbKBRQEBeWlQ3jSrHWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954095/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2q3rFZ"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out a new Xbox web store that integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud), wish lists, and more. The new Xbox web store includes buttons to add games to wish lists, quick access to redeem codes, and full Xbox Cloud Gaming integration. If you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can simply click play on a supported game, and it will instantly stream from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KLNpl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tamelucas/status/1445184671864741890"&gt;Twitter user tamelucas&lt;/a&gt; first spotted the new Xbox web store yesterday, and it only appears to be live in Canada. It’s very different from the usual Microsoft Store listing and has a design that’s similar to the rest of the Xbox UI. You can also use the web store to quickly install games to an Xbox console you own or buy the game as a gift for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5PQ7tXUUE22t8OKKZb1pD4PMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902451/UFX1HGF.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox web store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBLbek"&gt;If you’re interested in trying the new Xbox web store, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FHalo-Wars%3A-Definitive-Edition%2FBPRPQSKXTD1L%2F0001%2F9V55MMP1XDBZ&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710708%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out this listing for &lt;em&gt;Halo Wars: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft hasn’t officially announced this new Xbox web store, but given it’s already appearing in Canada, we’d expect to see it roll out generally to other regions very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destiny 2 arrives on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D_ZPOWB_qgY71UlVqmKuF4M3yLI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953872/bungie_net_metadata_beyondlight_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gsclnz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is finally arriving on Xbox Game Pass for PC later this month. While the looter shooter has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335483/destiny-2-xbox-game-pass-release-date-microsoft-bungie"&gt;available on the Xbox console side of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year, PC players have been patiently waiting for it to be included on Xbox Game Pass for PC. Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/05/xbox-game-pass-update-october-2021/"&gt;now bundling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2OtR0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Bungie made some clear optimizations for the console version of the game on Xbox Series X last year, with support for 4K resolution at 60fps on both the Xbox Series X and PS5. The PC version launching on Xbox Game Pass for PC won’t be any different from what’s already available on Steam, but it will mean cross-play players will see a new Windows logo next to Xbox Game Pass for PC players, instead of the familiar Steam one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q38goH"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will include the &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; DLC with its stasis-freezing abilities, Bungie has already made it clear that &lt;em&gt;Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s next big expansion, won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639582/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-release-date-gjallarhorn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will continue the story of the sci-fi space series and see players finally face off against Savathûn, the Witch Queen. &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen &lt;/em&gt;launches on February 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lost Judgment is a better sequel with a messy story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Hr1YPmnxhg0Fg2EWVtkTM9sF2E=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953729/LJ12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ii3K4Y"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series is beloved for its uncanny ability to bounce between absurd humor, deep pathos, and brutal violence and making it seem like the most natural thing in the world. Lost Judgment, the sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744110/judgment-game-review-ps4-yakuza"&gt;2019’s detective-focused spinoff &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marks a rare misstep in that regard. In many ways it’s much improved on its predecessor and spins a more ambitious story — but it can’t quite deliver on its themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTrvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; picks up after the first game with Takayuki Yagami — played in droll, deadpan fashion by Japanese megastar Takuya Kimura — returning to his work as a private detective. Yagami is hired to investigate an incident of bullying at a high school in Yokohama, but soon enough the case becomes entwined with a groping conviction in Tokyo and a murder nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5OH3c"&gt;The plot is more than a little far-fetched, as is the case with most Japanese crime procedurals, and the inevitable shoehorning in of gang warfare feels like the writers were overly beholden to the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. But it’s told at a briskly entertaining pace and feels more focused than the previous game’s spiraling Big Pharma conspiracy. I generally appreciated the effort to tell a more intimate, smaller-scale story, even though it doesn’t ultimately pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="lost judgment" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-zjL_dBmSgBGjCO1PRzyHWVCks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899878/LJCombat13.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nldAL4"&gt;The detective elements of the game are much improved. You’ll still have to tail enemies through the streets and go through some pointless on-rails stealth sections, but they mostly serve as palate cleansers rather than points of frustration. With its streamlined talking-heads cutscenes and emphasis on presenting meaningful evidence, &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; sometimes feels more like &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; than its predecessor, which was essentially &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; with an occasional gumshoe mini-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Li3QPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The story deals with some of the darkest subject matter yet seen in the series&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P887sr"&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment &lt;/em&gt;will be worth playing for anyone turned off by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;the series’ shift to turn-based RPG-style combat with &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The brawling is as smooth and satisfying as it’s ever been, with three distinct combat styles that all have clear uses. It helps that &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; is by far the best-looking &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent game to date, with a dramatic lighting system, realistic characters, and solid 60fps performance (at least on the PS5 I used for testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVbTgG"&gt;Kamurocho has never looked so good, and this time Yagami gets to play in Yokohama, too, with the much larger Ijincho district returning from &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike most recent &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games, the original &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; only took place in Kamurocho and felt quite cramped as a result; the sequel gives you far more to explore. As ever, Sega’s &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; team does a great job at reusing locations and packing them full of new detail. You’re now able to skateboard on streets to get around faster, for example, and in Yokohama you can take a cute shiba inu for walks and discover side quests in return. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="lost judgment" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vSJPXKqutgUjYWX2RhCJfG8Vvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899879/LJInvestigative03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="io5ULL"&gt;The breezy vibe is offset by the main storyline, which deals with some of the darkest subject matter yet seen in the series. The plot centers around high school bullying and suicide, which is certainly a topical and contentious issue in Japan; just last week a case involving a sixth-grade girl who died by suicide made news as the school denied that bullying was the cause. But&lt;em&gt; Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; takes a flippant approach to the problem, with Yagami resorting to preposterous methods like placing remote speakers under classroom tables to vocally stand up for bullied kids when their classmates won’t. Other characters, meanwhile, get killed off or make jarring heel turns in endless twists that don’t feel earned by the plot, and the game often makes ham-fisted attempts to get you to sympathize with some pretty clearly terrible people. It’s good that Sega tried to highlight the central issue, and I don’t think anyone expects a video game to solve it altogether, but it doesn’t feel like a good match for &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt;’s otherwise schlocky tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upusLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t ignore the big leaps this game makes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="URwt8c"&gt;You can look at &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; in two ways: an often clumsy attempt at serious storytelling, or a technically accomplished sequel that much improves on its predecessor. It’s both, really. The plot doesn’t fully land, and I found there to be more awkward moments than in &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; or other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games. But I also can’t ignore the big leaps this game makes in other areas, and it still keeps up the irreverent charm of the series for much of its running time. Overall, I think this is a much better game than &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; and I would like to see where it goes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeY7t5"&gt;The future of the &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; series is unclear, however. Various rumors suggest that &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; creator and executive director Toshihiro Nagoshi may be leaving Sega, while Kimura’s notoriously protective talent agency Johnny’s is reportedly refusing to allow future games with his likeness due to a dispute over a PC version. I’m hoping none of this stops Sega from working on the next installment, though — while &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; would be an unfortunately messy ending, I could see it as the ambitious middle part of a trilogy that finds its feet in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrScbC"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lost Judgment &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S / X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Congress will hear new concerns about child safety on the world’s largest social network&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mXO6As"&gt;On Tuesday, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is appearing before a Senate Commerce subcommittee in what promises to be one of Facebook’s toughest congressional hearings in years. After serving as a source for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;bombshell reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;went public on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; with concerns about Instagram’s mental health impacts on its youngest users, drawn from internal Facebook reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5iWnc"&gt;The result has been a new focus on child safety — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;a particularly sore point for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The company has disputed claims that Instagram exacerbates body issues in teenage girls, but the broader concerns about algorithmic amplification of harmful content have been harder to dismiss. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;In a hearing last week&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) shared the results of a test in which his own staff was bombarded with Instagram posts related to eating disorders and self-harm after creating a dummy account posing as a teenage girl. Today’s hearing is expected to focus on the same topics, with direct testimony from Haugen on the company’s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFIO34"&gt;We’ll be updating this post with everything that happens during the hearing — every question from lawmakers, every important quote, and every piece of new information from Haugen. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DKVAUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRu93KLU868?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VJmWF7"&gt;
&lt;p id="mpFIZk"&gt;In his opening remarks, &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)&lt;/strong&gt; described how Facebook “has put profits ahead of people.” He noted how the platform’s algorithmic feeds can amplify insecurities in its younger users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtDYUK"&gt;“I hope we will discuss whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm,” Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLjwiF"&gt;Blumenthal also called on &lt;strong&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; to return to Congress to testify on behalf of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s &lt;/em&gt;recent revelations on child safety. Facebook has vigorously contested many of Haugen’s claims, but has done so through surrogates like global head of safety Antigone Davis or public relations lead Nick Clegg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkTpD"&gt;“Rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing,” Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QZrEB7"&gt;
&lt;p id="l06NNc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)&lt;/strong&gt; tackled Facebook’s business model in her first remarks during the hearing. “Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids’ safety on their platforms, at least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on posts or decreasing their ad revenues,” she said. “Follow the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5Xo2"&gt;Following up on last week’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;finsta” discussion&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn says that Facebook turns a blind eye to these private accounts as a means of boosting its active user numbers. Children can use these private accounts to interact with other people and the platform without their parents’ approval, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0GURQZ"&gt;
&lt;p id="fjXrT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/strong&gt; said Facebook has “repeatedly” misled the public about “what its own research reveals about the safety of children and the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems as a role in spreading divisive and extreme messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBeyZ"&gt;Haugen also called on Congress to take regulatory action to change Facebook’s business incentives to amplify harmful content to its users. She also encouraged lawmakers to push for further transparency into the company to tackle its “closed design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAUnt9"&gt;“It is unaccountable until the incentives change,” Haugen said. “Facebook will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNyLJ0"&gt;But she also showed optimism that the problem can be solved if the government intervenes. “These problems are solvable. A safer, free-speech-respecting social media is possible,” Haugen said. “Facebook can change, but it’s clearly not going to do so on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n4Bvpg"&gt;
&lt;p id="IQMs7P"&gt;Outside of Facebook’s business model, &lt;strong&gt;Haugen identified several structural issues&lt;/strong&gt; that make it more difficult for the company to react to scandals. “Facebook is stuck in a cycle where it struggles to hire. That causes it to understaff projects, which causes scandals, which then makes it harder to hire,” Haugen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0hoLX4"&gt;“A pattern of behavior I saw at Facebook was that, often problems were so understaffed that there was an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems. So for example, I worked on the counterespionage team, and at any given time, our team could only handle a third of the cases we knew about. We knew that if we built even a basic detector, we would likely have even more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VWvGPu"&gt;Haugen also pointed out how Facebook’s engagement numbers are often the deciding factor in developing its services. “Mark has built an organization that is very metrics-driven. It is intended to be flat. There is no unilateral responsibility,” she said. “The metrics make the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="BabbZ1"&gt;
&lt;p id="xhF3lD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In her &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interview Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Haugen described how Facebook’s Civic Integrity group dissolved after the 2020 presidential election. Those processes were later reinstated as an emergency decision during the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)&lt;/strong&gt; asked Haugen why Facebook decided to disband the integrity group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OH7Tyn"&gt;“Facebook has been emphasizing a false choice,” Haugen told Klobuchar. “They’ve said the safeguards that were in place before the election implicated free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kBjf5a"&gt;
&lt;p id="1BS4mI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. John Thune (R-SD)&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation"&gt;previously introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. On Tuesday, Thune asked Haugen whether a change to that law could encourage Facebook to change its algorithms in a way that decreases user harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtNmgS"&gt;“I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed Section 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement-based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content. It is pulling families apart, and in places like Ethiopia, it is literally fanning ethnic violence,” Haugen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="35SEnl"&gt;
&lt;p id="rl6K0b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In discussion with Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS)&lt;/strong&gt;, Haugen came out in support of Section 230 reform that relates to algorithms even though these reforms can be “very complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Matabe"&gt;“Companies have 100 percent control over their algorithms, and Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth and virality and reactiveness over public safety,” Haugen said. “They’re paying for their profits right now with our safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tOTGlM"&gt;
&lt;p id="LqNG8z"&gt;One of the big themes of the hearing has been that committee members want to respond to this by passing actual legislation — something that didn’t happen after the Cambridge Analytica hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBdLsC"&gt;After his questions with Haugen, &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)&lt;/strong&gt; put that sentiment in stark confrontational terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CdkJ9N"&gt;Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action. You can work with us or not work with us, but we will not allow your company to harm our children and our families and our democracies any longer. Thank you, Ms. Haugen. We will act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="D7RKCZ"&gt;

    <title>Sora is the final Smash Ultimate character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzOqy88uqJESqWOU0tR-ayauLGU=/92x0:1004x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953534/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_10.06.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OKqFdk"&gt;The newest &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; fighter has been announced, and it is not Waluigi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC7v4Y"&gt;Nintendo, during a livestream event, announced Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will join the roster as the 82nd playable character (if we’re not counting the echo fighters). Check out the trailer below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="scuZnD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqhp4M1lMTw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fiacu"&gt;Sora joins the esteemed company of characters from across celebrated Nintendo titles and beyond, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534874/super-smash-bros-ultimate-kayuza-tekken-dlc-character-fighters-pass-2-e3-2021"&gt;Jin Kazuya&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt; Sephiroth&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17655942/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-castlevania-simon-belmont"&gt; a couple of Belmonts&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21065278/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-dlc-character-byleth-fire-emblem"&gt; entirely too many Fire Emblem characters&lt;/a&gt;. In advance of the &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; livestream, the internet was alight with speculation as to who the newest character would be. Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was an early favorite as was &lt;em&gt;Dragonball Z’s &lt;/em&gt;Goku. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W92rff"&gt;Waluigi, however, was one of the most popular guesses as fans have been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/06/12/waluigi-was-robbed-and-humiliated-by-nintendo-and-his-fans-are-furious/"&gt;clamoring for his addition&lt;/a&gt; for years. As there will be no more characters added to &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt;, that dream now dies and with it the hopes of his many fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E12q3m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;Masahiro Sakurai&lt;/a&gt; has said this character &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22553841/super-smash-bros-ultimate-kazuya-release-date-tekken"&gt;will be the last fighter added&lt;/a&gt; to the game. In a tweet, the celebrated Nintendo personality also revealed this will be his last fighter presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52peaw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good morning.&lt;br&gt;The last DLC fighter for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will be announced shortly.&lt;br&gt;This will also be my final fighter presentation.&lt;br&gt;It'll be sad to say farewell, but I hope you all enjoy it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gV1B8fgtd6"&gt;https://t.co/gV1B8fgtd6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1445382876086902790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zycu0G"&gt;Sakurai frequently joked during presentations that working on &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; has been tiring and wondered if he’d ever &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccgHnBQ0YM&amp;amp;t=1906s"&gt;get a break&lt;/a&gt;. With Sora as the last &lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; character, Mr. Sakurai can, at last, get some &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/please-for-the-love-of-god-let-masahiro-sakurai-rest-1845241032"&gt;well-deserved rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will these top Steam games support Steam Deck? We ask their developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ig2Syrva7PjGa4-kJJqpG7spCK8=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953418/steam_deck.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5YP9VQ"&gt;Valve’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;$400 Steam Deck gaming handheld&lt;/a&gt; runs Linux, but it can play Windows games too. Many of them, anyhow! Some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that doesn’t play nice with &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;the Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt; which lets Windows games work. That’s changing this year, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;both Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; confirming to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that support is on the way, and Epic says it takes “just a few clicks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6tiI3"&gt;But will game developers patch their games to take advantage? Not necessarily! We reached out to every developer of every top EAC and BattlEye game on Steam. While four of them gave us a definite yes, the rest were less committed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxLTdw"&gt;Here’s what they all had to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FsYmJH"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;7 Days to Die&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="24vKam"&gt;“We have no comment on it at this time. Our game is still in development. As we are still in Alpha, we are not ready to give a definitive yes or no at this time,” a spokesperson for developer The Fun Pimps tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sMkd7Y"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2yC3Dk"&gt;“We’re checking with the Respawn team on this and will get back to you as soon as we have an update,” a rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nQA54a"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ark: Survival Evolved&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CZztMr"&gt;“Yes, we plan to update ARK settings to enable Battleye’s anti-cheat tweak for Steam Deck,” a Studio Wildcard rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W5cOel"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Desert&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VMR55I"&gt;“I’m checking with our devs right now and will get back to you with an answer asap,” a Pearl Abyss rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rr8tEx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;DayZ&lt;/em&gt; — Maybe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rYBtGd"&gt;“At this stage it’s a ‘maybe’ for us – we are still evaluating Proton as a whole and cannot yet commit to anything,” a Bohemia Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrdEIb"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dead by Daylight &lt;/em&gt;— Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GlnkzH"&gt;“I can confirm that we have plans of updating our EAC to support the Steamdeck in the future,” a Behaviour Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b2aVjT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AnhvTI"&gt;“We’ve been trying to run this down. We don’t have anything to share right now, today, but we’ll keep at it,” a Bungie rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p0NUZv"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uypZxD"&gt;Even though it’s owned by Epic Games, the company saying EAC support should take “just a few clicks,” Mediatonic would not commit to an update for &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AX1C6"&gt;“Thanks for reaching out but at this time we won’t be making a comment,” a Mediatonic rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jNGoyZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i9zNhH"&gt;“I won’t have anything to share here, I’m afraid,” a rep for Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TrLWit"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; — No reply whatsoever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wciYkG"&gt;Crytek didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s8Ck0U"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Paladins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smite&lt;/em&gt; — Maybe, but not this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jRnoR8"&gt;“We don’t currently have a timeline available but hope to provide such support in the near future,” a Hi-Rez Studios rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NhbGgd"&gt;While we have been actively doing some research on the topic, it is unlikely this support would happen by the Steamdeck launch in December. Even though our games do share some similarities, each one of them requires its own implementation that is significantly more delicate than changing some settings in the SDK. Hi-Rez is proud to have its games available on multiple platforms and consoles, so we hope to be able to provide such support in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="64yre1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HBEUje"&gt;“The team does not have a comment for this,” a rep for Krafton tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jOGwGO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Siege &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N2bOky"&gt;“We don’t have anything to share at this time,” a Ubisoft rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qWKf3u"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zttq2h"&gt;“Yeah we’re working on it. Hoping to be done by the time the Deck comes out, if not it’ll be really soon after,” Facepunch Studios founder Garry Newman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qxevgr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;War Thunder&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4YOIKk"&gt;“Yes, we’re planning to do everything we can to make sure that War Thunder works on Steam Deck,” Gaijin Entertainment co-founder Anton Yudinsev tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUKY0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll update this story as more top games offer a yes or no on support for anti-cheat on Linux/Proton generally, and the Steam Deck specifically. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s ‘Fortnitemares’ Halloween event will include a spooky short film festival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSzQ6v9T3JuXPThy0aTTVRbXXaM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953414/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhiP7B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is hosting its third short film festival as part of its annual “Fortnitemares” Halloween event, but with a seasonal twist: the latest Short Nite show will focus on &lt;em&gt;spooky&lt;/em&gt; animated short films, dubbed “Shortnitemares,” because there’s nothing people love more than a good portmanteau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOgGvb"&gt;Shortnitemares follows up on the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585705/fortnite-short-nite-2-film-festival-party-royale-july-23rd"&gt;two Short Nite film festivals&lt;/a&gt; (held over the summer and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22278892/fortnite-film-festival-short-nite-party-royale"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;), although the latest iteration is getting a bit of an upgrade: instead of airing in a nonstop loop on the combat-free Party Royale island, Shortnitemares will get a custom-made movie theater from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/quantumbuilds?lang=en"&gt;Quantum Builds&lt;/a&gt; (which specializes in creating custom &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; maps for brand activations) that will offer individual theaters for each short to watch on-demand, in addition to a main room that will show the entire lineup on loop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvyK6X9qBvnuncH5lJAudtuiZq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902279/18BR_FNMRS_Pumpkin_Outfits.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nVhhVM"&gt;Epic hasn’t announced which films or creators will be featured in Shortnitemares (or even a specific date for the event outside of sometime at the end of October), but it promises that it’ll have more news soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgOjLF"&gt;Epic is also emphasizing the Halloween event much more than usual this year, with new content in the game every day of the month of October. This includes Halloween-themed maps and modes that members of the community created and a slew of classic monster movie costumes like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mummy&lt;/em&gt; to purchase in the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="la5zkt"&gt;The event will also tie into the storyline of the ongoing season, which already veered toward the spookier side of things with the invasion of the mysterious cubes and a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;-esque “Sideways” dimension. Fortnitemares will launch a new weapon, additional quests, and a limited-time game mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdfBuy"&gt;There’s also whatever this skin is, which appears to allow players to dress up as the sinister cubes and use a chunk of the island itself as a weapon: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Google Nest’s latest security cameras are now on sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUIT3MoRk5DPayL078ZisjLJaug=/0x423:5225x3906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953138/Nest_Cam_with_floodlight_US_Keyword_Blog.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest’s first floodlight security camera is available to buy today.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzmOg0"&gt;Following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news"&gt;announcement of an all-new Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; lineup this summer, Google has made the last of the four cameras it announced available in its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_floodlight_wired?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;: the Google Nest Cam wired ($99.99) and the Google Nest Cam with floodlight ($279.99). The cameras join the new Nest Cam battery, an indoor / outdoor camera, and the Nest Doorbell battery that went on sale in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFwBAm"&gt;The Nest Cam wired is the budget camera in the lineup and is much smaller than the indoor / outdoor Nest Cam, which can be wired or work off its built-in battery. The indoor model dispenses with a built-in battery and isn’t weatherproofed, helping make it cheaper and smaller. It keeps the same 16:9 aspect ratio, with 1080p video at up to 30fps, plus it has a 135-degree field of view and 6x digital zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EUyxR"&gt;One unique feature about the Nest Cam wired is that it comes in four colors — white, pink, beige, or green — a first in the smart home security camera space. There’s also a wooden base available for the pink (sorry, “sand”) version of the camera for a further aesthetic flourish and a price hike to $119.99. Interestingly, Google is keeping the original black &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;indoor Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; around for $129.99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mq7UyA5umlBA7xVx1zbTALJp__k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902056/NestCam_wired__Colors_Snow_SandMaple_Linen_Fog_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google Nest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam wired comes in four color choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wGMNCr"&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is essentially the indoor / outdoor Nest Cam attached to a 2,400 lumen floodlight. It streams 1080p video with HDR, with a 1/2.8-inch, 2-megapixel sensor, 130-degree diagonal field of view, and a 6x digital zoom. It requires permanent power and has to be wired into your home’s wiring through a standard outdoor junction box. The floodlight is rated IP65 for weatherproofing and the camera itself is IP54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyNsn9"&gt;The key feature here is that the floodlight cam uses on-device intelligence to detect people, animals, and vehicles rather than just relying on a motion sensor, as most floodlight cams do. This should mean you’re not constantly illuminating the garden when tree branches blow in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSAtbhJ_SNsrdCft5MG4TXCi_j0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902059/Nest_Cam_with_Floodlight_night_far_front_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google Nest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is Google’s first hardware foray into any kind of smart lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HqHa6i"&gt;All the new Nest cameras use built-in intelligence and on-device processing, which means less reliance on the cloud — so no fees for animal, vehicle, and person detection. You can also create Activity Zones for free and get three hours of event-based video without a subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjXaL0"&gt;Local storage on the cameras will record up to an hour of footage (about a week’s worth of events) if the power or internet go out. For more than three hours of video clips, or to enable 24/7 recording on the Nest Cam wired and Nest Cam with floodlight, you need to pay for a Nest Aware subscription, starting at $6 a month. This also enables Nest’s Familiar Faces feature that will tell you which person it’s seen as opposed to just that it’s seen a person. The Nest Cams use the Google Home app and do not work with the Nest app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0HbHI"&gt;However, this isn’t the last we’ll see of new Nest Cams. Google recently announced that it’s planning to release a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022"&gt;new Nest Cam Doorbell wired&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, presumably to replace the excellent but aging Nest Hello video doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7nGNw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8lmyL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9:52AM ET, October 5th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details of the weatherproofing ratings for the Nest Cam with floodlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
