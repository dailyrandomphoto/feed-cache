    <title>Borderlands 3 is getting crossplay support, but not on PlayStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw-M6B88qe7AXCUX1qCNg0M-l1M=/4x0:1324x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350110/borderlands3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEzQzJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; is set to get crossplay support soon, but not on Sony’s PlayStation consoles. Gearbox, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;, has revealed it was ready to enable “full crossplay support across all platforms” but that the publisher, 2K Games, required it be removed for PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPj5VE"&gt;Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford revealed the details in a Twitter post today, noting “we have been required by the publisher to remove crossplay support for PlayStation consoles” to pass certification. It’s not immediately clear why 2K Games has asked Gearbox to remove PlayStation crossplay or whether it’s related to Sony’s general disdain for crossplay. We’ve reached out to both Gearbox and 2K Games to comment on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL6QIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news or bad news first? Good News: An update for Borderlands 3 has been prepared for release that includes full crossplay support across all platforms. Bad News: For certification, we have been required by the publisher to remove crossplay support for PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1397872712090099715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0g6Hfg"&gt;The source of the issue could be Sony. The recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial has revealed that Sony has a special agreement with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games to enable crossplay in the title on PlayStation consoles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;Epic Games had to agree to pay additional fees&lt;/a&gt; to Sony to enable &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;crossplay on PlayStation, and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed in testimony that Sony is the only platform holder that requires this compensation for crossplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQDfM4"&gt;“In certain circumstances Epic will have to pay additional revenue to Sony,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;revealed Sweeney earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. “If somebody were primarily playing on PlayStation, but paying on iPhone then this might trigger compensation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUEJBS"&gt;It’s likely that Sony has been seeking a similar deal with 2K Games for &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3 &lt;/em&gt;crossplay. &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; allows players to purchase cosmetic items like skins for their characters and vehicles. Sony takes a 30 percent cut on these purchases, and it’s clear from internal emails that the company has been against crossplay in the past for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk72hu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807138/sony-playstation-cross-network-play-xbox-block-response"&gt;Sony initially blocked cross-platform play&lt;/a&gt; for both &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;despite Nintendo and Microsoft both enabling players to play across Xbox and Switch. The issue really blew up when Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453628/fortnite-nintendo-switch-cross-play-sony-ps4-microsoft-xbox-one-e3-2018"&gt;blocked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454606/fortnite-nintendo-switch-ps4-block-accounts-cross-play-e3-2018"&gt;players were angry&lt;/a&gt;. Sony did eventually back down in late 2018 after the backlash, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support"&gt;new policy change to enable crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This year’s Pokémon Go Fest is also a music festival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgvdH0Lriw2c35ipUIKa97P9Rkk=/0x26:3840x2586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350056/20210521_gofest2021_hero_3840x2880.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art for the 2021 &lt;/em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;em&gt; Fest.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pl3X3a"&gt;Pokémon Go Fest is just a few weeks away, and this year, the annual event is also going to be a music festival, developer Niantic announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FNPfu"&gt;During the event, you’ll pick one of two Pikachu — Pikachu Rock Star or Pikachu Pop Star, which you can see in the image at the top of this post — and that choice will influence the music you’ll hear in-game throughout the fest. Longtime &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; developer Junichi Masuda has produced special tracks for the event, including “a rock-and-rolling track for Pikachu Rock Star fans” and “a high-energy electro-pop song for Pikachu Pop Star stans,” according to a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EXYo3H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tickets cost $5 this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FdwiI8"&gt;If you complete in-game activities during the festival, you’ll be able to encounter a mythical pokémon, though Niantic isn’t saying exactly which one it is yet. (I have a hunch it could be &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Meloetta_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"&gt;a certain music-themed pokémon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBHcGZ"&gt;This year, in honor of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go’s&lt;/em&gt; fifth anniversary, Niantic has also lowered the price of admission from $14.99 to just $5. That could make the event accessible to even more people — and it could mean even more players participate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdVN35"&gt;The two-day festival will take place on July 17th and 18th and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406090/pokemon-go-fest-2021-dates-july"&gt;will be held online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird announces its third-generation electric scooter with automatic emergency braking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L9aFnTXrDmuMoTl41MdPOJrVMY=/0x2:7178x4787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350065/B3_Press.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bird&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAqQRR"&gt;Bird is out with a new electric scooter that’s designed to be the Santa Monica, California-based company’s most durable and sustainable vehicle yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P10HT"&gt;The Bird Three scooter has a longer wheelbase, a dual-sensor throttle, and a “triple braking system” with dual independent handbrakes and an “autonomous emergency braking” system that the company claims is an industry-first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2vb0S"&gt;But specifications aside, the really interesting thing about the Bird Three is the company’s insistence on calling it a “micro-EV.” It’s a clear effort by Bird, which recently announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;intent to go public via a “reverse merger”&lt;/a&gt; with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to capitalize on the current momentum around electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R1244H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Autonomous emergency braking”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QWjbBx"&gt;With billions of dollars potentially on the line for the EV industry as part of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan, and legacy automakers pouring billions of their own money into the development of EVs, Bird sees an opportunity to align itself with the prevailing winds in the transportation sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmiWnT"&gt;“In the early days, these were really toys if I’m honest,” said Scott Rushforth, chief vehicle officer at Bird, of the company’s original Xiaomi-manufactured products. “We used off the shelf products that didn’t last as long as we’d like them to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="addsnm"&gt;But that’s changed with the development of more rugged and longer-lasting scooters, earning them the automotive grade title “micro-EV,” Rushforth said. “It really is an EV that’s been shrunken down into the micro form factor,” he added. “So I love that term and I think that it’s hopefully going to become part of the dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17ZRNS"&gt;One of the most important numbers to consider is the lifespan of each scooter. The more trips and miles a single scooter can cover, the better it is for scooter companies that have to recoup the cost of each vehicle before they can start making money. With the Bird Three, the company thinks it has its longest-lasting scooter yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFloOL"&gt;That is partly why the company is staking a position against the use of swappable batteries. Other countries, like China, are embracing battery-swapping technology as a way to expand access to their electric vehicles. But Bird claims that “smaller and swappable batteries lead to higher overall manufacturing emissions and require more vehicle miles traveled to retrieve, replace, and recharge scooters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LyhNRD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Bird Three’s battery has a capacity of “up to 1 kWh”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IX5Q7c"&gt;Instead, the Bird Three’s battery has a capacity of “up to 1 kWh,” which the company says means less frequent charging and more miles traveled on a fully charged battery “than any other shared scooter available today.” That’s a significant step above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18535698/bird-one-electric-scooter-ride-share-own-price"&gt;Bird One scooter’s&lt;/a&gt; battery capacity of 473Wh, and about 150 percent more capacity than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20749511/bird-two-electric-scooter-battery-autonomous-sensors"&gt;the Bird Two&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEjlnT"&gt;The Bird Three battery is built to outlast the scooter to which it’s attached, with a minimum of 14,000 miles and up to a 20,000-mile lifespan. That’s probably longer than the 24- to 36-month lifespan of the entire vehicle, Rushforth said. And it’s IP68 rated, meaning it’s sealed from any water and dust that may get into the scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ekq9W"&gt;“You know what’s better than a swappable battery is a battery that you don’t really need to maintain,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TPRS9"&gt;The scooter can run over 200 diagnostic checks and can relay messages to Bird’s maintenance crew when repairs need to be made. And when there’s a problem that would make the scooter unsafe to ride, the automatic emergency braking will bring the vehicle to a stop. Rushforth likened it to regenerative braking in an electric vehicle, in which the vehicle comes to a stop when the driver takes their foot off the acceleration pedal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTLEni"&gt;The Bird Three will be deployed in only a handful of markets to start out, including Tel Aviv, Berlin, and New York City (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;kicking off its inaugural scooter sharing pilot&lt;/a&gt; in June). After that, the company will begin the process of swapping the new scooter for the older models that need to be retired — which could take a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fleFO1"&gt;“It doesn’t make any sense for us to recycle a vehicle that’s out there getting rides,” Rushforth noted. “That’s not very green to just like get rid of the vehicles before their lifespan has ended.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is bringing Smash and Splatoon esports to high schools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0SVAA20g4PWG9c3LLH82G7cmLs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350007/Switch_Splatoon2_4.0_090618_PressKit_SCRN_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fgkN5p"&gt;Nintendo is expanding its esports efforts by moving into high schools. The company has announced a new partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.playvs.com/"&gt;PlayVS&lt;/a&gt;, which will see games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15986256/splatoon-2-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced into varsity athletics starting in the fall. “What’s magical about this opportunity is that it’s a way for kids to participate, to compete against their peer levels, and to do so as part of high school athletics,” Nintendo’s Bill Trinen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DErF6p"&gt;PlayVS is an amateur esports platform that has partnerships with state and national high school athletic associations, turning competitive gaming into officially recognized competition. It currently operates at three age brackets — youth, high school, and college — with games including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqjK3P"&gt;As part of the partnership with Nintendo, both &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; will become officially sanctioned varsity sports when the high school fall season kicks off on September 20th. Early next year, &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; will be added as well. Nintendo will also be providing copies of the games and a year-long Switch Online subscription to “3,000 select qualifying schools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w39yJ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our first next step in terms of how we can support competitive communities.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkU8TD"&gt;According to Delane Parnell, founder and CEO of PlayVS, many high school esports programs already featured Nintendo games in an unofficial capacity, making it a good fit. “I was at a school not long ago, and they have a &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; program organized internally at the school,” he says. “And they’re really excited at the prospect of being able to play &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; against other schools in their state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ5ZtO"&gt;For Nintendo, it’s in part a promotional opportunity, opening up these games to a new audience. But Trinen also describes it as “our first next step in terms of how we can support competitive communities.” In the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579392/nintendo-big-house-super-smash-bros-melee-tournament-slippi-cease-desist"&gt;Nintendo has had a somewhat rocky relationship with the grassroots communities around these games&lt;/a&gt;, but the company sees this as a chance to expand its footprint in the space. (Nintendo’s esports approach has historically been much more hands-off compared to competitors like Riot or Blizzard, which operate their own professional leagues and tournaments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0ZoLE"&gt;“We view it as a great opportunity to help kids who have an interest in video games, to be able to experience some of the camaraderie, some of the team-based atmosphere that you get with these programs,” says Trinen. “We felt that the high school level was a great place to start. At that level you’re starting to see kids who are already spending time playing the game, their skill level is pretty high, and the interest is there in terms of the competitive side of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG7NIR"&gt;When it came to selecting games to be featured as part of the program, he adds that “&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; are two franchises where the communities have really done a fantastic job of building up a scene and helping to establish them as competitive titles.” As for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, it was chosen as a more approachable option. “I think it’s one that, from an intimidation factor, is a lot lower than a lot of other games. Having something like that in the mix helps broaden the overall appeal of the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnLB1x"&gt;Trinen says that, as the partnership continues, Nintendo will look at potentially expanding to other age categories. There might even be some new games added into the mix. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15759936/arms-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, being a favorite of mine, is definitely in the back of my mind as a potential candidate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s ‘biggest change’ to Outlook for Windows improves shared calendars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGkg8DCqF2KaMmv3bZcw-ly44pM=/0x0:1214x809/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349856/outlookforwindows.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dpoun3"&gt;If you’ve ever had to share an Outlook calendar with colleagues, you’ll know how painful it can be when things go wrong. I spent a decade of my professional career in IT support, and shared calendar problems with Outlook for Windows were a daily problem. &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/outlook-for-windows-shared-calendar-public-notifications/ba-p/2388836"&gt;Microsoft is now promising&lt;/a&gt; that it is “dramatically” improving the reliability of shared calendars in what it’s describing as “arguably the biggest change to Outlook for Windows since its initial release in 1997.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2vFUy"&gt;Microsoft first started testing a new shared calendars experience for Outlook last year, and it’s now starting to roll out more broadly. Improvements include much faster sync times for new meetings and updated meetings, meaning changes should instantly be reflected in everyone’s version of a shared calendar. In the past, Outlook for Windows has often taken too long to sync calendar changes, resulting in meetings disappearing, calendars getting out of sync, and lots of other calendar headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRcvLg"&gt;“Since summer 2019, we polished the experience and fixed bugs, thanks to many customer reports,” says Microsoft’s Exchange team. “With tens of thousands of daily users on the preview, we feel confident now that the experience is going to delight calendar delegates.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_V0UezOloluYw6IH8ikauDjLFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542998/026_Thumbnail.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has been testing these calendar changes for nearly a year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0pcCs8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/calendar-sharing-in-microsoft-365-b576ecc3-0945-4d75-85f1-5efafb8a37b4?ui=en-us&amp;amp;rs=en-us&amp;amp;ad=us"&gt;shared calendar changes&lt;/a&gt; are starting to roll out to Outlook for Windows users gradually. Microsoft says it has around 10 percent of Outlook for Windows users with the improvements enabled and that it will “keep expanding gradually throughout the spring and summer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvqgTJ"&gt;Users of Outlook on the web, the new Outlook for Mac, and mobile versions of Outlook are already benefiting from these calendar sync improvements. Now a fix is finally on the way for users of the dedicated Outlook for Windows app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ Digital WellPaper visualizes your app usage as a funky live wallpaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpryvxeOLlUMS8rsTpF-lxjp4pg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349776/Comp_w_Frame.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps are put into five categories, each represented by a color in the live wallpaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uugzT"&gt;OnePlus’ new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fwellbeing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22456248%2Foneplus-digital-wellpaper-app-usage-visualization-live-wallpaper" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital WellPaper app&lt;/a&gt; turns your app usage into one of three live wallpapers on Android. Apps are simplified into six categories — social, lifestyle and communication, entertainment, gaming, information and business, and tools — which translate to six colors within each wallpaper that become more or less prominent as you use the apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TndbK"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104987/google-digital-wellbeing-pixel-android-9-pie-exit-beta-features-now-available"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; already have the ability to track app usage at a system level, but generally you have to go into a dedicated menu to actually see the information. The advantage with Digital WellPaper is that it puts this usage information — albeit in an abstract form — front and center, so you’re aware of it every time you look at your home or lock screen. OnePlus says it hopes this will help Android users “visualize and better understand their day-to-day digital habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3bUECgoZKWtlT76gDaJqRlwf1BQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542909/Glow_w_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The live wallpapers are also available as lock screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvr1pO"&gt;Google has experimented with similar initiatives in the past. In 2019 it released a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928613/google-digital-wellbeing-experiments-unlock-clock-we-flip-morph-post-box-desert-island"&gt;experimental Digital Wellbeing apps in the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalwellbeingexperiments.unlockclock"&gt;Unlock Clock&lt;/a&gt;, a live wallpaper that shows a tally of how many times you’ve unlocked your phone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4BT52"&gt;OnePlus says the new app, which was “curated” by its internal experimental software team OneLab, should work without consuming too much of your phone’s battery. It’s just generating a new image once when you unlock your phone, rather than constantly updating in the background. More details on individual app usage can be found within the Digital WellPaper app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcEQThvX5yHeDI3YK09_zb9697k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542908/Screen_Time_w_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;More detailed information is available in-app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAePKc"&gt;Digital WellPaper is now available from the Google Play Store, and works on devices running Android 7.0 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Instagram really learned from hiding like counts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IN5vBJKI4mDCdrJ6VvRpRM0oPhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349575/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AFnYYP"&gt;In April 2019, amid growing questions about the effects of social networks on mental health, Instagram announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523847/instagram-hide-likes-test-canada"&gt;it would test a feed without likes&lt;/a&gt;. The person posting an image on the network would still see how many people had sent it a heart, but the total number of hearts would remain invisible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IDa39"&gt;“It’s about young people,” Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-hiding-likes-adam-mosseri-tracee-ellis-ross-wired25/"&gt;that November&lt;/a&gt;, just ahead of the test arriving in the United States. “The idea is to try and depressurize Instagram, make it less of a competition, give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them. But it’s really focused on young people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w42bSt"&gt;After more than two years of testing, today Instagram announced what it found: removing likes doesn’t seem to meaningfully depressurize Instagram, for young people or anyone else, and so likes will remain publicly viewable by default. But all users will now get the ability to switch them off if they like, either for their whole feed or on a per-post basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDJlED"&gt;“What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some, and annoying to others, particularly because people use like counts to get a sense for what’s trending or popular, so we’re giving you the choice,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-people-more-control"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DyPhQB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It did end up being pretty polarizing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GVOQE"&gt;At first blush, this move feels like a remarkable anticlimax. The company invested more than two years in testing these changes, with Mosseri himself telling &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; he spent “a lot of time on this personally” as the company began the project. For a moment, it seemed as if Instagram might be on the verge of a fundamental transformation — away from an influencer-driven social media reality show toward something more intimate and humane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrsH0X"&gt;In 2019, this no-public-metrics, friends-first approach had been perfected by Instagram’s forever rival, Snapchat. And the idea of stripping out likes, view counts, followers and other popularity scoreboards gained traction in some circles — the artist Ben Grosser’s Demetricator project made a series of &lt;a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/instagram-demetricator/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; that implemented the idea via browser extensions, to positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYPJzI"&gt;So what happened at Instagram?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WeVku"&gt;“It turned out that it didn’t actually change nearly as much about … how people felt, or how much they used the experience as we thought it would,” Mosseri said in a briefing with reporters this week. “But it did end up being pretty polarizing. Some people really liked it, and some people really didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cwewm2"&gt;On that last point, he added: “You can check out some of my @-mentions on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLYSt4"&gt;While Instagram ran its tests, a growing number of studies found only limited evidence linking the use of smartphones or social networks to changes in mental health, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/technology/kids-smartphones-depression.html"&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt;. Just this month, a 30-year study of teenagers and technology from Oxford University &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/05/04/study-finds-no-link-between-time-teens-spend-on-tech-devices-and-mental-health-problems/"&gt;reached a similar finding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXUeDY"&gt;Note that this doesn’t say social networks are necessarily &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for teenagers, or anyone else. Just that they don’t move the needle very much on mental health. Assuming that’s true, it stands to reason that changes to the user interface of individual apps would also have a limited effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UESrG"&gt;At the same time, I wouldn’t write off this experiment as a failure. Rather, I think it highlights a lesson that social networks are often too reluctant to learn: rigid, one-size-fits-all platform policies are making people miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boT2KK"&gt;Think of the vocal minority of Instagram users who would like to view their feed chronologically, for example. Or the Facebook users who want to pay to turn off ads. Or look at all the impossible questions related to speech that are decided at a platform level, when they would better be resolved at a personal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIZbGZ"&gt;Last month, Intel was roasted online after showing off Bleep, an experimental AI tool for censoring voice chat during multiplayer online video games. If you’ve ever played an online shooter, chances are you haven’t gone a full afternoon without being subjected to a barrage of racist, misogynist, and homophobic speech. (Usually from a 12-year-old.) Rather than censor all of it, though, Intel said it would put the choice in users’ hands. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22374120/intel-bleep-voice-chat-hate-speech-censor-spirit-ai"&gt;Ana Diaz at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0eshlY"&gt;The screenshot depicts the user settings for the software and shows a sliding scale where people can choose between “none, some, most, or all” of categories of hate speech like “racism and xenophobia” or “misogyny.” There’s also a toggle for the N-word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7O0Njg"&gt;An “all racism” toggle makes us understandably upset, even if hearing all racism is currently the default for most in-game chat today, and the screenshot generated many worthwhile &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beesmygod_/status/1379940286927937540"&gt;memes and jokes&lt;/a&gt;. Intel explained that it built settings like these to account for the fact that people might accept hearing language from friends that they won’t from strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6qcCi"&gt;But the basic idea of sliders for speech issues is a good one, I think. Some issues, particularly related to non-sexual nudity, vary so widely across cultures that forcing one global standard on them — as is the norm today — seems ludicrous. Letting users build their own experience, from whether their like counts are visible to whether breastfeeding photos appear in their feed, feels like the clear solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo0qe4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Expanded user choice is clearly in the interest of both people and platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMbFJ8"&gt;There are some obvious limits here. Tech platforms can’t ask users to make an unlimited number of decisions, as it introduces too much complexity into the product. Companies will still have to draw hard lines around tricky issues, including hate speech and misinformation. And introducing choices won’t change the fact that, as in all software, most people will simply stick with the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Otv4Ut"&gt;All that said, expanded user choice is clearly in the interest of both people and platforms. People can get software that maps more closely to their cultures and preferences. And platforms can offload a series of impossible-to-solve riddles from their policy teams to an eager user base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxo7Vg"&gt;There are already signs beyond today that this future is arriving. Reddit offered us an early glimpse with its policy of setting a hard “floor” of rules for the platform, while letting individual subreddits raise the “ceiling” by introducing additional rules. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; a world in which users will be able to choose from different feed ranking algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78M7cT"&gt;With his decision on likes, Mosseri is moving in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goJYGw"&gt;“It ended up being that the clearest path forward was something that we already believe in, which is giving people choice,” he said this week. “I think it’s something that we should do more of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8hiszJ"&gt;
&lt;p id="BjUd9F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime Prime is the scooter company’s new monthly subscription service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Budapest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9atvOTJPCerUrQe5zvTZTPj0OVA=/0x0:4937x3291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349458/1227934486.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michal Fludra/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AFb70E"&gt;Lime is rolling out a new monthly subscription service for its electric scooters that’s called — no joke — Lime Prime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnnCZt"&gt;Lime typically charges a fixed rate to unlock a vehicle and then a per-minute fee to ride. For $5.99 a month, the company will waive that initial fee for Lime Prime subscribers. And in markets with no unlock fees, riders will receive 25 percent off the price of their ride. Subscribers will still pay the per-minute charge, but Lime says that someone who uses one of its scooters every day would save approximately $25 a month under the subscription plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sDck0f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first iteration of Lime’s subscription service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmN0bl"&gt;There are other perks that come with a subscription. Lime Prime members can reserve any scooter or bike for up to 30 minutes at no cost, for example, compared to just 10 minutes for a standard user. And for a limited time, the company is offering the first month of its new plan for free as a promotion to entice new customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uwxIf"&gt;Subscriptions are fast becoming a way for scooter- and bike-sharing companies to lock in more customers in the hopes of boosting their revenue stream. And this isn’t the first iteration of Lime’s subscription service. In 2019 the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;launched Lime Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly plan that also eliminated the unlock fee for subscribers. Prices varied for Lime Pass, but San Francisco subscribers, for example, were charged $4.99-a-week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmKIoB4YEKP8KsNboe7BuKDgDSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542933/Lime_Prime_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21Vv7gxCfBnN2OIIFXNaBGn3NOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542932/Lime_Prime_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WjoSF"&gt;Lime also isn’t the first scooter company to dabble in subscriptions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; has been experimenting with its own plan for its shared electric scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. Scooter manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;Unagi has a plan&lt;/a&gt; available in several cities in the US. And electric bikes are jumping on the subscription bandwagon, too, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;Revel in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Dance in Berlin, and Swapfiets and VanMoof as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okzim3"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service, Book, in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. And BMW recently discontinued its own subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGjGKm"&gt;Other automakers have had some success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199532/bmw-subscription-service-nashville"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16455246/porsche-car-subscription-service-launch"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888304/audi-subscription-service-monthly-fee-dallas"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720830/volvo-suv-subscription-plan-600-la-auto-show-2017"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143852/nissan-switch-subscription-service-price-model-vehicle"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464548/jaguar-land-rover-car-subscription-service-carpe-uk"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652907/hertz-my-car-subscription-rental-terms-enterprise"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514404/enterprise-car-subscription-service-rental"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tc4r9i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI hit with sweeping legal complaints over controversial face scraping in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YkGS7-19qM5py4VJwCi2B39Ok8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349431/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBV6I9"&gt;Privacy International (PI) and several other European privacy and digital rights organizations &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/get-out-our-face-clearview"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/2021.05.27%20-%20Clearview%20AI%2C%20Inc.%20-%20Privacy%20International%20Complaint%20%28ICO%29%20%5BRedacted%5D_0.pdf"&gt;they’ve filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against the controversial facial recognition company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt;. The complaints filed in France, Austria, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom say that the company’s method of documenting and collecting data — including images of faces it automatically extracts from public websites — violates European privacy laws. New York-based Clearview claims to have built “the largest known database of 3+ billion facial images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LvDsd"&gt;PI, NYOB, Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, and Homo Digitalis all claim that Clearview’s data collection goes beyond what the average user would expect when using services like Instagram, LinkedIn, or YouTube. “Extracting our unique facial features or even sharing them with the police and other companies goes far beyond what we could ever expect as online users,” said PI legal officer Ioannis Kouvakas in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ewFcX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Far beyond what we could ever expect as online users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aahFFj"&gt;Clearview AI uses an image scraper to automatically collect publicly available photos of faces across social media and other websites to build out its biometric database. It then sells access to that database — and the ability to identify people — to law enforcement agencies and private companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvA2kF"&gt;The legality of Clearview AI’s approach to building its facial recognition service is the subject of a number of legal challenges globally. Authorities in the UK and Australia &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-09/australia-u-k-open-joint-investigation-into-clearview-ai"&gt;opened a privacy probe&lt;/a&gt; last year into the company’s data scraping techniques. In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canada’s privacy commissioners determined that&lt;/a&gt; Clearview’s face scraping is “illegal” and creates a system that “inflicts broad-based harm on all members of society, who find themselves continually in a police lineup.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOJquN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/beslut-tillsyn-polismyndigheten-cvai.pdf"&gt;Swedish police were fined&lt;/a&gt; by the country’s data regulator for using Clearview’s offerings to “unlawfully” identify citizens. And &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/clearview-ai-deemed-illegal-eu"&gt;in one case in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the Hamburg Data Protection Agency ordered Clearview to delete the mathematical hash representing a user’s profile after he complained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dkOT3"&gt;In the US, Clearview was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;sued by the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Illinois in 2020 for violating the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act. The results of that lawsuit contributed to the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its product to private US companies&lt;/a&gt;. Clearview also faced legal action in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174613/clearview-ai-sued-vermont-attorney-general-facial-recognition-app-database"&gt;Vermont, New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-03-09/clearview-ai-lawsuit-privacy-violations"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mc2Q9"&gt;The privacy watchdogs say regulators have three months to respond to their complaints. In the meantime, you can request any data Clearview might have on you &lt;a href="https://clearview.ai/legal#data"&gt;via the email and forms provided on its site&lt;/a&gt; and ask that your face be omitted from client searches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google makes it easier to transfer Gmail photos to Google Photos</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q07CPsKOb9vrqNJMSRbM1YwPgHk=/0x0:512x341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69349421/UseSaveToPhotosOptionPreviewingImageInGmail.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Save to Photos option.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2R0dtE"&gt;Google is adding a new “Save to Photos” button to Gmail which you can press to automatically save an emailed image to Google Photos, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/save-photos-from-gmail-messages.html"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s rolling out to personal Gmail users, Google Workspace, G Suite Basic, and G Suite Business customers over the next couple of weeks and will be available alongside the existing “Add to Drive” button. Unfortunately it only works on JPEGs for the time being. Sorry PNG stans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9Wui3"&gt;It’s a good time to be getting a more convenient way to add images to Google Photos, because the service’s storage options are getting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424528/google-photos-storage-limit-date-15gb-cap-deadline"&gt;big overhaul on June 1st&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the service’s unlimited storage for “high quality” photos will disappear and will be replaced with a 15GB cap. Importantly, any images uploaded before the change comes into force won’t count towards the new limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzZOqd"&gt;In other words, start smashing that “Save to Photos” button and make the most of your free uploads while they’re still available. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451607/google-photos-high-quality-storage-saver-tool-free-space-blurry-screenshots"&gt;exhaustive explainer&lt;/a&gt; for a complete rundown of the changes coming to Google Photos next month, including how they apply to Pixel owners who got free Google Photos uploads as part of their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
