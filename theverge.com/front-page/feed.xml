    <title>Apex Legends is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch on March 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4zxOen3TvaYO7Ws3tOaXQC0eQE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759650/ss_8616ccdae08da0793a2f1d9b52997170eb0a1e25.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cOIKF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Nintendo Switch very soon. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/switch-launch-march-2021"&gt;EA announced&lt;/a&gt; that the portable version of its sci-fi battle royale will debut on Nintendo’s tablet on March 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ped5Yk"&gt;Chad Grenier, &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;’s game director, says the new version will include “cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.” &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; originally launched in early 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296353/ea-apex-legends-switch-steam-crossplay-titanfall-2-sims-4-way-out"&gt;a Switch version was announced last June&lt;/a&gt;. It’s developed by Respawn, the studio behind games like &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXOx5A"&gt;The Switch version launches not long after the game’s eighth season, which launches today. To make up for the difference, EA says that “since we’re launching a few weeks after the start of season eight, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their season eight battle pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeTfvA"&gt;Nintendo’s device is steadily becoming a great portable option for some of the biggest free-to-play multiplayer games around, with &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; joining titles like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Spellbreak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The rise of the GOP Poster’s Caucus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Opening Day Of The 117th Congress On Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIdb283-6eEn6LyN9l7JLks9eaU=/36x0:5877x3894/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759553/1230412906.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7crxcI"&gt;It was September 2018, while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was testifying before Congress for the first time, when sitting lawmakers had their first confrontation with the wild nature of the online right. Nearly 90 minutes after the hearing began, Laura Loomer, a far-right internet celebrity, stood up from the committee audience. “Please help us Mr. President before it is too late,” Loomer yelled, selfie stick in hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xALHs"&gt;She said something about “censoring” and then something about “shadowbanning,” although it was hard to make out the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0WI06"&gt;“What is she trying to say?” Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) asked, before pretending to lead a live auction, imitating an auctioneer’s call to drown out Loomer’s voice and forcing her out the hearing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQWHFl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alt-Right conspiracy theory peddler Laura Loomer just crashed Jack Dorsey's Congressional testimony.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USRepLong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USRepLong&lt;/a&gt; began mocking her &lt;a href="https://t.co/aQiAwnmeoE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aQiAwnmeoE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jordan (@JordanUhl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1037414684994007040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMNZTz"&gt;It was a jarring moment, but as Republicans struggle with the rise of QAnon — and, more specifically, the bizarre conspiracies spread by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — the moment may have had more to say about the party’s future than anyone realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8hU9o"&gt;Since 2016, the Republican Party has gone from nearly getting into fistfights &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/5/17823322/alex-jones-info-wars-senate-intelligence-committee"&gt;with conspiracy posters like Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt; to sharing offices next door to them on the Capitol grounds. Republicans have dipped in and out of the conservative internet ecosystem, one concentrated with misinformation and conspiracy, at times that were most politically expedient for them and their party. But Greene’s new spot in Congress is showing how powerful that ecosystem is and how difficult it will be for the party to shed. For a growing portion of the Republican Party, governance is now secondary to content, and the challenges of holding office aren’t so different from the hustle of a popular YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4I5jm"&gt;While far-right conspiracy theorists trolled Congress in 2018, Greene was building her own facsimile of a following online. That same year, Greene posted to Facebook suggesting that the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, which left 17 people dead, was a “false flag” operation, a classic falsehood peddled by people like Jones online. It was this post, first reported &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/false-flag-conspiracy-theory/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-facebook-2018-parkland-school-shooting-was"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paired with a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html"&gt;from CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that uncovered messages from Greene supporting the execution of prominent Democrats that forced Republicans to finally address her online history, something broadly known for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGXlqh"&gt;Greene’s first few weeks in Congress have led to more content than compromise. She’s introduced dead-on-arrival articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden and was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter/index.html"&gt;already suspended from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for violating the platform’s rules on election misinformation after posting that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/17/957891462/twitter-suspends-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-s-account-temporarily"&gt;some races across the country&lt;/a&gt; were falsely called for Biden. Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) announced last week that she would be moving her office farther away from Greene and described an altercation the two had in the hall over masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MESpR"&gt;Later that week, Greene put out a video of the incident where she wasn’t wearing a mask properly, mirroring the look and behavior of right-wing provocateurs like Loomer or disgraced former Staten Island congressional candidate and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20689402/joey-salads-youtube-campaign-congress-trump-republican-political-bias"&gt;YouTube prankster Joey Salads&lt;/a&gt;; the camera was shaky, held vertically, and pointed at her face as she talked about her day in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XoeqE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To Greene, this content and its consequences are their own kind of success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5NHISu"&gt;To Greene, this content and its consequences are their own kind of success — something far more valuable than a co-sponsored bill or a spot on a powerful committee. After Democrats called to expel her last week, Greene said she raised &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-she-raised-16-million-after-calls-for-her-expulsion/DOPUOGZ66FGV5CUGHATP2RXRFY/"&gt;over $1.6 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1355263214020419586?s=20"&gt;In a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Greene said, “I will never back down. I will never give up. Because I am one of you. And I will always represent you.” She continued, “I knew this day would come, it was only a question of when.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIIfM"&gt;If that sounds like the kind of non-apology you’d hear from a teenage YouTuber, it’s no coincidence. For Greene, governing &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;posting. Her meteoric rise from Facebook influencer to congressperson is a symptom of the algorithm-based social media feeds of our time. In 2017, Greene first posted about QAnon. “Have you guys been following 4chan? Q? Any of that stuff?” Greene said &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rtYok4fdbQ"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. “Q is a patriot, we know that for sure.” Greene makes increasingly more outlandish claims for the same reason prank YouTubers and their stunts become even more dangerous: the more controversy she generates, the larger her audience becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ArO1j"&gt;Greene has become the face of the Republican Party’s “Poster’s Caucus,” where messaging and content reigns supreme over policy. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) said &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/new-republican-congressman-prioritizes-punditry-over-policy-n1255967"&gt;in a letter to colleagues last week&lt;/a&gt; that he would be focusing on communications over legislation as well — and for good reason. Cawthorn’s biggest wins have been &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/03/madison-cawthorn-reacts-winning-seat-congress-cry-more-lib/6155257002/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://madison-cawthorn.myshopify.com/"&gt;merch drops&lt;/a&gt;. That’s simply what his audience expects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNyrA1"&gt;If Republicans have largely remained silent over Greene’s bizarre approach to politics, it’s because they understand the value of Greene’s connection with her audience. It’s a more extreme version of a game conservative lawmakers have been playing with the online right for years. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year, conservative YouTuber Dave Rubin made a similar observation, saying that lawmakers needed him more than he needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1bSwN"&gt;“It was Dan Crenshaw who reached out to me. It was the Ted Cruz people who reached out to me. It was Rand Paul people who reached out to me,” Rubin told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21489979/biden-trump-presidential-dabate-election-youtube-ben-shapiro-dave-rubin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They clearly see the seas changing in terms of where people are getting their news, and that they need an opportunity to have their ideas heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqN5hV"&gt;Political parties have long struggled with their base, and courting media figures has often been a part of it — from Walter Winchell to Rush Limbaugh. But the novel dynamics of the internet have made the base more extreme and alienated it from the conventional dynamics of government. While lawmakers focus on stimulus checks and a second Trump impeachment, online channels are talking about pedophilia rings and antifa super-soldiers, creating a bizarre alternate reality with no meaningful connection to the actual functions of Congress. Using open platforms and independent companies, the usual moderating forces — like corporate standards departments or advertiser boycotts — just aren’t a factor. For figures like Alex Jones or Laura Loomer, there’s simply no reason to reengage with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RKkd5"&gt;With Greene, that kind of logic is now part of the Republican House delegation, and it’s still hard to say how party leaders will respond to this new force. House Democrats are pushing hard to marginalize Greene, pointing to her unhinged and often anti-Semitic statements. While some Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell (R-KY) condemned Greene, calling her embrace of conspiracy theories a “cancer for the Republican party,” others have been quiet. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said he would talk to Greene about her social media posts last week, but it’s not clear when that meeting will take place, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxbRzw"&gt;It’s easy to see why McConnell is scared. This delay from Republicans and McCarthy is only providing Democrats &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/democrats-marjorie-taylor-greene-ultimatum-464382"&gt;with more ammo for future elections&lt;/a&gt;, tying the GOP with QAnon or any other conspiracy they grab on to before November 2022. That shell game might be good for subscriber numbers, but it’s bad for the GOP — and if leaders aren’t careful, they may end up the party of Alex Jones instead of the party of Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjJNZP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest earnings cap off a sterling 2020, despite the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BLtXg_W7dC_V4Bk2s0Zyowyyrg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759525/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dg1Jn6"&gt;Amazon founder and soon-to-be-former CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;is stepping down from his role&lt;/a&gt;, making way for Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy to take his place, and the company couldn’t be in better shape financially for the big transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spBgp0"&gt;Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has kept growing bigger during times that have strained many other businesses. In its Q4 2020 earnings release this afternoon, the company reported net income more than doubling to $7.2 billion for the quarter, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period in 2019. Amazon’s full-year 2020 net sales were up 38 percent, to $386.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYQ0pE"&gt;There’s a little more to unpack in these Q4 earnings than one might usually see. For 2020, Amazon shifted its Prime Day shopping event from the middle of summer to mid-October, which likely gave its numbers a big boost. And in doing so, it basically kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever, with more people at home shopping exclusively online to avoid in-person gifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F7I0g"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Amazon-Q4-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;latest earnings release&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t feature a lengthy statement from Bezos, who more recently had reserved this spot for announcing the company would commit huge amounts of money toward COVID-19 research and prevention. Instead, Bezos used it as a place to rattle off Amazon’s biggest inventions that have grown in popularity under his control, capping off his era as the CEO of the largest, most profitable company on the planet. He’ll remain CEO until Q3 2021, when Andy Jassy will take over.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s next car will seamlessly unlock with UWB, FCC leak suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8I5GbKAWbEj6hTFDNNXzebGoDOQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759439/acastro_180724_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WD5Mi1"&gt;Apple and Samsung have been quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;contributing to a new technology to find and  seamlessly unlock your car with your phone&lt;/a&gt;, without even pulling it out of your pocket — and Tesla may be one of the first with the tech. Tesla is actively working on building UWB into its cars, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXsVLw"&gt;On September 9th, the company submitted six new “products” for the FCC’s consideration, including two key fobs, a security controller, and a number of “endpoints” that would be installed inside the frame and cabin of a vehicle:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnBE51dFq8WGJXV7QPurNnSscBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276933/image__14_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNrGoR"&gt;According to the FCC documents, at least three of those products explicitly support UWB communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6NgDD"&gt;What’s more, Tesla’s FCC filing is unusual in that it includes &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEIM-1614283/Operational-Description/Operation-Description-5073259"&gt;a complete operational description of the technology&lt;/a&gt;, something that’s usually redacted. The highlights: it’s a standards-based implementation of UWB, which means UWB phones from Apple and Samsung should theoretically be compatible, and it’s designed to let you know how far away you are from the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3OjSC"&gt;That "ranging" is helpful to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/10/17842136/tesla-key-fob-hack-theft-spoofing-relay"&gt;replay attacks&lt;/a&gt; that try to trick your car into thinking its key fob is closer than it actually is. But it also theoretically unlocks the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;find your car in a crowded parking lot&lt;/a&gt; using your phone, something Samsung is already planning to release an app for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dazmgirpnE3YWn_I6mj0hynLw5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276974/tesla_uwb_description.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection from Tesla’s operational description of the tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QV831p"&gt;When I spoke to UWB chip supplier NXP last year, company CTO Lars Reger told me that future cars would likely need several of these UWB endpoints inside the car, possibly at the door handles, to properly triangulate your location and know whether you’re inside or outside so, say, your kids won’t be able to turn on the engine if you’re not actually in the cabin. Apparently, Tesla thinks the B-pillars (located between the front and rear side windows of a car) and a piece of fascia might be good places to put those antennas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCoqL6T7PI462FpkkVk4Q20YJcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276944/tesla_keyfob.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A drawing of the inside of one of the UWB key fobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pvNXFm"&gt;None of this means that Tesla will necessarily add the tech to its cars, but FCC documents are usually a pretty good sign that it’s not just an experiment. FCC filings are typically one of the last waypoints before a product comes to market, as they’re only required if you’re going to import, sell, or do widespread testing of a radio product in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eivC6h"&gt;Last we checked, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW was the only other automaker&lt;/a&gt; that’s committed to UWB. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="V6ocrJ"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet weathered the tail end of 2020 to &lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd"&gt;post better-than-expected earnings&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth quarter of the year. But the bigger story is that Alphabet broke out Google Cloud’s sales for the first time ever, revealing an eye-popping $5.6 billion annual loss last year, but a nearly 50 percent jump in revenue (to $13 billion) compared to 2019. And Google Cloud maintained that growth well into the fourth quarter, when the division generated $3.8 billion in sales. That’s a 46 percent jump from the fourth quarter of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k72qbe"&gt;Those numbers are notable for a few reasons: Google Cloud lags behind the competition, in particular Microsoft’s Azure platform and Amazon’s dominant Amazon Web Services, the CEO of which was just promoted to run the entirety of Amazon now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;co-founder Jeff Bezos is stepping back&lt;/a&gt; into an executive chairman role in a surprise announcement this afternoon. But the division’s fast-growing revenues, second only to the search giant’s core ad business, suggest Google could become a major cloud player and fiercer competitor to Azure and AWS in the years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GKupIo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Cloud lags behind Azure and AWS, but it’s growing fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8xlY5q"&gt;The message is now clear: cloud computing is the dominant business for these major tech titans, and the execs who can excel in the cloud industry are stepping in to take the reins of  the entire business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella famously ran Azure before he took over for Steve Ballmer, and Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian was a top exec at Oracle before replacing VMWare co-founder Diane Green in the top Google Cloud role. These are the people running the show at the most important divisions of the most important tech companies, until they get promoted to steer the entire ship apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzTHfl"&gt;In many ways, Google’s cloud business is going through the same growing pains its competitors once did; it took AWS nearly 10 years to become profitable for the first time, and it’s now a more than $45 billion annual business. But Google is facing an uphill battle, one that will take a considerable time and financial investment to come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z81Hfx"&gt;Thankfully, Alphabet is not dependent on Google’s cloud business, as Amazon relies on AWS, to make considerable profit every quarter, thanks to Google’s dominant ad business that brought in a staggering $52.9 billion in revenue last quarter alone and nearly $170 billion for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HwX5g"&gt;The Google Services division’s profit margins there are immense — Google made more than $19 billion in net income for the fourth quarter of 2020, a 41 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. YouTube also continues to grow at a steady clip. The video site posted more than $6.8 billion in revenue last quarter, a 47 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKLndM"&gt;The always fluctuating Other Bets division — which includes Alphabet’s X lab, Waymo, and other non-Google companies — took in $196 million last quarter and $657 million in all of 2020, but it also posted an operating loss of $4.48 billion for the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wikipedia introduces new Universal Code of Conduct to fight harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eC6j_wVvyGSQsIpyd-p5YSwhE7s=/131x0:1904x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759366/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.55.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JrFvxD"&gt;Wikipedia has &lt;a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2021/02/02/wikipedia-embraces-first-of-its-kind-universal-code-of-conduct/"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Universal_Code_of_Conduct/Policy_text"&gt;Universal Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; that looks to create a global standard for the site and ensure a “diverse, inclusive, and accessible” community of contributors, continuing its efforts to fight harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyUjKb"&gt;The formal code of conduct — like many Wikimedia projects — was a crowdsourced project, with over 1,500 volunteers from around the world contributing. It’s intentionally designed to be relatively short and easily comprehensible to users, measuring in at a brisk 1,600 words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzn6Ec"&gt;Broadly speaking, the new code of conduct is broken down into two categories: positive behavior that’s expected from users, editors, and Wikimedia employees, and unacceptable behavior that the company looks to discourage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBrDUY"&gt;Expected behavior includes having mutual respect for others, engaging in constructive editing, and respecting things like personal pronouns for other contributors. The code of conduct also encourages users to help support each other on projects and to mentor new editors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ammhv4"&gt;On the flip side of things, the code of conduct explicitly calls out harassment — be it insults, sexual harassment, threatening language, doxxing, or bad faith arguments — along with “any behavior intended primarily to intimidate, outrage, or upset a person.” Abuse of power is similarly banned, as is content vandalism, hate speech, and “deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate, or inappropriate content” to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouR130"&gt;The code of conduct &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21269482/wikimedia-foundation-anti-harassment-code-of-conduct-vote"&gt;follows the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; of plans to enact more formal policies against harassment and inappropriate behavior on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GvWRro"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wikimedia is writing new policies to fight Wikipedia harassment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21269482/wikimedia-foundation-anti-harassment-code-of-conduct-vote"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J4wVzD"&gt;The new Universal Code of Conduct is just the first part of the company’s efforts to define encouraged and unacceptable behavior on Wikipedia. Defining bad conduct is a good place to start, but right now, Wikimedia has yet to codify any universal policies for what happens when bad actors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; harass other users or spread misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSa8OA"&gt;Wikimedia is already working on that second phase of the Universal Code of Conduct, which will establish how both local and regional Wikipedia projects will enforce the new requirements and any consequences for those who break those rules. But the company is still in the early stages here — that part of the project &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Universal_Code_of_Conduct#Timeline"&gt;likely won’t be complete&lt;/a&gt; until late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhF6rP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will have a new CEO as Jeff Bezos transitions to executive chair later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myObr0yaB2Nz7wXhl62wGk1FbY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759143/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NzQvvY"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;will step down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; and transition to a new position at the company as executive chair of the Amazon board in Q3 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=Dm1MOGqy6o4"&gt;Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt;, who currently serves as CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), will replace Bezos as Amazon CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA4c8H"&gt;“Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;commented Bezos in an email&lt;/a&gt; announcing the change. “As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and my other passions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YgOzz1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos is stepping back to better focus on projects like the Bezos Earth Fund and Blue Origin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw3beK"&gt;Bezos has served as Amazon’s CEO since he founded the company in 1994, and he has presided over the e-commerce giant as it grew from an online bookstore into one of the most dominant technology companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4YWwd"&gt;Under Bezos’ stewardship, Amazon has come to rule over internet commerce, established itself as a backbone of the infrastructure of the modern web through its Amazon Web Services products, built a subscription empire around its Amazon Prime services, launched popular technology products like the Echo and Kindle lines of devices, and even started dabbling in physical retail through grocery stores and an acquisition of Whole Foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46vEDx"&gt;Bezos has also prospered as head of the company, with skyrocketing wealth that (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;until just a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;) made him the single richest human on Earth, with a net worth of nearly $180 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaoVr4"&gt;Bezos’ transition to executive chairman of Amazon’s board will mean he’ll be slightly more removed from the day-to-day business of running the nearly $1.7 trillion company, allowing him to focus his “energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” Those projects will include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$10 billion Bezos Earth Fund&lt;/a&gt;, which Bezos established last year, and Blue Origins, his aerospace firm, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509198/blue-origin-new-shepard-test-launch-nasa-payload-watch-live-time"&gt;recently resumed test flights&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOC4VT"&gt;Jassy is a familiar face at the company, having joined back in 1997. He has led the Amazon Web Services team since it was founded in 2003 and was named the CEO of AWS in 2016. The choice of Jassy — who has headed Amazon’s cloud service business since the beginning — over a retail or hardware executive is a telling one for Amazon’s priorities as a company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2p1y8"&gt;Amazon’s cloud business is a huge part of the company (and the internet at large, to the point where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;AWS outages&lt;/a&gt; can take down whole swaths of internet for hours), and its new leadership choice reflects that. It’s also a parallel to other major tech CEOs, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5169852/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo"&gt;Microsoft’s Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt;, who was similarly an instrumental part of the company’s cloud and server business before taking charge of Microsoft in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1OlOh"&gt;It’ll still be some time before Jassy takes over, though — Bezos isn’t set to transition to his new role until Q3 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS appears to just be a forked version of Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="huawei" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5WlBTNUf0uld9UdFsx5duTpxpE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758861/VRG_ILLO_1777_Huawei_004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bmwHs"&gt;HarmonyOS is Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;alternative operating system&lt;/a&gt; that was created after the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;banned in the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;lost its Android license&lt;/a&gt;. The reality is the operating system is less of a new alternative and more of a slapdash fork of Android 10, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;a new report from Ron Amadeo at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvu2dR"&gt;HarmonyOS was initially pitched as a wholly distinct OS from Android and iOS, something that would be just as at home on smart home appliances (like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873710/huawei-vision-4k-tv-announced-features-mate-30-pro-event"&gt;Honor Vision TV&lt;/a&gt;) as it would on smartphones. The announcement was a hopeful promise that losing access to US businesses wouldn’t stop Huawei from innovating, but Amadeo’s experience with the beta highlights some disappointing discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eujOB3"&gt;Getting developer access requires a two-day background check that includes sending copies of your passport, personal ID, and credit card to Huawei&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yqieKq"&gt;You don’t actually run the beta OS in its emulator; it’s streamed to you, Google Stadia-style, from (presumably) a phone running the beta in China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iwqJcC"&gt;Most importantly, HarmonyOS seems to be a fork of Android 10 with the word “Android” find-and-replaced with “Harmony”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow4yn5"&gt;HarmonyOS was likely always going to be most popular in China, but the fact that the new OS appears to be a continuation of Huawei’s EMUI skin with potentially slower access to Android updates through the Open Source Android Project is a major strike against it being used anywhere else. It might be good enough to not offend the US government and satisfy Chinese authorities, but quick text edits and an invasive application process do not an appetizing operating system make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXBHz"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;Amadeo’s whole deep dive&lt;/a&gt; of detective work dissecting the beta, along with some jabs at Huawei’s fluff-filled developer documentation for a hypothetical “super virtual device,” over at&lt;em&gt; Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVd9u16rXqTZwykb9t8sVIxO1dM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67799392/acastro_201109_4282_gamingHeadsets_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZkrThV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones might aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhUUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sxpL6zcXsuLE6hAiQUeioEP8vfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973780/cfaulkner_201016_4245_0001.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9IDJD"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the HyperX Cloud II Wireless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DcjeD9"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/tab2gajv/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YdssKP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSU9zw"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21404415/astro-a20-gen-2-next-gen-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-wireless-headset"&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SrrIBJ"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy an additional $20 wireless adapter to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntDrFp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4o0BxC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j1b0Ap"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (even though it comes at a $20 cost to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. I found the wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver to be quite good. My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EG0ble"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the Astro A20 Gen 2:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X96DFR5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=2109b1c7eddf9e19cf8013a2da0e4ba9&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kVCQQA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;Razer Kaira Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5FyUOH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FuzXKAnHOyvPWuGUIY0MkDYOf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22011747/kairapro1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here are the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVMs6W"&gt;As I’ve found with most headsets made to take advantage of the Xbox wireless protocol, range can be an issue. In my studio apartment, I started hearing audio crackling when I was just 15 feet away from the wireless adapter plugged into my PC, but your mileage may vary. Despite the convenience of not having to use a dongle with your Xbox console, I think I’d prefer to have one if it means better wireless range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCR4fx"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rqp5TG"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/v41rvhkk/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Mo7J1Z"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cgE2YH"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525271/corsair-hs75-xb-wireless-review-pc-xbox-specs-features-price"&gt;Corsair HS75 XB Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qgNCwe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DEYyCC8eHCj_067ddJD309hdr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21977171/cfaulkner_201020_4249_0005.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox, or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and a styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2FmFG"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Corsair HS75 XB Wireless sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0CvhdO"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/fr05lrgf/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets from manufacturers like Turtle Beach and LucidSound. Though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rOlW"&gt;For instance, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Premium-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Console/dp/B08D45WDR7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=89ece5e076095169f2188aa3e8230262&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) sounds great and has USB-C charging, but its fit is tight and it’s uncomfortable to wear after a while. Your experience may vary depending on your head size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99&lt;/a&gt;) and SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are also good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. Both offer better comfort than the Stealth 700 Gen 2, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fD8Ib3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; sounds great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;one of the most comfortable options on this list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oeTf6a"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UW01so"&gt;Best wired gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;Bose QC 35 II gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MPJACg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR255W"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oHaXwr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUH1Gy"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 + sound card&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;USB sound card&lt;/a&gt;, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63tBlJ"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some really interesting options out there. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be better for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good, HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNPSZVP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=d134f5aa0a291f3f43cb53e066c7546d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C wired headset that has a simple design and a sound profile that’s pleasant to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. My complaints with this one are on the minor side, with its sizing adjustments not holding very well and its voice prompts sometimes being confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QJEfi2"&gt;The Sennheiser EPOS 601 (&lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming/products/gsp-601-gaming-headset-1000413"&gt;$220&lt;/a&gt;) nails the fundamentals, with great sound and a quality microphone. But the ear cups are too darn big, and that excess spills into its overall design. It’s also too expensive for a relatively basic wired headset that doesn’t offer but a couple of special features, like replaceable sidearm plates and a twist-to-adjust volume knob.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ App Lab offers a new way to try early access VR apps without sideloading</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KUK8g0"&gt;Oculus has detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Flatest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262794%2Foculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;what’s coming in its v25 software update&lt;/a&gt; for Quest and Quest 2 headsets. The most notable change for both developers and users is App Lab, a new method for distributing in-development VR apps that doesn’t require Oculus Store approval and also doesn’t require sideloading. Think of this software as the equivalent of early access for VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0hwXX"&gt;Oculus shared in its press release that it wants to keep the bar for quality high for its store, so it’s splintering off App Lab apps from its main storefront. But it wants to foster a community where developers can openly and easily share their in-progress creations with Quest owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPsKo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Something like App Lab has been long awaited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHUwxr"&gt;After a developer &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=latest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger"&gt;submits their App Lab app to Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, users can access it easily through a URL, or they can be found by searching for their exact name in the Oculus Store. SideQuest, a popular site that hosts applications and games that can be sideloaded onto the Quest headset, &lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/news/2374/oculus-app-lab-integration-official-support-on-sidequest"&gt;will also host App Lab apps&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, many of the apps and games hosted there might soon get App Lab support, making it easier for people to try some of the experiences hosted there without sideloading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmfoLg"&gt;App Lab grants developers the ability to broadly open their apps up to the general public to try or to generate unique keys if you want to only allow certain people to access them. And from the user’s perspective, any App Labs apps you download can be found in your Quest library of apps and games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="App Lab" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abM-VG3F3R7dtxw2t6S9Vyz_aA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276707/145439647_859112401546343_5034401412607724516_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These apps have debuted on App Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oL3dxJ"&gt;Oculus says that over 10 App Lab titles have launched, including the experiences pictured above. Though, &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/"&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt; presented an error when I clicked them at the time of publishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbnKnN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/release-notes/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=latest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger"&gt;Several other features&lt;/a&gt; are coming in this update, including Messenger for VR, allowing you to keep Facebook chats going while you’re immersed in your Quest headset. The Oculus release notes also mention “Stationary Guardian 2.0,” bringing some more quality-of-life improvements for when you want to safely use VR while in a stationary location instead of using roomscale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYhE3d"&gt;Whether you use VR software in roomscale or stationary mode, Oculus’ Passthrough shortcut is now easier to access and no longer buried in its experiments settings. The feature allows you to see your surroundings through the Quest or Quest 2’s outward-facing cameras by double-tapping the section where the headband meets the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOIXfr"&gt;In case you’ve ever wanted to pair a Bluetooth mouse to your Quest headset, you’ll soon be able to do that, too. To find this feature, head to settings, click “Experimental Features,” and you should find it there soon. &lt;/p&gt;
