    <title>Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam, Epic will try to make it work</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVcxLA"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value. But Steam could also be avoiding controversy with the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2VLSl"&gt;Steam is one of the most well-known PC game stores, but it’s not the only one. While Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, that policy doesn’t seem to apply to games in its store: &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22493091"&gt;Epic told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “open” to the idea of games that use NFTs or cryptocurrencies in an email on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkI3KB"&gt;Looking at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210826165938/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;a Wayback Machine capture of Steam’s rule page from late August&lt;/a&gt;, there are only 12 rules and no mention of cryptocurrencies or NFTs. The new rule is also missing from other documents — it currently doesn’t show up on the &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/"&gt;Joining the Steamworks Distribution Program page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMxaqo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Steam's point of view is that items have value and they don't allow items that can have real-world value on their platform. While I respect their choice, I fundamentally believe that NFTs and blockchain games are the future. It's why I started this journey with all of you.&lt;br&gt;3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Age of Rust (@SpacePirate_io) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AOvwC"&gt;Steam has a history of making controversial moderation decisions, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17417790/steam-pornography-rules-guidelines-porn-visual-novels"&gt;when it comes to games with sexual content&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, though, it doesn’t seem like people are pressing F to pay respects to NFT games — a majority of the replies and quote tweets to SpacePirate’s tweets are praising Valve for the move (or mocking those that are upset about it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52ry6n"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m9r447"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2XNch"&gt;It’s perhaps understandable why Steam would want to avoid having NFTs on its platform. Besides the justification cited by SpacePirate that they could have real-world value (which seems a bit weak, given the massive commercial communities around things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/14/12186584/valve-gambling-statement-counter-strike"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/em&gt; hats), NFT and crypto-based games don’t have the best reputations. There’s the infamous Evolved Apes saga where a developer sold NFTs with the promise that they’d be included in a fighting game but then &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dyem/investors-spent-millions-on-evolved-apes-nfts-then-they-got-scammed"&gt;seemingly took the money and ran&lt;/a&gt;. There are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;potentially interesting game concepts that use NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to say how many of them would’ve been a good fit for Steam even if they were allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E7tPBT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFTs may become a big question in platform moderation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmrBVc"&gt;Steam and Epic’s different approaches highlight the fact that any platform or store that moderates content will likely have to make a decision about whether it wants to allow apps or games to sell NFTs — one of the biggest question marks right now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448054684128878592"&gt;may be Apple&lt;/a&gt; and how it handles apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684372/opensea-app-nft-ios-android-apple-google"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723131/coinbase-nfts-crypto-marketplace"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; should they decide to start letting users buy the digital tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntLlHb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 15th, 6:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with information from Epic that it’s open to blockchain-based games on its store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic says it’s ‘open’ to blockchain games after Steam bans them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nEgoi9-vLVEEZckDBQtq5tGv4Ak=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001923/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i37MNz"&gt;Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s “open to games that support cryptocurrency or blockchain-based assets” on its game store, unlike its competitor Valve which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;has banned games that feature blockchain technology or NFTs from Steam&lt;/a&gt;. When we asked about allowing games that featured NFTs, Epic told us there’d be some limitations, but that it’s willing to work with “early developers” in the “new field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wydB5N"&gt;Epic says that the games would have to comply with financial laws, make it clear how the blockchain is used, and have appropriate age ratings. It also says that developers won’t be able to use Epic’s payment service to accept crypto; they would have to use their own payment systems instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZUyCOD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic will clarify its rules in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JBrbON"&gt;Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, but that statement now appears to only apply to its own games. Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will clarify the rules as it works with developers to understand how they plan to use blockchain tech in their games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1GANJ"&gt;This doesn’t mean that developers spurned by Steam can rush out and throw their game up on the Epic Game Store. Currently, Epic’s self-publishing program &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/publish"&gt;is in closed beta&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic’s FAQ says it chooses who can join on a “case-by-case basis.” Epic, however, has shown itself to be a fairly permissive platform owner — something that became a point of contention in its trial with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;when lawyers brought up&lt;/a&gt; the “offensive and sexualized” games that were available on Itch.io, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;game store accessible on Epic’s game store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFO99b"&gt;Allowing games that Steam bans is another way that Epic could compete with Valve. Epic has already shown that it’s willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418782/epic-games-store-free-games-cost-apple-trial-arkham-subnautica-mutant-year-zero"&gt;make big bets&lt;/a&gt; trying to make its store a major player in the PC gaming space, and this could be another play to get some gamers or developers on its side. Some NFT fans immediately looked to Epic after the news about Steam broke. Enjin, a company that helps developers integrate NFTs into their products (&lt;a href="https://www.ageofrustgame.com/enjin"&gt;including SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089?s=20"&gt;tweeted about their game being taken off of Steam&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/enjin/status/1449113287291981826"&gt;retweeted our Steam article&lt;/a&gt;, and tagged Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, asking to talk. It seems now they have at least one question answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QCCPCd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Disappointed to see short-sighted decisions that are directly impacting our adopters like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SpacePirate_io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TimSweeneyEpic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@EpicGames&lt;/a&gt; let's chat? &lt;a href="https://t.co/oQ8Y9OScS8"&gt;https://t.co/oQ8Y9OScS8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Enjin (@enjin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/enjin/status/1449113287291981826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s is testing the McPlant, a Beyond Meat meatless burger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New McPlant McDonald’s burger" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tuq7ehbHiF_WK7FksiM5Rbu7VdQ=/113x0:1328x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001802/mcplant_mcdonalds_beyond_meat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by McDonald’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mG8wnh"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, aptly named the McPlant, is coming to eight restaurants across the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/mcdonalds-to-test-mcplant-which-includes-its-own-meat-free-burger-next-year-beyond-meat-shares-fall.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The fast-food chain teamed up with Beyond Meat to make the meatless option. This comes about a year after McDonald’s ended its P.L.T. pilot, another Beyond Meat branded burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9VN7a"&gt;It’s still unclear what the differences are between the McPlant and the P.L.T., other than the name. A &lt;a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.mcplant-usrestaurant.html"&gt;post on McDonald’s website&lt;/a&gt; says that the McPlant patty will contain peas, rice, and potatoes and will also be topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and American cheese. That sounds a lot like the P.L.T., but we won’t really know until the start of its test on November 3rd. It’s also important to note that the McPlant will be cooked on the same grill as beef burgers, so it might not be classified as purely vegan or vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0reOM"&gt;McDonald’s briefly ran the P.L.T. in Canada from 2019 to 2020. And as &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; noted, at the time, McDonald’s said that it had no plans to resurrect the burger. Something must’ve changed McDonald’s thinking — maybe it was the results from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262481/mcdonalds-mcplant-burger-denmark-sweden-test-markets"&gt;McPlant test that it’s been running in Sweden, Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, the Netherlands, Austria, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhGGC9"&gt;Meatless options have been growing in popularity at fast-food restaurants, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290336/burger-king-impossible-burger-st-louis-meat-free-meatless"&gt;Burger King kicking off the trend with the Impossible Whopper&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Other chains also hopped on the bandwagon that same year, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758429/subway-beyond-meatball-marinara-sub-meatless-restaurant-testing-us-canada"&gt;Subway introducing the Beyond Meatball Marinara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833145/beyond-meat-kfc-fried-chicken-test-plant-based-sample-date"&gt;KFC piloting plant-based fried chicken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5KODX"&gt;If your mouth waters just thinking of the McPlant, you’ll soon be able to find it at McDonald’s in Irving, TX; Carrollton, TX; Cedar Falls, IA; Jennings, LA; Lake Charles, LA; El Segundo, CA; and Manhattan Beach, CA while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Human rights activist suing Twitter for allegedly giving Saudi spies access to his info</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKlF-nu8K5Hvn5dRwaiBQeha_1I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001707/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qMSOOT"&gt;A Saudi human rights activist has filed a lawsuit against Twitter, alleging that the company hired two people who spied on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia and accessed his personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBjAG"&gt;Ali Al-Ahmed, head of the human rights advocacy organization Institute for Gulf Affairs, has frequently been critical of the Saudi government. Twitter, Al-Ahmed claims, did not have the right to disclose or share his private information under its own privacy policy and should have done more to protect his information. He names two men in the suit &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930394/indictment.pdf"&gt;who were indicted last year&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) by federal prosecutors for working as agents of the Saudi government while working for Twitter several years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG8xQF"&gt;Al-Ahmed also claims in the lawsuit that his Twitter account was suspended in 2018 without explanation and has yet to be reinstated despite repeated appeals. The lawsuit alleges that the company has kept Al-Ahmed’s Arabic-language account inaccessible so as not to displease the Saudi government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYC2rQ"&gt;“While Twitter may wish to play the victim of state-sponsored espionage, Twitter’s conduct in punishing the victims of this intrigue, including Mr. Al-Ahmed, tells a far different story: one of ratification, complicity, and/or adoption tailored to appease a neigh beneficial owner and preserve access to a key market, the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia],” the complaint states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7IaPc"&gt;Al-Ahmed is seeking reinstatement of his Arabic-language Twitter account and unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hHHVF"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="68gruE"&gt;

    <title>Moscow adds facial recognition payment system to more than 240 metro stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Face Pay launched at all Moscow Underground stations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3GUG-zSzh5ttgZyd6qs6hC0MNk=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001561/1235893124.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by TASS\TASS via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l9dT0o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mosmetro.ru/news/detail/?news=802"&gt;Moscow launched “Face Pay” on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, a facial recognition payment system implemented in more than 240 Mosmetro stations, “the largest use of facial recognition technology in the world,” officials claim (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service relies on stored photographs to validate metro payments, an obvious privacy concern given the previous uses of facial recognition technology by the Russian capital’s law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCs3tj"&gt;Face Pay requires metro riders to upload a photo and connect their bank and metro cards to the Mosmetro mobile app. With everything uploaded, all you need to do is look at the camera posted above the turnstiles to make it in time for your next train. Moscow authorities expect 10 to 15 percent of riders to use Face Pay “regularly” in the next two to three years, the hope being less time swiping and paying for rides will translate to shorter lines and waits, and less close contact during the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Face Pay launched at all Moscow Underground stations" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3J5IFYQVF9jL1IoI0QVS62zkQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930357/1235892999.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moscow’s head of city transport and road infrastructure Maxim Liksutov with a Face Pay camera. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mdtRa"&gt;That’s all fine and good, at least conceptually. The relative convenience biometric recognition can add to payment systems is a concept that’s currently being floated in the US through Amazon One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;the shipping giant’s palm recognition tech&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; notes, Moscow’s Department of Information Technology claims &lt;a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5030021"&gt;photographs collected through official channels won’t be turned over to the police&lt;/a&gt; and are instead securely encrypted in the GIS ETSHD system (Moscow’s Unified Data Storage and Processing Center).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ktyfCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not hard to imagine the metro system turning into a valuable surveillance tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bZyTC"&gt;That hasn’t convinced Russian privacy advocates, though. “This is a dangerous new step in Russia’s push for control over its population. We need to have full transparency on how this application will work in practice,” Stanislav Shakirov, the founder of digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “The Moscow metro is a government institution and all the data can end up in the hands of the security services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm2Z9Q"&gt;Shakirov has good reason to be concerned. Moscow’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378164/moscow-facial-recognition-cctv-arrests-crime-surveillance"&gt;implementation of facial recognition across its vast network of more than 10,000 CCTV cameras&lt;/a&gt; is more than a little scary. Worse than the possibility of abuse by local Moscow law enforcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561018/moscows-facial-recognition-system-crime-bribe-stalking"&gt;the system can apparently be hijacked&lt;/a&gt; for as little as $200 by enterprising hackers. That’s the real risk of applying facial recognition across even more of daily life in the city, not just that the government could have an easier time tracking the movements of citizens, but that the system itself is a vulnerable target for even worse abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Busta Rhymes has questions about NFTs, and he has NFTs for sale</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0nBah"&gt;You can’t always take Busta Rhymes &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1699317/mayan-apocalypse-busta-rhymes/"&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/08/24/busta-rhymes-goes-on-anti-mask-rant/"&gt;you shouldn’t take his questions seriously at all&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from this morning about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; is solidly in line with the disturbing reality of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hz6zAQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SHOULD I BUY A HOUSE… or.. A LINK TO A PICTURE OF A PIXELATED MONKEY&lt;/p&gt;— Busta Rhymes (@BustaRhymes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cmvUjv"&gt;I won’t give you, or Busta, any help with your investment or trading decisions. However, understanding that some NFTs are a link to a picture on a server &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726556/signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-nft-whim-change-platform-shit-emoji-fragility"&gt;that could change or disappear&lt;/a&gt; is information worth knowing before you spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency on a digital collectible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs0KLv"&gt;And yes, Busta Rhymes is talking about crypto and NFTs for the same reason almost anyone else is. Just like every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725019/fox-maskverse-masked-singer-nft-community-blockchain-collectables"&gt;TV network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;sports league&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22705818/dc-free-superhero-nfts-register-fandome-event"&gt;comic book publisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1443714943086366721"&gt;he has a few of them for sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix just fired the organizer of the trans employee walkout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj54EgP9dAwP8AGQkM1a1fcVMmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000779/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lfxHM"&gt;Netflix has fired a leader of the trans employee resource group who was organizing the upcoming October 20th walkout. The employee, who is Black and currently pregnant, asked not to be named for fear of online harassment. They have been encouraging trans employees and allies to walk out of work in protest of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix’s handling of the Dave Chappelle special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The employee declined to speak to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41xJf"&gt;“All these white people are going around talking to the press and speaking publicly on Twitter and the only person who gets fired is the Black person who was quiet the entire time,” says a former employee in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s absurd, and just further shows that Black trans people are the ones being targeted in this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgBrDn"&gt;The employee was terminated on suspicion of leaking metrics to the press related to the Dave Chappelle special. Those metrics — about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;and how many people it reached — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;subsequently ended up in a report on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the employee had shared the metrics internally, they spoke out against the leaks to colleagues, worried they might hurt the walkout movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzbWk7"&gt;The leaking of internal data is highly unusual at Netflix. While the company prides itself on transparency, employees are told that the culture can only thrive when Netflix data remains internal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvHqbQ"&gt;A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the employees’ dismissal. “We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” they said. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZv8uc"&gt;Controversy surrounding &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which was widely criticized by trans activists for being transphobic, has roiled Netflix in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;The company suspended Terra Field&lt;/a&gt;, a trans software engineer who posted a viral tweet thread about the controversy, for attending a director-level meeting to which she wasn’t invited. Field has since been reinstated. The company is now sending employees details about what meetings they’re allowed to attend. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removed a popular Quran app in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fr6SfD1_9WZ82v4l6sH0JHOyxoI=/180x0:2574x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000499/Screen_Shot_2021_10_15_at_10.07.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pakistan Data Management Services&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N1lmKj"&gt;Apple has removed &lt;a href="https://quranmajeed.app/"&gt;Quran Majeed&lt;/a&gt;, a popular app for reading and listening to the Quran, from the App Store in China, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230"&gt;the BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly removed the app at the request of government officials, a somewhat surprising move given Islam is a protected religion in the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVvcIw"&gt;Quran Majeed is available for free and “recognized by 25 million Muslim users around the world” &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id365557665"&gt;according to the app’s developer&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan Data Management Services. The app’s removal apparently had nothing to do with its religious content, “according to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal,” the developer told the BBC. The developer says it’s now attempting to resolve the issue with China’s Cyberspace Administration. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both Apple and China’s US Embassy for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cGVML3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How China complicates Apple’s chest-thumping about privacy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TcFlQv"&gt;Without clearer explanation, the move seems like a possible overreach, though it does fall within &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf"&gt;Apple’s official stance on human rights abroad (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HC0Pmo"&gt;We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward. With dialogue, and a belief in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our users—their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and helpful technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k2v4Kb"&gt;While it’s logical for business, that framing has placed the company in questionable positions before. Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html"&gt;removed VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; that allowed Chinese users to avoid censorship and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-privacy-censorship.html"&gt;proactively filtered out apps&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama, or Taiwanese and Tibetan independence. Apple’s suppliers in the region &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;have also been connected&lt;/a&gt; to the oppression of China’s predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5wah6"&gt;Apple is in a difficult situation either way. It relies on the business relationships and sales it makes in China. Taking a strong stance against the government could put that in jeopardy. Just this week, Microsoft made the decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726189/microsoft-linkedin-china-censorship-shut-down"&gt;to shut down the local Chinese version of LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging separately that it is becoming increasingly difficult to comply with the Chinese government’s demands. Apple hasn’t yet found that line for itself, and with how much it relies on China to make its iPhone business work, it might not happen anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is salty about Pixel’s switch to Tensor but really shouldn’t be</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jtps-yBH1njQApS6SOZjpkkEdCY=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000489/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbRw0I"&gt;The Google Pixel 6 phones will ditch Snapdragon chips for an in-house design, and Qualcomm is clearly feeling a little hurt about it. Qualcomm couldn’t help but throw some shade at Google — in the form of a red flag meme on Twitter (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/15/qualcomm-google-tensor-snapdragon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"&gt;Google revealed its Tensor chip&lt;/a&gt;, which will make a proper debut at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Pixel 6 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. This marks the end of an era where Pixel phones — and most of Google’s earlier Nexus line — relied on Snapdragon SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8j0N8"&gt;The red flag meme started as a way to identify silly “warning signs” when dating but has since evolved to the point where it can apply to almost anything. Qualcomm came up with this questionable take on the meme, implying that Google’s choice to swap out the Snapdragon for the Tensor was a poor decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rxINZh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"We've decided to make our own smartphone SoC instead of using Snapdragon"                      &lt;/p&gt;— Snapdragon (@Snapdragon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1448317606365179906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ItrR5a"&gt;But the reality is that most Pixel users see the Tensor as something bringing exciting improvements to the device. When we got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;sneak peek at the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, Google showed off the benefits of a chip designed to make AI and machine learning processes more efficient. During the demo, we saw how the Pixel 6 could correct blurry photos, shoot better videos, and accurately transcribe speech to text — all features Google credits to the new Tensor chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IadzQ"&gt;Twitter users posted scathing replies to Qualcomm’s tweet, pointing out that, thanks to the Tensor, Pixel users will also no longer have to deal with the limited support period for Qualcomm chipsets. A recent leak suggests the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;Pixel 6 series will receive five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;, which should help extend the life of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptxzj5"&gt;Couple that with the fact that, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;points out, Google is one of Qualcomm’s smaller customers, and Qualcomm’s tweet becomes laughable. Qualcomm still provides chips for some of the biggest smartphone manufacturers, including Samsung, which &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266220/global-smartphone-market-share-by-vendor-in-2007-and-2008/"&gt;sold 17 percent of all smartphones globally&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rolls out Safety Score-based insurance product in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model S redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0zzBFMFcccqSxS0AICt3YFQ9Lg=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000355/MS_Performance_Hero_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYOj3h"&gt;Tesla is now selling insurance to customers in Texas, two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837265/tesla-car-insurance-california-autopilot-discount"&gt;first launching the offering&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;now-former home state&lt;/a&gt; of California. But the version in Texas is different. The company says it will evaluate driving behavior in real-time using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;“Safety Score” feature&lt;/a&gt; that it recently launched to screen drivers who want to join the beta test of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hsZIn"&gt;That means drivers might wind up paying less — or more — per month based on how many forward collision warnings they rack up, how hard they brake, how “aggressively” they turn, how much distance they leave to the car in front, and whether they keep their hands on the wheel when using Autopilot. Tesla used some driving behavior metrics to develop premiums in California, but they were not real-time and relied more on &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/22/tesla-tsla-launch-in-house-insurance-program-more-states/"&gt;statistical evaluations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBhO6"&gt;The offering in Texas represents a big break from how other insurance companies arrive at their quoted premiums. Even ones that rely on data from telematics dongles plugged into a car still consider other factors like age. Tesla is, unsurprisingly, promoting those differences (via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oCYRxZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike other telematics or usage-based insurance products, Tesla does not require an additional device to be installed in your vehicle. Tesla uses specific features within the vehicle to evaluate your premium based on your actual driving. You will make monthly payments based on your driving behavior instead of traditional factors like credit, age, gender, claim history and driving records used by other insurance providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OGpjH5"&gt;The company claims owners could pay premiums that are anywhere between 20 percent and 60 percent cheaper than the competition if they opt to use Tesla’s insurance. While other insurance providers relentlessly promote that they offer lower rates to safer drivers, the new version of Tesla’s insurance product could offer the most tangible version of that promise, as long as it works as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1agon9"&gt;Tesla has been working to expand its insurance offering to other states, but CEO Elon Musk announced at the company’s recent shareholder meeting that Texas would be the first to follow California. Musk also announced at that meeting that he was relocating Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;headquarters to Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where the company has spent the last year building its next US automotive factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsDzB6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
