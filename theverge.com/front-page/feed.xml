    <title>Disney Plus hits 94.9 million subscribers, beating its four-year goal in 14 months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Mandalorian" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1M0rMXAaY5Jf6uadtKdQCQ_AmEc=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806212/HUC2_FF_003556.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FJi26x"&gt;Disney Plus reached a new high of 94.9 million subscribers around the world, the company announced in its Q1 2021 earnings report. Hulu now has 39.4 million subscribers, while ESPN Plus has 12.1 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMaeoj"&gt;The strong numbers for Disney Plus show a noticeable jump from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;86 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; Disney announced it had reached at its investor day in December 2020. The surge in subscribers likely came from holiday streaming releases of major titles like Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; and the final episodes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zlYQYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney Plus is doing better than Disney ever imagined&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rQpgZe"&gt;It also means that Disney has already crossed its original 90 million subscriber goal for the service — a number the company originally expected to take four years to reach. The company has &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-86-8-million-subscribers-1234850846/"&gt;since revised that four-year plan&lt;/a&gt; with a new goal of reaching between 230 million and 260 million subscribers by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnpnrS"&gt;Notably, that 94.9 million benchmark was as of January 2nd, 2021, which means it doesn’t factor in possible boosts in subscribers that Disney may have received from the debut of its first Marvel Studios TV series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was released on January 15th. Assuming the highly anticipated show has caused a similar bump in subscribers, it’s possible that Disney has already managed to cross the 100 million subscriber mark by now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4rTzYR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 52 things Disney just announced","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fS8tHq"&gt;Overall, Disney’s direct-to-consumer streaming business is up 73 percent year over year, with revenue of $3.5 billion. Disney is still working on increasing the amount of money it actually makes from its nearly 100 million Disney Plus subscribers, though: average monthly revenue per paid subscriber dropped to $4.03 per subscriber, in part because it’s now factoring in Disney Plus Hotstar (available in India and Indonesia), which charges considerably less than the service in other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Axkx"&gt;Disney is planning to help boost those numbers in the coming months, though, with its first price increase for the service in the US set to arrive next month: starting on March 26th, Disney Plus will cost $7.99 per month or $79.99 per year (up from $6.99 a month or $69.99 per year). The Disney bundle — of Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus will also see a $1 increase to $13.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="71waDk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming was one of the brighter spots for Disney in its quarterly earnings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PVr3cb"&gt;Streaming was one of the brighter spots for Disney in its quarterly earnings. While the company beat expectations, with total revenue of $16.25 billion, revenue was still down more than 20 percent year over year. That’s largely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shuttered the company’s cruise ship business and heavily limited the number of customers it can host at its parks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZIJFV"&gt;Similarly, limited movie theaters have forced the company to delay many of its major blockbusters, although a similar reduction in marketing and distributing those films means that film delays have had less of an impact on Disney’s business overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z0L1g"&gt;Disney is continuing to focus on its direct-to-consumer offerings in the coming months: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165950/disney-star-streaming-service-hotstar-international-movies-tv"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;, its replacement for Hulu for international customers, will release in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand on February 23rd. &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is set to debut on Disney Plus as a paid Premier Access title on March 5th, along with Marvel shows &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; in March and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; in May. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;recently announced dozens of new Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and Disney shows and films&lt;/a&gt; planned for the streaming platform for the next several years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft are getting less unprofitable, but COVID-19 is still a drag on their business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeElLBGx7Xxif5eP3mhq9LsG3Vo=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806094/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hougm8"&gt;Uber and Lyft reported their quarterly earnings this week, and while both companies are showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cast a long shadow over the overall ride-hailing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvPCaM"&gt;It raises the question of how both companies, neither of which have ever turned a profit, can hope to claw their way out of the deeper financial pit in which they’ve been cast by COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9auZ7q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 was a brutal year for Uber and Lyft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLZogC"&gt;Uber lost $968 million over the last three months, with its adjusted net revenues down 16 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the entire year, the company reported a net loss of $6.7 billion, down slightly from the $8.5 billion it lost in 2019. It brought in less revenue compared to 2019 — $11.1 billion versus $13 billion — likely due to facilitating fewer trips, 5 billion in 2020 versus 7 billion in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTkA0M"&gt;On the flip side, Lyft lost $458.2 million over this past quarter, with its adjusted net revenues down a staggering 44 percent year over year. It lost $1.8 billion over the entire year, compared to $2.6 billion lost in 2019. (Both Uber and Lyft factor in stock-based compensation and payroll tax expenses into its net losses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzvrno"&gt;As coronavirus cases spiked in much of the country over the winter, Uber and Lyft started to lose a significant portion of their customer base. People stayed at home, or when they did go out, they opted not to use ride-hailing apps. Uber said it had 93 million “monthly active platform consumers,” its term for users who take at least one ride on Uber or buy at least one meal on Uber Eats — a 16 percent decrease year over year. Meanwhile, Lyft reported a drop in monthly active users of 45 percent, from 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 12.5 million in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSQ69N"&gt;They may offer nearly identical services, but Uber and Lyft have very different strategies for stabilizing their businesses. Uber’s plans involve growing the parts of its business that it perceives as doing well, such as food and grocery delivery, while shedding those line items that aren’t generating any revenue and likely would continue to be a financial drain for years to come. It acquired two delivery startups, Cornershop and Postmates, and sold off its micromobility, autonomous vehicle, and aerial taxi divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yxJckY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber is predicting that its delivery business will be profitable in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwIbHJ"&gt;Uber is predicting that its delivery business will be profitable in 2021. It’s certainly looking better than the company’s other line items: delivery gross bookings was $10.05 billion this year, up 130 percent from 2019. “While the external environment remains uncertain, I am more optimistic than ever about Uber’s future,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in an earnings call this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r5zFq"&gt;Delivery is no slam dunk for Uber; if anything, it could end up proving as risky as ride-hailing. Third-party delivery apps have &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/22224695/uber-eats-postmates-grubhub-delivery-wars-2021"&gt;come under fire in recent months&lt;/a&gt; for imposing exorbitant fees on already-struggling restaurants. Consumer pushback against UberEats and its competitors DoorDash and GrubHub is growing, while the companies are spending billions of dollars to grow their customer bases. But state legislatures are wary of the potential for food delivery to metastasize into something as problematic as ride-hailing and are already eyeing legislation to rein in onerous fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtNh98"&gt;Lyft, on the other hand, has no delivery service of its own, so instead, it’s focusing on reducing costs, and in some cases, reducing supply to help mitigate those costs — that means preventing new drivers from joining the app while reducing its spending on marketing and other incentives. “Given the effect on demand, we were able to reduce driver acquisition and incentive spend, which had a positive impact on our financial results,” Lyft CEO Logan Green said in an earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6f9QW"&gt;Uber has the resources to grow (and shrink) its way out of the pandemic, while Lyft does not. It needs to focus on staying small, but not too small that it can’t compete with its much larger rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWHe28"&gt;Despite a brutal year, the market has been kind to both Uber and Lyft. Lyft’s shares moved 14 percent higher in 2020, and the stock enters this trading week 23 percent higher than where it was at the start of last year. Uber’s shares shrank slightly after its earnings report, but the company still trades at a much higher revenue multiple than Lyft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHuyQB"&gt;Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft drivers are pushing ahead with their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227042/uber-lyft-prop-22-lawsuit-overturn-drivers-california"&gt;legal challenges against Prop 22&lt;/a&gt;, the ballot measure that allows the companies to continue treating their workers like independent contractors. President Joe Biden, who opposed Prop 22, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/biden-moves-to-oust-top-labor-board-attorney-robb"&gt;fired a Trump-appointed member of the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt; who authored several opinions affirming Uber and Lyft’s refusal to classify drivers as employees. And Democrats in Congress are hoping to push a bill that would echo California’s failed effort to make it harder for companies to treat workers as independent contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSkd9p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;The victory lap&lt;/a&gt; could be short-lived. Regulatory hurdles dot the road ahead for these ride-hailing companies. Profitability may be the least of their concerns. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kitty Letter is a new mobile word game from the creator of The Oatmeal, and it’s good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_h256sg-jcLCY15J-0LCiH7cGE=/48x0:555x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805998/header.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jCSbwy"&gt;Matthew Inman, the creator of &lt;a href="https://theoatmeal.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt; webcomics&lt;/a&gt; and popular card game Exploding Kittens, has released a free mobile word game &lt;a href="https://theoatmeal.com/blog/free_game"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Inman describes it as “Scrabble combined with &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgg5uk"&gt;In the game, you swipe around letters at the bottom of your screen to spell words, which sends small armies of cats marching toward your opponent in an attempt to blow up their base. Your opponent, meanwhile, is sending armies back at you to try to blow up yours. The mechanics are easy to pick up, and everything was in reach of my thumb, so I could easily play it one-handed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrxjNAmQr4rmWwQ0JrHV436fkRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22298371/IMG_0214.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A round of Kitty Letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhCZxs"&gt;I played the first few levels of &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;’s story mode, which not only served as a tutorial for the game’s mechanics, but also told a silly, &lt;em&gt;Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt; comic-like story. There were lots of funny drawings, offbeat gags, and even an extended section where I was forced to listen to a person make deer noises while backed by smooth Barry White-style soundtrack. If you like &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll probably enjoy the humor here. (I do, so I found it all very amusing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6wF8K5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbI4NA6K63I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Oazi"&gt;Best of all, it’s free to download, and the entire single-player story mode and its multiplayer mode are free to play. I’ll let Inman explain why he made the game free &lt;a href="https://theoatmeal.com/blog/free_game"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vuCUpd"&gt;I hate free-to-play games. I hate games built entirely around player retention and tricking people into keeping the app open as long as possible. I hate coins, currencies, chests, and other money-printing schemes disguised as fun. For Kitty Letter, I tried to just make the game as enjoyable as possible. This means that sometimes the chapters are long and almost seem to be discouraging you from playing. There’s an entire chapter built around slapping a trout in order to defrost it, and some musical deer that make sexy groans for way too long. I tried to just build a short-lived, likeable game, rather than a medicore game stretched across months of free-to-play garbage mechanics. Fuck retention. Fuck in-game currencies. Embrace the trout, I say. Embrace the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Hd8AWlO4vxA"&gt;groaning deer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HvTTsq"&gt;If you want, you can spend money on in-game cosmetics drawn in Inman’s signature style, but they’re not required to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY8b5I"&gt;You can download the game now from the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1510395712"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ExplodingKittensInc.KittyLetter"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak suggests Samsung Galaxy A52 and A72 will get high refresh rate screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SS2dhM1YtS8YGh3eYaM-clLcuAI=/319x0:3765x2297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805962/a52_5g_blass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked press render of the upcoming midrange Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Evan Blass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4anvg"&gt;Samsung may be getting closer to refreshing two popular midrange devices: the Galaxy A52 and A72. Leaked &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-first-official-images-updated-1611841113-938961111"&gt;press renders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a52-en-galaxy-a72-prijzen-in-europa/"&gt;prices&lt;/a&gt; have popped up over the last month, and now &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-a52-5g-and-a72-specs-include-high-refresh-rate-displays/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that the phones will get higher refresh rate screens. This is a welcome feature that’s trickling down from much pricier flagship devices; faster refresh rates make for a much slicker experience, with smoother animations and scrolling than the typical 60Hz screen offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gafjSJ"&gt;The A52 and A72 are both expected to sell in LTE and 5G versions; the LTE phones will allegedly have 90Hz displays, while the 5G versions get 120Hz panels. (&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; only indicates that the A52 5G will have the 120Hz screen, but it seems likely the A72 5G would, too.) A 90Hz panel isn’t unheard of in the A52’s budget / lower-midrange class — the $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with one — but it’s still uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgSqed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; also reports a few more specs for the A52 5G: it will include a Snapdragon 750G chipset, 6.5-inch OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery with 25W fast charging. It’s also expected to ship with Android 11. Variants with 6GB of RAM / 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM / 256GB of storage will likely be offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JK5sLy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy A51 has two good things going for it: the screen and the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Gvyvdi"&gt;On the camera front, it will allegedly include a 64-megapixel main sensor with a 12-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, and a 5-megapixel depth-sensing camera. It’s also reported to include a 32-megapixel selfie camera. It’s expected to cost around €450 (close to $550), while the non-5G model could cost $400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwqaeP"&gt;The Galaxy A51 was &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/best-selling-phones-2020_id126887"&gt;one of the bestselling phones&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in the first half of 2020, and Samsung looks keen to build on its success with attractive features like the higher refresh rate screen. We liked the A51’s high-quality screen and good build quality but found its processor to be a bit slow loading apps — something Samsung will want to rectify in this follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxOUzD"&gt;The A51’s 4,000mAh battery performance was also so-so. A higher refresh rate screen would likely require even more power, which may be part of the reason why this year’s model will allegedly offer a bigger battery. Capacity is only part of the equation, though, so it’s something we’ll keep an eye on when this device eventually makes its official debut.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K6bu9G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3607190/nvidia-rtx-30-graphics-card-shortages-gaming-gpu-gtx-1050-ti-geforce-rtx-2060.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld &lt;/em&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia is planning on releasing stock of GTX 1050 Ti and RTX 2060 GPUs to its board partners in an attempt to deal with the stock shortages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;and sky-high prices&lt;/a&gt; of its newer 30-series cards. At the moment, it’s not just new cards that people are having trouble getting their hands on — it’s any modern graphics card at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkMQDJ"&gt;While the GPUs that Nvidia is planning on releasing were meant to be affordable when they first launched, they’re certainly not now. The GTX 1050 Ti cost $139 when it launched in October 2016, but when I went looking for them on Newegg and Amazon, I found that Newegg itself only had one model in stock (which it was selling for $189), and third-party sellers were asking for $250, $340, and even $798.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3EPsXrt7vSOJyHmyJVggICDvOEM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297812/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_10.34.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;$139 when it launched four years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e452hY"&gt;If the 1050 Ti’s prices scare you, you might not want to look at what I found when I looked for RTX 2060s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18171616/nvidia-rtx-2060-gpu-349-ray-tracing-budget-entry-level-ces-2019"&gt;which launched in 2019 for $349&lt;/a&gt;. Newegg doesn’t currently have any 2060s in stock, but third-party sellers do, and they’re not letting them go for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of RTX 2060 prices, ranging from $799 to $1,644" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiU6E4ZIurhqC9_UMlAEmWI5rtw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297822/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_10.36.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I cry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4nmFgs"&gt;Hopefully Nvidia releasing the new stock will help bring the prices down, especially since it seems like new cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;won’t be particularly easy to get anytime soon&lt;/a&gt;. It also depends on how many of the older chips Nvidia can make. There’s been a global shortage of chips, affecting everything from laptops to trucks, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F02%2F03%2Fqualcomm-qcom-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22278562%2Fnvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some chipmakers are saying&lt;/a&gt; the industry is even having trouble producing chips that aren’t state-of-the-art (like the ones that would be found in older graphics cards). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zukjXp"&gt;The situation has gotten to the point that President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;pledged to do something about it&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to tell how effective that will be. If Biden wants to help with GPU prices, specifically, he could start by taking a look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;the 25 percent tariff&lt;/a&gt; that former President Trump put on graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PCGrgt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sure enough, EVGA and Zotac have raised prices on the Nvidia RTX 3080 and beyond","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"},{"title":"Nvidia and AMD address the great GPU shortage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LWqDSj"&gt;For now, your best bet is to keep an eye on prices for the GTX 1050 Ti and RTX 2060 to see if they go down, and only grab one if you desperately need a graphics card. Otherwise, it’s probably best to wait for the 30-series to become available again, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;we’re always keeping an eye out for&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at Medium are unionizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqOMB-8K2h8PDVrsHFwiiRUZsI0=/109x0:1513x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805784/MWU_Group_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mSG9Pv"&gt;Medium workers have announced they’re forming a union with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 9410. The Medium Workers Union says more than &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mediumworkers/status/1359942472479232001"&gt;70 percent of eligible employees have already signed cards in support&lt;/a&gt;, currently representing 140 workers across editorial, engineering, design, and product, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/11/media/medium-union/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BJMYI"&gt;The organization plans to negotiate a contract for its members. Right now, it’s asking Medium to voluntarily recognize the union. If the company refuses, the union can force recognition through the National Labor Relations Board as long as a majority of employees vote in favor of unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SqDG1"&gt;The Medium Workers Union is not putting out a list of demands and says it didn’t organize around a single issue. “We’re creating infrastructure for workers at Medium to have their voices strengthened and amplified by each other, much like the way writers use Medium to amplify their words and ideas,” &lt;a href="https://mediumworkersunion.org/"&gt;its website reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMlJe4"&gt;Historically, unions have organized around fair pay and benefits. More recently, however, they’ve gone after larger goals, like giving workers a say in business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDDU97"&gt;The news comes a month after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;Google employees and contractors announced the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU), a group also affiliated with CWA. AWU is a solidarity union, meaning it’s not recognized by the NLRB and can’t force Google management to negotiate a contract for its members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef2RnX"&gt;Medium, which hosts both a blogging platform and digital media outlets, sits at the corner of tech and journalism. In recent years, workers at &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed, and Vox &lt;/em&gt;(which includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) have also announced plans to unionize. Now, the movement is growing in the tech industry, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKNP02"&gt;In a section titled “our vision,” the Medium Workers Union says part of its goal is to bake social justice into the product. “Our platform’s mission aligns with the greater purpose of social good, and we invest in mitigating harm in a landscape of tech and media that has historically deprioritized user safety and combating misinformation,” the website reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzlnSa"&gt;The union also said it wants workers to have protections against harassment and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, class, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, body size, and disability. “We hold the company and its leaders accountable to their diversity and inclusion promises, and to maintaining an open door culture for marginalized workers to voice their concerns without fear of retaliation,” the website says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLO5gk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Medium spokesperson wrote: “We’re aware that some employees have started to explore unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. This is an important matter that merits thoughtful consideration, and we are assessing the appropriate next steps.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DFjEA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter plans to label the personal accounts of heads of state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6BA7kEbgKroYAXGR-WRIYvlH7w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805612/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfCb4q"&gt;Beginning next week, Twitter will add labels to the personal accounts of heads of state as it expands its policy on government-affiliated accounts, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/account-labels-phase2.html"&gt;the company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The labels are meant to provide context for users to “have a more informed experience on Twitter,” according to a blog post from Twitter Support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqZcQ3"&gt;This appears to be a change from an earlier position when the company said it &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-labels-for-government-and-state-affiliated-media-accounts.html"&gt;would not label the personal accounts&lt;/a&gt; of heads of state since such accounts already have “widespread name recognition, media attention, and public awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K9k332"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To continue to help you identify governmental officials and institutions on Twitter, we’re expanding our policy to label these accounts in more countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next week, you’ll start to see new profile labels on government accounts in 16 other countries.&lt;a href="https://t.co/RNyrznKQuL"&gt;https://t.co/RNyrznKQuL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/poK4vIa5xZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/poK4vIa5xZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1359941657215475712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WXHXvB"&gt;Twitter said it will also update the text in its labels to add more specificity and will apply additional labels to state-affiliated media accounts in the coming months. The company has stopped amplifying tweets from accounts where a government “exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.” That doesn’t include news outlets that receive government funding but which have editorial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C48d3"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357287/twitter-government-officials-state-affiliated-media-labels-algorithm"&gt;Twitter began applying labels&lt;/a&gt; to government officials’ accounts to more clearly identify them for users. It started with government officials in China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US, and is adding Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates beginning on February 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG6L3z"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Thursday about whether it would apply additional protections to personal accounts of heads of state, but such protections apparently do exist. In July, the accounts of dozens of companies and high-profile individuals were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;compromised during a massive breach&lt;/a&gt; that was part of a bitcoin-promoting scam, but the (now-banned) account of then-President Trump was unaffected. It turned out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam"&gt;Trump’s account enjoyed additional protections&lt;/a&gt; after “past incidents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdDlGz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Trump was permanently banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January for inciting the deadly attack on the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game of Thrones showrunners are producing a Netflix adaptation of The Overstory with Hugh Jackman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q7hTQUxRpg-hJxpri1y0PkJ0rzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805581/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvA65S"&gt;David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators and showrunners of HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, have a new project in the works with Netflix that will see the duo team up with actor Hugh Jackman to executive produce an adaptation of the 2018 novel &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;. The novel, from author Richard Powers, is a work of environmental fiction centered on the lives of a group of individuals and how their experiences relate to a distinct set of trees and the movement to preserve and protect nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtgCdE"&gt;Benioff and Weiss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20761099/game-of-thrones-david-benioff-db-weiss-netflix-deal-200-million-disney-stars"&gt;inked a deal with Netflix in 2019&lt;/a&gt; worth a reported $250 million to bring new shows to the platform. &lt;em&gt;The Overstory &lt;/em&gt;adaptation will be the duo’s third after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410210/netflix-the-three-body-problem-benioff-weiss-adapation"&gt;adaptation of Liu Cixin’s sci-fi trilogy The Remembrance of Earth’s Past&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps better known by its first entry, &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/holland-taylor-sandra-oh-jay-duplass-netflix-dramedy-series-the-chair-1234673561/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new six-part series from showrunner Amanda Peet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b5ZCke"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Overstory is being developed as a series by David Benioff &amp;amp; D.B. Weiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Powers’ novel is a sweeping work of activism and resistance about a magnificently inventive world that a handful of people learn how to see and are drawn into &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wn0VTlFWcU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wn0VTlFWcU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Queue (@netflixqueue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixqueue/status/1359902772443836417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB81JI"&gt;Jackman is reportedly a fan of the novel, as is Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-of-thrones-creators-set-third-netflix-show-the-overstory?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The book won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and Netflix describes the novel as “a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of the natural world” in its announcement post. “It tells the story of a world alongside ours that is vast, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive and almost invisible to us,” the announcement goes on to say. “A handful of disparate people learn how to see that world and are drawn into its unfolding catastrophe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-68" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are down to $180 at Amazon and Walmart</title>

  &lt;p id="XWNZQd"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, Apple’s AirPods Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;are possibly the best option out there&lt;/a&gt;. If you have been holding off on buying the AirPods Pro, hoping for a significant price drop, your time has come: Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds are just $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now. That’s $69 off the usual $249 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLpNMN"&gt;While this is not the lowest price we have seen these earbuds go for, the AirPods Pro rarely get marked down to anything lower than $190, making this an exceptional deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm8acq"&gt;Among other advantages, the AirPods Pro offer a customizable fit that includes three different silicone ear tip sizes, making it easier for them to fit in your ears. The standard AirPods come with a “one size fits most” design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04LGOU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBZb6"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of AirPods but aren’t interested in the Pro model, Amazon currently has one of the better deals on the regular AirPods. For $110, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a second-generation pair with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied at checkout). For $50 more, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair that includes a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
