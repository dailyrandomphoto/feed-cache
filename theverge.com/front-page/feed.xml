    <title>HP says it will slash emissions — and make sure its suppliers do, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP Inc Announces It Will Cut 9,000 Jobs Over 3 Years In Restructuring Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hNwDMr0WF5JORTkSkakDDLwR7jY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69155310/1179053339.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uiUW6T"&gt;HP pledged to slash its still-growing greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade, compared to 2019 levels. It plans to reach “net zero” emissions by 2040, meaning that it won’t release more climate pollution than it can draw down from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCw9Ps"&gt;Those targets fall in line with &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;what scientists have found&lt;/a&gt; is necessary globally to stave off the worst effects of climate change. It also follows climate commitments made recently by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20960357/dell-greener-computers-recycling-climate-change-pledge"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has a faster-approaching deadline of achieving net zero emissions by 2030. Dell pledged in 2019 to cut planet-heating pollution from its operations and electricity use in half this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rxmGzV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s overall carbon footprint grew by 5 percent in 2019 &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLIpx7"&gt;HP’s plan to reduce emissions is on a shorter timeline than Dell’s. Dell plans to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, ten years later than HP. And unlike Dell, HP also pledged to halve emissions for which it’s indirectly responsible this decade. That includes pollution from supply chains and from the use of its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egkrSR"&gt;Environmental advocates are pushing companies to grapple with indirect emissions because they typically make up the biggest share of a company’s overall carbon footprint. That’s the case for HP, whose pollution has grown in this area for the past few years even as its other emissions have fallen. As business grew, the company’s overall carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fh20195.www2.hp.com%2Fv2%2Fgetpdf.aspx%2Fc06601778.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22392453%2Fhp-sustainability-climate-change-commitments" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grew by 5 percent in 2019&lt;/a&gt; compared to the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iWHD9X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HP says it will push suppliers to make similar CO2 pollution reductions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ7ET1"&gt;HP plans to focus on using more renewable energy while making its products more energy efficient. It also says it will turn to electric vehicles and alternative fuels to ship products, and it will push its suppliers to make similar CO2 pollution reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="degZbo"&gt;Beyond addressing climate change, HP also announced initiatives to protect forests and reduce waste. By the end of the decade, it says that 75 percent of its total annual product and packaging content will be made with recycled, reused, or renewable materials. Last year, the company achieved its goal of sourcing 99 percent of materials for its paper products from recycled sources or &lt;a href="https://us.fsc.org/en-us/certification#:~:text=FSC%20certification%20ensures%20that%20products,FSC%20US%20National%20Standard%20(v1."&gt;responsibly managed forests&lt;/a&gt;. Now it wants to make up for deforestation caused by other companies by upping its investments in restoring forests. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitness-focused HTC Vive Air VR headset revealed in new leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dYOmfooENjfMIDFQv-hX8Il_lpo=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69155135/htc_vive_air_leak_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eD2d8x"&gt;Images of an upcoming fitness-focused virtual reality headset from HTC, dubbed the Vive Air, have leaked online. Details about the product were published by the &lt;a href="https://ifworlddesignguide.com/entry/309526-vive-air-vr-headset"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World Design Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(which we spotted &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-air-wireless-headset-leaks-on-design-award-site-114042580.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) as part of its annual awards. It seems likely the product will be unveiled officially at HTC’s upcoming ViveCon 2021 on May 11th and 12th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGJTpp"&gt;The Vive Air is “specially designed for virtual fitness” and “optimized for high intensity with long use,” says the copy on the &lt;em&gt;World Design Guide&lt;/em&gt;’s website. The headset is built from fast-drying knitted fabrics inspired by sports shoes, which are supposed to be lightweight and breathable. A quick-release design allows these “ergonomic soft components” to be removed for washing. The site says the Vive Air will launch sometime in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OmOYVH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10455999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Spez1s"&gt;It certainly seems like a well-positioned product as VR is becoming increasingly popular for fitness activities during global lockdown. Just this month, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;interviewed the creator&lt;/a&gt; of popular VR workout app Supernatural who claimed that “fitness is the killer use case for VR” and that workout software “will be the first driving force of mass adoption [of virtual reality] through a normal consumer audience.” Creating a comfortable, lightweight headset that doesn’t stink of sweat after a week or two seems like a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4u0Q2"&gt;Can a sports-focused VR headset prove a hit for HTC, though? The company’s original Vive headset helped create the most recent iteration of the VR market when it launched in 2016, but the firm’s hardware has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907998/vive-cosmos-vr-headset-review-price-specs-features-test"&gt;since been overtaken&lt;/a&gt; by competitors like Oculus. Narrowing down on a specific (and growing) use case could be a smart way forward for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Spring Loaded 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k56xFYkqYklvP154YETbB7r5PI=/0x0:1770x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154983/appleinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7b3MP"&gt;Whenever Apple decides to schedule an event, you know there are going to be some interesting products introduced, with at least one major device taking center stage and perhaps one or two surprise entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmxQwt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Current rumors&lt;/a&gt; have Apple introducing 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, the latter with Apple’s first Mini LED display. There may also be a new Apple Pencil stylus to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gb8Fz"&gt;What else? We could see Apple’s long-awaited AirTags, device trackers that are set to go up against Tile, the current leader in that particular market. There is the possibility of a new iPod Mini, a third-generation version of the AirPods, a new model of the Apple TV (which was released in 2017), and the official release of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ksWii"&gt;Anything more? Well, that’s always a possibility. Be here at 1PM ET and find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIVuhB"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “SPRING LOADED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You’ll have to tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, April 20th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE APPLE EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;As always, Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22385720%2Fapple-event-watch-live-stream-date-start-time-spring-loaded" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M"&gt;streaming on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded up at the top, so feel free to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15-inch review: redemption</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s newest Surface Laptop brings better battery life and a better chip&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BOIcbE"&gt;On paper, the Surface Laptop 4 is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923620/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-15-inch-review-windows-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Surface Laptop 3&lt;/a&gt; with better chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5zBgK"&gt;In look and feel, very little has changed from the last generation. Sure, there are differences here and there: the Laptop 4 is ever-so-slightly thinner, and there’s a new “Ice Blue” color option. But you get the same 3:2 touchscreen, the same port selection, and the same design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qw8qk"&gt;The big changes are on the inside. You can configure both the 13.5-inch and 15-inch Surface Laptop models with either Intel’s 11th-Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 processors. Microsoft promised that these improvements would deliver significantly better performance and battery life than the previous Surface generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXpz75"&gt;So this review will largely focus on the new system’s performance. But my priority wasn’t to compare the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 that we received to its predecessor. For one, the Laptop 3 set a low performance bar — it had mediocre battery life, and couldn’t even play a 4K 60FPS video without stuttering, so even a competent budget laptop would blow that out of the water. But more importantly, there’s another company out there that recently made a huge chip upgrade to its flagship models, which has left most other 2020 chip upgrades in the dust: Apple, with its Arm-based M1. So my big question when looking at AMD’s new Ryzen 7 Surface Edition (also known as the AMD Ryzen 7 4980U Microsoft Surface Edition because of course it is) is: Does it beat Apple’s M1? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbtP0q"&gt;The answer is no. For the most part, it’s still not quite as good. But that may not matter to Surface Laptop 4 buyers — at least, not yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VCW5EQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 13.5-inch review: have a normal one ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932406/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-13-5-inch-review-test-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 15-inch review: it’s a bigger Surface Laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923620/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-15-inch-review-windows-test-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MXFAKA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10455259"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9TXvb"&gt;First, a quick tour of the Ryzen 7 Surface Edition. This chip isn’t AMD’s top gun; it’s part of the Ryzen 4000 generation, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt; has been out for a few months now. It’s a bit disappointing to see that the Surface is still using the older Ryzen chips, since much of the new generation is based on a new architecture (Zen 3, to the 4000 series’s Zen 2) that has delivered performance gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z0FAAP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s disappointing to see that the Surface is still using older Ryzen chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BgNSEs"&gt;Of course, that doesn’t make the Ryzen 7 4980U a bad chip. Ryzen 4000 chips outperform Intel’s 10th Gen Comet Lake processors across the board. The 4980U in particular has eight cores, and AMD’s excellent Radeon integrated graphics. Note that the M1 also has eight cores, but those cores aren’t created equal. An easy way to think of it is that AMD’s chip has eight all-around-pretty-good cores, while Apple’s chip has four high-performance cores and four weaker cores. You’ll see that difference reflected in our benchmark results later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXR1Wh"&gt;In addition to that processor, the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 I reviewed comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It costs &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-4%2F946627FB12T1%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D79838A%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt;. The most comparable M1 MacBook Pro is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F13-inch-space-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22392778%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not looking to spend that much, you can get the 15-inch Laptop 4 for as low as $1,299 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which puts it neck-in-neck with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F13-inch-space-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22392778%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry-level MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but with a bigger screen. The 13.5-inch Laptop 4 is priced more closely to the fanless &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22392778%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, starting at $999 for a Ryzen 5 4680U, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. Then, there are the Intel models. You can get a 13.5-inch system with a Core i5 starting at $1,299 (also with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage), and a 15-inch system with a Core i7 starting at $1,799 (16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage). It’s all quite confusing, so I recommend visiting Microsoft’s site for yourself to mix and match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop 4 15-inch seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JJpWTgsxAQaEUzKsbaT80APyQdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456007/mchin_20190710_4532_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13.5-inch model comes in Platinum, Ice Blue Alcantara, Matte Black, and Sandstone. The 15-incher comes in Platinum and Matte Black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="edr1DY"&gt;To see how our test system stacks up, I ran various synthetic benchmarks as well as a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video export in Premiere Pro. See the results below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BOyS48"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10455270"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kLzNMe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a huge improvement over the Surface Laptop 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w3KlK7"&gt;Right off the bat, this system is a huge improvement over the Surface Laptop 3. It took 16 minutes and 33 seconds on the video export, where its predecessor took over three hours. (16:33 is a slower time than we’ve seen from many Intel models, but that’s expected since AMD chips don’t support Intel’s Quick Sync.) The Laptop 4 also beats multi-core synthetic results we’ve seen from Intel’s top Tiger Lake chips in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368806/msi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7"&gt;MSI Prestige 14 Evo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310002/vaio-z-2021-laptop-review"&gt;Vaio Z&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the 16-inch &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Just-Arrived-Apple-MacBook-Pro-16-with-Core-i9-Radeon-Pro-5500M.443889.0.html"&gt;Intel-based MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 half open on a picnic table, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZh7Rt7nXxvYIukHN7-ujQKxtBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456005/mchin_20190710_4532_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel models max out at a quad-core Core i7-1185G7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAgZMp"&gt;But the more interesting comparison is to the M1 machines. The Surface Laptop 4 solidly beats both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; on Cinebench R23 Multi, and that task alone — it lost to both machines on every other test we ran, including all three Geekbench tests, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32441"&gt;Puget for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=27129"&gt;Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt; benchmark, and the Premiere Pro export. That may seem confusing but (again) it makes sense when you think about the architecture of both chips — the Ryzen chip does better on the task where it can show off all eight of its powerful cores. That indicates that you’ll do well with the Surface Book if you’re running heavy multicore workloads, where you’re more suited to the M1 if you’re primarily doing pretty much anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="RhNajp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10455283"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFkE8w"&gt;Of course, that’s far from the whole story. The reality is that most people who want a 15-inch screen probably don’t care if there’s a better-performing 13-inch machine floating around. And the MacBook that’s comparable in size — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; — is significantly more expensive than the Surface Laptop 4, and comes with older Intel chips. So why am I comparing this device to M1 systems, you may ask? Really, I’m benching this laptop against an imaginary 16-inch M1 MacBook Pro, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;rumor has it&lt;/a&gt;) will launch sometime in the third quarter of this year. Given the results I’m seeing here, the release of a machine like that would make the Surface Laptop 4 a tougher purchase to justify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MllOLM"&gt;That said, there are two big advantages the Ryzen-powered Surface Laptop 4 could very well have over a 16-inch M1 MacBook. The first is battery life. I got an average of 10 hours and 52 minutes using this device as my primary driver, which is some of the best battery life I’ve ever seen from a 15-inch laptop, and one of the best results I’ve seen from a laptop this year. That beats both of the M1 MacBooks, and destroys the 16-inch Intel MacBook as well. If there’s an area where Microsoft really makes its case, it’s here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE1pga"&gt;The Laptop 4 also knocks cooling out of the park. The Laptop 4’s fans did a really excellent job cooling the system. Throughout my fairly standard load of office multitasking (including around a dozen Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and the like), the chassis remained downright cold. During the more intense tests I ran, the CPU remained steadily in the mid-70s (Celsius) with occasional spikes up to the mid-80s — jumps up to 90 were rare. I was able to run our 4K video export several times in a row without any negative impact on results, and I didn’t see a huge dip in Cinebench results over a 30-minute loop either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop 4 15-inch open on a picnic table with a pink apartment building in the background. The screen displays sand dunes with a blue sky." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzsU1BDYLgFE0cnffasVMYGhqrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456006/mchin_20190710_4532_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen maxed out at 370 nits — a bit dim for outdoor use, as you can see here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GZnRho"&gt;If you’re a fan of the 15-inch Surface Laptop’s design, you’ll be happy to know it hasn’t changed much. One of the big advantages of this device is how thin and light it is, at just 0.58 inches thick and 3.4 pounds. For context, it’s almost a pound lighter than the 16-inch MacBook Pro, and over half a pound lighter than the lightest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. It’s actually only a bit heavier than the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP824?locale=en_US"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCVDCP"&gt;With that said, those who aren’t diehard Surface fans may find the Laptop 4’s design a tad dated. In particular, the bezels around the 3:2 screen are quite chunky. That makes sense on a convertible device like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt;, which you need to be able to hold as a tablet, but doesn’t fit as well on a clamshell. If you put the Laptop 4 next to any member of the XPS line, you’ll see how much sleeker and more modern the latter looks. That doesn’t mean the Laptop 4 is ugly; it’s just falling further behind other Windows laptops each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccLnPM"&gt;The port selection is also the same, which is good news and bad news. The Laptop 4 retains a USB-A port, which I stubbornly believe is still a necessity for modern laptops (looking at you, Apple and Dell). But there is just one, and neither the Intel or AMD model supports Thunderbolt on their lone USB-C ports, which is disappointing on a laptop at this price. The Surface Laptop could certainly do with more port options, even if it’s competitive with what Apple and Dell are offering in terms of numbers. (In addition to the USB-A and USB-C, you get a headphone jack and Microsoft’s proprietary charging port.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaCPUc"&gt;The Windows Hello webcam is fine, delivering a serviceable picture, and the dual far-field microphones had no trouble picking up my voice. The speakers, which now support Dolby Atmos 9, sound quite clear, with good volume and bass and percussion that are audible (though not booming). Despite having Atmos speakers, our Laptop 4 unit didn’t come preloaded with Dolby Atmos software or anything similar to tune the audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop 4 15-inch lid from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7R0mEHkxKwdbH3C_qG6bziVYUA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456008/mchin_20190710_4532_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All 15-inch models have an aluminum body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ijIHcV"&gt;My least favorite part of this laptop is the keyboard. It’s just a bit flat and mushy for my taste. I respect that some people prefer wider, flatter keycaps, of course. But I would take an XPS 15, MacBook, or Surface Book keyboard over this one — it’s just not quite as snappy or satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAvBKk"&gt;Overall, it’s tough to identify a true competitor to the 15-inch Surface Laptop 4. Put it next to a Windows workstation like the $1,200 &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9500-laptop/xn9500cto200s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry-level Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; and the Surface wins on power, battery life, and weight. It’s a good purchase for someone who wants an excellent combination of efficiency and multicore performance in a 15-inch chassis, but doesn’t need the grunt of a discrete GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop 4 15-inch keyboard from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EI-pty1-xd4fr2Qvbal1HtZ-x8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456009/mchin_20190710_4532_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is backlit and has 1.3 mm of travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47YZoP"&gt;But that window of opportunity may be closing, because there’s very likely a larger M1 MacBook Pro on the way. I think there’s a good argument that people in the group described above (who don’t need a device right this second) should sit back and wait to see what Apple does in the next few months before committing to Microsoft’s machine, provided they don’t have a hard preference for operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jdFN2G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a pretty damn good buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbkp6w"&gt;On the other hand, even if the larger MacBook Pro is spectacular, there are some advantages the Laptop 4 will certainly retain (it runs Windows, and it’s built like a Surface Laptop) and some it will probably retain (it’ll likely be lighter than the MacBook Pro 16). And, of course, plenty of people need a laptop right now. In today’s market, among today’s 15-inch laptops, the Surface Laptop 4 is a pretty damn good buy. Microsoft didn’t change much about the outside — but on the inside, it really pulled through. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luigi is joining Lego’s interactive Mario sets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-b2Qk8dXPHkAUHgUgf0XQRRttCs=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154934/oWpI9vyg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="te1MJl"&gt;Luigi — everyone’s favorite also-ran brother of the most famous mushroom-stomping plumber — is joining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;Lego’s interactive Super Mario collection of sets&lt;/a&gt; in a new starter kit (creatively titled the LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Luigi Starter Course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE4UVv"&gt;The new Luigi figure is technologically similar to the Mario one, with a built-in display that animates his eyes, mouth, and a main screen on his chest and a sensor on the bottom that’s used to scan barcodes and brick colors. The main differences are cosmetic here — Luigi looks different, and features different sound effects, voice lines, and character interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Fp0Du"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tao6Nnwwa5w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The new Luigi character is also compatible with all the previous sets, should players want to explore their old courses from a fresh perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFZGiN"&gt;The Luigi Starter course is set to launch on August 1st for $59.99, the same price as the Mario Starter course set. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fadventures-with-luigi-starter-course-71387%3Ficmp%3DLP-SHH-Tall-Mario_Hero_Tall_Luigi-TH-NO-CL7IET0VZ1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393486%2Fluigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt; from the Lego website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is opening a hair salon in London to trial new technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJdxPZeWYJ15qz1WO4UATeO5m5g=/0x45:812x586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154932/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91DqhW"&gt;Amazon’s latest bricks-and-mortar experiment is, unexpectedly, a hair salon. The company is opening its &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/introducing-amazon-salon"&gt;Amazon Salon&lt;/a&gt; in London’s East End Spitalfields area, where it says it will trial “the latest industry technology.” This includes an augmented reality app that lets customers see what different hair styles and colors look like on them before they decide on a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8uDqZ"&gt;Unlike the company’s cashierless Go grocery stores (which expanded to London &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312970/amazon-fresh-cashier-less-store-uk-go-grocery-london"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon Salon does not seem to be a beachhead for an industry invasion. “This will be an experiential venue where we showcase new products and technology, and there are no current plans to open any other Amazon Salon locations,” said the company in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDgIIT"&gt;Instead, it looks more like a modest marketing stunt meant to signal the company’s ambitions in the fashion and beauty sectors generally. These have been sectors where Amazon has struggled to make in-roads against specialist stores. The arrival of the Amazon Salon in London follows the company’s launch of its &lt;a href="https://business.amazon.co.uk/en/find-solutions/simplify-buying/selection/pro-beauty"&gt;Amazon Professional Beauty Store&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, an online storefront that sells wholesale spa and salon products to businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wGRI5K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10455952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6MnWY"&gt;Amazon Salon will occupy more than 1,500 square feet of space across two floors at a location in Brushfield Street. As well as playing around with AR haircut apps (and getting an actual haircut), visitors will be able to test new “point-and-learn” technology” which allows them to “simply point at the product they are interested in on a display shelf” to bring up more information and purchasing options on a nearby display. That includes QR codes to buy specific items. It sounds pretty underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XBvNn"&gt;Anyone wanting to get an Amazon-brand trim will have to wait, though. The Amazon Salon will initially only be open to Amazon employees with the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt; allowed entry some time “in the coming weeks.” When you go, be sure to ask for the Jeff Bezos “slaphead special.” We hear it’s very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony launches ‘Silent White’ WH-1000XM4 headphones because the black void of space is too loud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWh0VBSg9YDXgIYqXUFHaYuq7X0=/0x1:2393x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154914/WH_1000XM4_SilentWhite_Sub_B_gradation_low_for_wide_angle_8000x4262_Large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bmdmt2"&gt;Picture the scene. It’s summer, lockdowns are easing, and you’re ready to venture back out into the world. You’re feeling brave after a year stuck inside, brave enough that you’ve picked out an all-white outfit. You read up on how to make the color work in the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.fr/fashion/article/fashion-trends-25-ways-to-wear-white-spring-summer-season"&gt;likes of &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-wear-all-white-everything"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but suddenly, disaster strikes. You notice something. “&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;top rated wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;!” you exclaim to no-one in particular, “they’re only available in black, &lt;a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x8gW79x-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, or this &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/image/b46f52146929c0b90f207296acd5a224?fmt=png-alpha&amp;amp;wid=720"&gt;weird dork-ass beige&lt;/a&gt;?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vbEkQ"&gt;It’s ok, don’t fret. &lt;a href="https://presscentre.sony.eu/pressreleases/sony-launches-new-limited-edition-wh-1000xm4-silent-white-3091756"&gt;Sony is releasing a limited edition &lt;/a&gt;of the WH-1000XM4 headphones in all white. Better still, it’s real white, not that orthopedic brown Sony’s being trying to pass off as “silver” all these years. Sony promises these “Silent White” headphones will be “even more stain-resistant,” which will hopefully help keep them looking pristine for at least a little while. Unfortunately they’re limited edition, and will only be available while stock lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BG1Fpc1zfdxiSD8U0vjeM2nvz4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456595/WH_1000XM4_White_with_case2_Large.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MfLOGV"&gt;Internally these are the same as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;excellent WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt; the company released last year. That means you’re getting excellent audio quality, noise cancellation, and mic performance, and the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCWiqu"&gt;The white headphones will be available in Europe from May for €430/£400, but there’s no sign of the color on &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4"&gt;Sony’s US site&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. We’ve contacted the company to ask about US availability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now the iPad Pro has to live up to the MacBook Air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieBVdecSxfGIePzeEQUaafZbPbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154867/vpavic_042018_3979_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jyIXlW"&gt;Today, we’re expecting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;grab bag of new products from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, headlined by new iPad Pros. Given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;relatively minor spec bumps&lt;/a&gt; that we got on last year’s iPad Pros, this time around we’re hoping for a more substantial update. In some ways, it seems likely that Apple will deliver, at least with the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXIPct"&gt;I’m sure the specs will be impressive. But after the release of the first MacBooks with Apple’s own M1 ARM-based silicon, there’s a strange inversion happening. Before, we’d look at a MacBook and wonder why it can’t have the power and battery life of an iPad. Now, I think more and more people are going to join me in looking at the iPad and wondering why it can’t have the flexibility and power of a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTUUhc"&gt;In short, Apple’s silicon didn’t just catch the Mac up to the iPad, it catapulted the Mac beyond the iPad. The M1 MacBook Air is fast, responsive, has no fan, runs any Mac app I throw at it (including Intel apps) very quickly, and even can run some iPad apps (though that experiment isn’t going super well). It is easily the best general-purpose laptop I’ve used in half a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-404" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qESXR"&gt;That big of a leap can’t help but recast the iPad’s development over the years. As just one data point, I’ve used both iPad Pros and M1-based MacBooks as my daily work computer and the MacBook Air has better battery life. An iPad can last for days and days if you just use it for tablet tasks, but log in to all your stuff and run it all day like you do your laptop and it’ll conk out a few hours short of the MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofl5N7"&gt;From one perspective, I get that it’s silly to just one-to-one compare the iPad and Mac. The iPad is more flexible in its hardware: you can sit on the couch with it, you can use a stylus with it, attach a keyboard, and — get this — touch the screen. When I speak to Apple executives, they express little of the Mac vs iPad angst I see online (and feel myself). Nobody’s actually confused between these two devices, they argue, and I believe it. One of my core beliefs about consumer technology is that consumers are savvier and smarter than they usually get credit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH5OBQ"&gt;That savvy cuts both ways, though. Because from the other perspective, everybody is capable of just looking at each computer’s capabilities and seeing that the Mac can just do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not quite true that the iPad’s functionality is merely a subset of the Mac’s, but in the Venn diagram of the two the iPad-only part of the circle isn’t very big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvAvdD"&gt;Another way of looking at it is this: it used to be that you would go for the iPad because the MacBook was just fundamentally worse at a few things like speed and battery life. Now that we have MacBooks with Apple Silicon, that list is significantly shorter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtA7L6"&gt;Can the iPad Pro jump back ahead through purely hardware specs? It’d be tough. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;Mark Gurman at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad Pro is supposed to get an “updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the latest MacBook Air.” There are significant differences between how Apple puts together iOS chips and MacBook chips, but let’s just assume it’s easy to compare and the iPad gets faster. So what? Apple has the enviable problem right now of having computers that are more than fast enough for the vast majority of people. I don’t know anybody who’s actually complaining about the iPad Pro’s speed or graphical capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiFoCg"&gt;New cameras? Sure. LIDAR? I remain unconvinced it’s a must-have feature for anybody. The one thing that might matter is the rumored fancy, new Mini LED screen technology on the larger iPad Pro. That will make it look more like a high-end TV, with brighter brights and blacker-blacks. One of the best things to do on an iPad is watch video, and so it might convince some people to upgrade just for the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcJI5p"&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review of the M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, I called it a “triumph” and was seriously considering giving it a perfect score until I saw how dumpy the webcam still is. That’s one place where the iPad has a much better spec: the iPad Pro’s front facing camera is excellent. It’s also in the wrong place, on the side when you use it horizontally instead of on the top. That’s the iPad Pro in a microcosm: stupefyingly good hardware with some stupid limitations in how Apple expects it to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WdmW7j"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPadOS review: sounds like a computer to me|73038" data-volume-uuid="74dee35c2" data-volume-id="73038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-404" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkDgAY"&gt;The story with the iPad — and especially the iPad Pro — since before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18103515/ipad-pro-replace-your-computer-ad-apple"&gt;2018 “What’s a computer” TV ad&lt;/a&gt; has been the same. Can its iOS-based software be opened up and extended enough to allow both developers and users to get it to do the things they want. Apple made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20898883/ipados-review-13-apple-features-multitasking-sidecar-browser-bugs-computer"&gt;huge step in that direction with iPadOS in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a long way to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irArMx"&gt;Today’s iPad Pros are likely to be amazing feats of technology, but the really important iPad announcement will come this summer at WWDC, when Apple will unveil its plans for iPadOS. Right now I use the iPad Pro every day, but mostly as a Sidecar display for my MacBook. It’s just much more useful as a Mac screen than it is as an iPad screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvOPiu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoCIfv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo is adding support for users to buy, store, and sell cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_BALD5_nFLqjGNAq2Oafvi0gUU=/1x0:1840x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154747/Crypto_on_Venmo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gfL0WM"&gt;Venmo is releasing a feature that will allow users the option to store, buy, and sell popular cryptocurrencies, PayPal announced on Tuesday. Similar to PayPal, Venmo will support four different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. PayPal had said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that Venmo would get support for cryptocurrencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmttZG"&gt;You can get started with as little as $1, and transactions are managed from the app. Venmo said in a press release that it will begin rolling out the feature to some users today, and tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it anticipates that “most customers” will have access to cryptocurrencies in the app by the end of May. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KgL9q3m_iAUMs155lvTOQIiMGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455653/image001__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All cryptocurrency transactions will be managed directly from the Venmo app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uuSgt4"&gt;Venmo’s support for cryptocurrencies could encourage more people to invest in them. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F02%2F04%2Fpaypal-holdings-pypl-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcr%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22392274%2Fvenmo-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-hold-bitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PayPal reported in its Q4 earnings reporter that Venmo had 70 million users&lt;/a&gt;; given the app operates like a social network, users may find cryptocurrency more approachable if they can see their friends buying and selling right inside Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyBbs2"&gt;Venmo is the latest payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency. PayPal allowed users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency from the main PayPal app &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency?sf130849673=1"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; and added the ability for US users to make purchases with cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357246/paypal-buy-with-bitcoin-litecoin-ethereum-crypto-checkout"&gt;in late March&lt;/a&gt;. And Venmo and PayPal competitor Square launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17689156/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-support-to-all-50-us-states"&gt;support for Bitcoin in its Cash App in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new wireless keyboard is designed for DeX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rC91Ls71_EJu-Ihek4J_AFWOXLQ=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154735/levant_feature_enter_into_dex_for_productivity_421565506.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard features a DeX shortcut on the top right of the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6RtvJ"&gt;Samsung has quietly announced a new wireless keyboard, the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/levant/mobile-accessories/samsung-smart-keyboard-trio-500-black-ej-b3400ubegww/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Keyboard Trio 500&lt;/a&gt;. According to a listing on Samsung’s store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1383730984495894532"&gt;spotted by Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it’s a compact wireless keyboard with a very similar design to the likes of Apple’s Magic Keyboard, but with an interesting Samsung twist — a DeX shortcut to use the desktop-style interface on compatible Samsung devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFboC3"&gt;DeX has been around since launching on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15495036/samsung-dex-station-galaxy-s8-review-desktop-dock"&gt;Galaxy S8 back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and allows you to access select Samsung phone or tablet’s apps in a windowed-interface similar to a desktop computer. But despite receiving new features and updates with subsequent phone releases, it’s yet to become the true desktop replacement Samsung initially pitched it as. Giving it an eye-catching button probably won’t change that, but it could still work as a little advertisement to use the feature, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"&gt;Netflix’s ubiquitous TV remote buttons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExJA6ElX3bUioLLx5jmTK1KlxlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456562/levant_feature_pair_multiple_devices___switch_with_a_click_421565518.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard can be paired with up to three devices, and switch between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecr1SX"&gt;Beyond DeX, the Smart Keyboard Trio 500 has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve. There are customizable shortcut buttons to open your commonly used apps (though this is only compatible with Samsung devices running One UI 3.1 from march 2021 or later). The keyboard can also be paired with up to three devices, and switch between them using shortcut keys. It draws power from AAA batteries, which suggests it’s not rechargeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCzPPo"&gt;Samsung hasn’t listed a price or release date on its page for the Smart Keyboard Trio 500, but with an Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382512/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-april-28th-event-most-powerful-device-book-pro"&gt;coming up on April 28th&lt;/a&gt; we could get an official unveiling soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prnvaS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABUR4l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
