    <title>LG’s Mini LED TVs to release in the US starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqTZTekFcsJkJVlsFbhVgsF5iRM=/0x108:1863x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69522668/LG_8K_QNED_Mini_LED_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Mini LED use an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a backlight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98Wumc"&gt;LG’s new range of Mini LED TVs, which it’s branding “QNED,” are releasing worldwide starting next month, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/now-rolling-out-worldwide-lg-qned-mini-led-tv-sets-new-standard-for-lcd-picture-quality/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup consists of three sets, the 8K QNED99 and QNED95, and the 4K QNED90, ranging in size from 65- to 86-inches. LG says the TVs will launch first in North America, with additional regions following “in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyb1U3"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new kind of display technology which uses an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a screen’s backlight. Because there are so many (up to 30,000 in the case of the 86-inch QNED99), they can create a sharper contrast between light and dark areas of an image. LG says the technology, which has previously been used on some TVs from TCL as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, allows for “10 times better contrast ratio” than normal LCD TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvSRJb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not to be confused with MicroLED&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFUqy9"&gt;LG is marketing Mini LED as a “giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality,” but it’s not quite at the level of an OLED TV, where its the individual pixels themselves that are illuminating to create an image (with Mini LED, the LEDs are still shining through an LCD layer). Mini LED should not be confused with Samsung’s outrageously expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168793/samsungs-75-inch-microled-4k-tv-pitcure-quality-ces-2019"&gt;MicroLED&lt;/a&gt; technology, which also uses an array of tiny LEDs but without the need for an LCD layer at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpaZpo"&gt;We’ve reached out to LG to clarify pricing for its full lineup of QNED TVs (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fqned-mini-led-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22556962%2Flg-mini-led-qned-tvs-release-date-usa-july" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s US site&lt;/a&gt; still lists them as “coming soon”) but based on a previous report &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612506923"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they’re unlikely to come cheap. The 8K QNED99 will reportedly start at $5,000 for the 75-inch model, rising to $8,000 for the 86-inch version, while the 4K QNED90 will reportedly cost up to $4,000 for the 86-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc9msMcOm5mdjtNGvste1f9dXpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521850/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work model that would require them to return to in-office work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays starting in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLC88B"&gt;In the wake of that announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple employees wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ9e0"&gt;Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiEsmz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom acquires an AI company building real-time translation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7QRoJkPxYdYcfhbcmvgqkEVUSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521666/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwQpF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-kites-gmbh/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring a company known as Kites (short for Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions), which has worked on creating real-time translation and transcription software. Zoom says the acquisition is a move to help it make communicating with people who speak different languages easier, and that it’s looking to add translation capabilities to its video conferencing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCEVrd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kites.ai/"&gt;According to its site&lt;/a&gt;, Kites began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and its technology was originally developed to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-ai-outperforms-humans-speech-recognition.html"&gt;act as in-classroom translation&lt;/a&gt; for students who needed help understanding the English or German their professors were lecturing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1LvAY"&gt;Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;already has real-time transcriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s limited to people who are talking in English. &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Closed-captioning-and-live-transcription"&gt;On a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom also makes it clear that its current live transcription feature may not meet certain accuracy requirements. The company says it’s considering opening a research center in Germany, where the Kites team will be staying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku launches its new originals with a Demi Lovato talk show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVveFmLJbF_BmIAo2D6MtrT-EPY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521611/image002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show will debut July 30th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ7nt2"&gt;The first of a dozen-plus Roku Originals to premiere on the Roku Channel will kick off July 30th with &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt;, a series that had originally been slated for a debut on Quibi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqCtrC"&gt;The show will now launch as Roku’s first “original” to land on the Roku Channel, the platform’s free and ad-supported streaming offering. While originally intended for Quibi, the show will be brand new to audiences when it arrives on the Roku Channel this week. Each episode will be 10 minutes long, feature a celebrity guest, and will cover topics as wide-ranging as UFOs, activism, mental health, gender identity, and police reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Bmr3"&gt;In a statement, Lovato said that they have “never been one to shy away from speaking candidly about things.” The show had previously been announced as &lt;em&gt;Pillow Talk with Demi Lovato&lt;/em&gt; on Quibi, though it never aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkXKmg"&gt;Roku swiped much of Quibi’s library after the service finally folded and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/roku-wisely-rebrands-its-soon-to-debut-quibi-content-as-1846733852"&gt;announced in April&lt;/a&gt; that it would rebrand the haul as Roku Originals. The company further said at the time that some 75 titles would stream on the Roku Channel as free and ad-supported content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t98EJA"&gt;A spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while some of these earlier released shows technically &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/roku-originals-quibi-streaming-one-billion-1234777771/"&gt;made their way&lt;/a&gt; to the Roku Channel in May, others have not been previously released, including this one. That makes &lt;em&gt;The Demi Lovato Show&lt;/em&gt; the first Roku Original debuting on The Roku Channel to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSAq4"&gt;It’s almost as if Quibi never truly left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSOmb1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article used pronouns other than Lovato’s preferred “they/them.” We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators push for equal pay in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKBqYiWvTj3CCD1y2yehE18-pks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521541/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Skp3S8"&gt;WhatsApp’s Spanish language content moderators and customer service representatives are pushing the company for equal pay, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. They say they’ve been excluded from a $2 per hour premium paid to other bilingual contractors. The workers are employed by Accenture, a third-party contracting firm, in Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzDFhj"&gt;“For several years now, Accenture, Facebook, and Whatsapp have denied equal treatment and pay to Spanish language Contingent Workers,” employees say in the letter. “It is an insult for companies like Facebook and Accenture to publicly champion diversity, but yet fail to deliver this to its own workers.” Accenture classifies much of its workforce as contingent, meaning employees are hired as contractors for a specific period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypL2YK"&gt;Workers are demanding that Spanish language contractors receive the $2 premium, as well as backpay for the money they missed out on since they were hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOKoUv"&gt;One worker says they were told they’d need to learn Arabic or Portuguese in order to receive the premium. “I’m already bilingual,” the employee says they responded, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Still, the policy didn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxCgS"&gt;The letter was sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart, and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet. It was posted today on Workplace, Facebook’s internal communications platform. It currently has 89 signatures from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Accenture employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv6SWe"&gt;The letter came after workers pushed for years to have equal pay, according to the internal letter. “Managers and HR reps for Accenture in Austin, Texas have not only ignored the complaints of discrimination for several years now, but they also actively engaged in ensuring this gross injustice go unacknowledged and unaddressed,” the note says. “We say this blatant act of racism and discrimination towards its own essential workers needs to end now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA4V1z"&gt;Facebook content moderators at Accenture’s Austin office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;were asked to come back to the office during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Many said they feared for their safety and felt the company hadn’t adequately addressed their concerns. These employees are often among the lowest paid Facebook workers, and make roughly $18.50 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFSCiv"&gt;Accenture’s Spanish speaking customer service reps say they make as little as $16.50 an hour. “Accenture is the Walmart of the tech industry,” an employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of us have to have two jobs to survive. We get paid $16.50 an hour. That’s not a livable wage in Austin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSsf8P"&gt;Facebook and Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren calls for ‘meticulous’ review of Amazon’s MGM acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Votes On Whether To Advance For The People Act" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JncTv_4zwCDFJMMAkppOOc7QXGE=/0x0:7280x4853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521454/1233598960.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks with reporters on her way to a lunch with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol on June 22, 2021 in Washington, DC.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CMfawC"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren is calling on the Federal Trade Commission for a thorough review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;Amazon’s bid to acquire MGM&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the deal could harm consumers and may have anticompetitive effects in the streaming space and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ilu4t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689724/Letter_to_FTC_re_Amazon_MGM_Deal.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to newly sworn-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;FTC chair Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Warren urged the FTC to specifically and closely examine “the possible anticompetitive effects this deal will have on streaming services and entertainment products in addition to the broader impacts that this transaction may have on workers, small businesses, and competition overall as Amazon—which already dominates numerous markets—accelerates its aggressive monopolistic behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2qoUE"&gt;The FTC is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;reviewing the deal&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger antitrust investigation of Amazon’s business. In her letter to Khan, Warren cited Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act as barring mergers for which the outcome “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” Warren argued that because Amazon’s economic impact is so far-reaching — including but not limited to its services business — a deal that benefits its streaming service Prime Video will only strengthen its position in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VEA380"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Warren argues the deal could hurt consumers and competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70gjaM"&gt;Amazon has a limited footprint in the film industry, but it will have a number of advantages as it enters the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyAco"&gt;The company’s deep pockets put the company in a virtually unmatched position to invest heavily to strengthen its position in the streaming wars. Moreover, Prime Video is offered as one of many services that are technically “perks” rather than individual paid subscriptions. New offerings like exclusive content serve to boost the appeal of Amazon’s paid Prime subscription service, which costs $119 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="him8Uj"&gt;Amazon announced in May that it had reached a deal to acquire the legacy film studio for $8.45 billion. At the time, SVP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios Mike Hopkins said that Amazon was drawn to MGM because of “the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a79exp"&gt;In her letter, however, Warren wrote that the company’s “tactic to operate at a financial loss and use low prices to lure in customers and capture the market has worked before, and the FTC must determine whether this vertical acquisition is truly an entertainment strategy or merely another step towards unfettered monopolization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtuRmh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United’s latest jets will offer Bluetooth for in-flight entertainment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdgPYdElk5WDA3pMxTiWWDoMt8k=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521351/Interior_IFE_Rendering.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: United&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EhOGef"&gt;United Airlines is adding a long-awaited feature to the in-flight entertainment seatback screens of its new Boeing 737 Max 8 jets — support for Bluetooth headphones. The company &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/united-adds-270-boeing-and-airbus-aircraft-to-fleet-largest-order-in-airline-s-history-and-biggest-by-a-single-carrier-in-a-decade-2653586391.html"&gt;is making the upgrade as part of “United Next”&lt;/a&gt;, a new plan to expand and modernize its fleet with what it says are larger, fuel-efficient jets and a more comfortable in-flight experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoXsd"&gt;I haven’t flown in the last two years — for reasons that are hopefully obvious — but the thing that grinds most of my past flying experience to a halt is dealing with the bizarre two-pronged audio jacks airplanes use for inflight audio. Having headphones with a 3.5mm audio jack isn’t hard, but it doesn’t reflect the Bluetooth audio lifestyle, Apple, and plenty of other tech companies have slowly forced me to adopt. I don’t like the wireless audio freak I’ve become, but it happened, which makes United’s upgrades so exciting, as demoed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?s=20"&gt;in the tweets below&lt;/a&gt; from aviation writer Jason Rabinowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0muG5Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The main attraction of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt;'s new interior is the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PanasonicAero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PanasonicAero&lt;/a&gt; seatback IFE system. It finally offers one of the overall most requested passenger items: BLUETOOTH AUDIO. Narrowbody aircraft with these screens will finally make it a reality. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaxEx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PaxEx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tD004G4x7c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tD004G4x7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tD5U5r"&gt;Adding seatback screens made a huge difference in how tolerable flying is, but it’s been held up by lagging audio support that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;has even written a guide&lt;/a&gt; to getting around. And this isn’t a problem unique to United. Other airlines like Delta or JetBlue have been offering seatback screens for years, but have also saddled flyers with analog audio. United just might be one of the first airlines to start the next wave of inflight entertainment improvements (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMAFgy"&gt;However, there’s room for things to go a bit sideways. As part of its upgrades, United’s new 737 Max 8 jets offer 10 or 13-inch inflight entertainment screens on the backs of all seats, which might mean a lot of people trying to connect to Bluetooth at once. That could cause interference, and might also make the process of connecting your headphones more of a chore if you’re having to hunt through multiple devices trying to pair in the same menu. United currently only offers Bluetooth on its Max 8 jets which it says should start flying this summer. The company didn’t share how it plans to address issues with Bluetooth, but said it’s still “studying the technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8X0Iu"&gt;I can’t rightfully claim that Bluetooth is as meaningful a change as more legroom or safer flights, but for an airline industry hoarding cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363675/delta-america-united-airlines-layoffs-cash-covid-19-losses-loans-cares-act"&gt;to make it through the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and looking to entice frequent flyers to earn their miles again, any snazzy new feature can’t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Twitter bug temporarily removed the option to switch to the chronological feed on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_kKNyOL4GiS4IiwA2qBqjxVpuSQ=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521285/IMG_1908.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our friend, for whom we feared the worst today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFD8P2"&gt;Twitter has fixed a bug that left some of us horrified when we opened the site (as is often the case, but for different reasons) — those viewing the social network in a web browser found that they &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/twitter-ditching-latest-chronological-feed-option-on-the-web-still-available-on-ios-for-now/"&gt;no longer had the option to switch between&lt;/a&gt; the algorithmic view and the reverse-chronological one. The algorithmic view, which shows tweets out of order, has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;much maligned since it first appeared&lt;/a&gt;, and the bug on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1409976275440185354?s=20"&gt;had people worried&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter was finally starting to force it on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeIaKm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?s=19"&gt;Twitter’s support account says&lt;/a&gt; that web users should be able to change their timeline order again, and a few of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;have confirmed that the button is back on our timelines. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1409981506055929857?s=20"&gt;Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour&lt;/a&gt; called the toggle’s disappearance a “bug,” reiterating what a company spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cntMqD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweets in chronological order on web has been fixed –– the option to switch your Home timeline view to latest Tweets first was removed for some of you on web. We’ve fixed this and the option should now be available again for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSqZZh"&gt;Adding to the confusion, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;page explaining the timeline&lt;/a&gt; has a bullet saying that switching between top tweets (aka tweets served up algorithmically) and latest tweets is a feature that’s only available on iOS and Android. Some took this to mean that the option was really going away, but it turns out that the line has been there for years, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190203140705/https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;according to the WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible the line is just a holdover from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;when the “sparkle” button was first introduced&lt;/a&gt;, because it conflicts with information that shows up later in the article: Twitter includes instructions on how to change your timeline order for the web at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CKdSQmJDV6InO9pm2Qg1Fc1BuQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689668/Screen_Shot_2021_06_29_at_2.39.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline" target="_blank"&gt;Instructions: Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s instructions for changing your timeline direction on web, Android, and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ogjqta"&gt;If Twitter has a plan for doing away with the option to view a chronological timeline, it doesn’t seem like it’ll be carrying it out today. For some, that news may come as a mixed bag — maybe being forced to use an algorithmic timeline was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/1409967220650692609?s=20"&gt;the best way to kick a bad habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYXW7N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Extremely glad that Twitter removed the "Latest Tweets" option and is forcing everyone to use their algorithm because now I will spend way less time on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1409949383362289669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Hasan Piker on the problem with YouTube debate culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wf9mi_iyM0HhWRZysFvCy0MmUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521065/acastro_210623_4645_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QFGFK7"&gt;Last week, a pair of YouTube’s most popular creators was set to spar in the marketplace of ideas &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/sam-seder-surprises-steven-crowder-ethan-klein-debate-youtube-2021-6"&gt;in a debate&lt;/a&gt; over the government’s simple, common sense advice to wear masks during a global pandemic to stop the persistent spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97s7R"&gt;The spat grew from a series of videos between right-wing provocateur Steven Crowder and the host of the &lt;em&gt;H3 Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, Ethan Klein, calling one another out for their purported bad takes on mask-wearing. In March, Crowder called out Klein for saying that “you shouldn’t think about” what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells you and just wear the mask, rather than criticizing the agency and its scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UakhL0"&gt;Crowder, who is widely known as the face of the “change my mind” meme, has challenged people to debates in the past, including college students on campuses all across the country. Klein, known for his comedy skits and pop culture commentary, is admittedly not the best debater. So instead of debating Crowder himself, Klein looped in Sam Seder, popular leftist host of &lt;em&gt;The Majority Report&lt;/em&gt;, as a surprise guest to take his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlYqWU"&gt;The “debate” immediately flamed out. Once Seder appeared on-screen, Crowder got squirrelly, slinging insults, and ultimately ditching the entire debate. Soon after recording, both Crowder and Klein released the footage. Both believed to have won by “owning” the other so publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lupA4"&gt;The whole fiasco raised serious questions about debate culture online and how platforms like YouTube and Twitch are influencing politics at large. I asked &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/style/hasan-piker-twitch.html"&gt;Hasan Piker&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Twitch commentator and former &lt;em&gt;Young Turks &lt;/em&gt;broadcast&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist, to talk about it. Piker has been a vocal critic of debate culture without shying away from his channel’s political clout. As he tells it, the “debate me” challenge is just a branding exercise — and it’s one he’s increasingly willing to skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp3nBI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPh8SA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to the Steven Crowder and Sam Seder debate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZqTt"&gt;Personally, I think all of this is just bullshit. I’ve done debates on the internet, and it’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive. I think it can help start a lot of people down the road of deradicalization, but what I have to recognize is that it fosters a really toxic environment. People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top dog debater is. So it turns into team sports. It’s not necessarily grounding your ideology in materialism, and instead, it’s just basically repeating talking points from the new intellectual daddy or father figure that you appreciate or enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWZ4vB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting you bring that up — the concept of team sports. When I watched the “debate” last week, my mind went straight to the Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley debates in the late ’60s. It felt like a moment where culture was beginning to override ideas, largely due to television as the medium for political debate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTCZAB"&gt;I’ll tell you another thing that’s ironic about the Vidal-Buckley debates. Those debates can be TLDR’d into one of them calling the other “queer” as a pejorative and then the other calls the other a “fascist.” If we look at that as the peak of intellectual debates, even back then, ultimately, they can still be reduced to the same shit-slinging operation. And you’re right, it is all about culture and personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVLXBe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of the debate last week, how do you think YouTube as a medium influenced the discussion? Each person was recording and could shape the discussion by changing the camera angles, muting someone, or turning their volume down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCEbqa"&gt;That’s a really unique perspective. I obviously talked about that on stream, but I never thought of the broader implications of it or considered how one-sided that is. It plays into the uneven playing field of the argument. Those decisions to alter camera angles were a deliberate attempt by Steven Crowder to stop his audience from recognizing what had happened in an effort to silence and seize full control ... And that was done in an effort to make himself seem more defensible in the eyes of his audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ytzm1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet has revolutionized the way people get their information. But at the same time, do you think it allows creators to control the narrative and decide their own winner on their platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQy63q"&gt;These debates are rarely about ideas, but instead a personal branding project. That’s probably why it hit so hard for Crowder to try and defend himself. Sorry, I’m simultaneously downloading &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to be playing that later on stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtzR6q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMAGLC"&gt;It’s probably dog shit. I hate golf. But it’s whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCWgaJ"&gt;Oh, yeah. For Steven Crowder, who has built his entire branding about how he is an intellectual type, much like Ben Shapiro has built his brand around being a guy who does debates and defeats liberals in the marketplace of ideas — it hits different. That’s why he had significantly more to lose. That’s what was going on. That’s why he had to take all the actions he did, and that’s why he kept dodging Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VLvb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now I want to get into a conversation about why you do what you do. I know there are a lot of people my age who get their news online and through these streamers. How do you feel about that responsibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e3mNG"&gt;It’s definitely something I think about a lot. I have a pretty stable moral grounding and worldview, and I try to do right by everyone and be as transparent as possible. I communicate that I do have biases just like everyone else. It’s pretty obvious when you come in. I do criticize the Democratic Party quite frequently and the Republican Party even more frequently than that. But that doesn’t mean I’m providing this purely neutral objective analysis. I think all the people who claim to be doing that are lying and benefiting from having the default position be neoliberal capitalism. If there’s injustice and you’re taking a neutral position in the face of injustice, you’re siding with the oppressor. You’re still not neutral. That’s my take on it. That’s why I do my commentary in the way that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNomD2"&gt;I try my best as humanly possible to read up in the limited amount of time I have leading up to a stream to prepare for the stream itself. And on top of that, I’m actively trying to make sure that I’m not misinforming anyone. I also have a pretty solid checking mechanism. If you’ve been in chat long enough, you know that as much as people like to talk about safe spaces or an echo chamber that I’ve cultivated in my community, I am not averse to criticism. I thrive in it. I love it. I look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrtP5I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see streaming and YouTube becoming more popular with younger people looking for new pundits and news online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS6pJ4"&gt;Well, there’s still going to be a need for journalists to make the news. I hope that never changes. I do worry that like — I’m an idiot. I’m an asshole. I don’t want the entire news media to be comprised of other idiot assholes like me. I know that what I do is basically supposed to be the reward after a career of doing journalism, and I get that. Op-eds are supposed to be rewards that you give to people who did 25 years out in like combat zones, for the most part sharking State Department propaganda and lying to them and stuff like that. Still, those people are putting in the work, and they finally get their comfortable office gig in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;or another reputable place, and then that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkyDNO"&gt;Now, what I do is a way to completely bypass that and even go beyond the office-gig economy, which is now turning into Substack and stuff like that. But if everyone wanted to do that, it would ruin everything. I still believe that journalists, like real journalists, should do real news, which I am not. I am not a real journalist. I’m not doing real news. I’m a commentator. I hope that never goes away. That would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIiNt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people that you’re interacting with on Twitch in chat, you’re accountable to them. They might unsubscribe. What’s that relationship like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjS7Vc"&gt;For the degenerate dumbasses that are op-ed writers and commentators like myself, what I do is absolutely a million times harder. I will say this with my chest: what I do, it looks like I’m sitting in a living room and shooting the shit, it is very easy. I’m not going to a fucking coal mine. But in comparison to what Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss do, what I do is a million times more difficult if you are so used to being in an ivory tower where you get very little criticism. All you need to do is just shut it off. Like your comments under your &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article are not going to drastically redefine your op-ed piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5N6RXH"&gt;My entire content revolves around constant back-and-forth communication, and it’s a very different layer of trying to control that. But I love that. I think that’s a good thing. As far as the take economy goes, I think what I do is pretty solid. I think it’s a good thing to have endless amounts of feedback from virtually every single person who wishes to do so, which is why I don’t have a sub-only feed. Some communities, when they grow to my size, the streamer will shut down their chat to subscriber-only. I don’t do that on purpose because I want to have these sorts of conversations with people, and I don’t want the money to prevent them from happening. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk counts on 500,000 Starlink users within the next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MWC Barcelona 2021 Trade Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gjy3uQRXWeJKllICy9n96k6-j38=/0x0:1761x1174/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521037/1326124843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joan Cros / Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANxurW"&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet network, Starlink, should have roughly 500,000 users within the next 12 months, Elon Musk said at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference on Tuesday. SpaceX’s current goal, Musk said, is to beam broadband internet to most of the planet by August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCmuot"&gt;The internet network, in the midst of an open beta phase, has launched more than 1,700 satellites to low-Earth orbit since 2018 and recently surpassed a “strategically significant” benchmark of 69,420 active users, Musk told MWC. He said Starlink is already running in 12 countries and expanding. “We’re I think on our way to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v8Y69"&gt;Reaching half a million users in the next year and unlocking global internet coverage — minus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22350643/oneweb-spacex-racing-broadband-internet-arctic-military"&gt;Arctic regions&lt;/a&gt; — in the next two months is a wildly ambitious goal for Starlink. The internet service will be sold directly to consumers in the world’s most rural areas and to governments looking for better military internet connections (among other customers). Many individual users are paying $99 per month for internet under the beta, using a $499 bundle of a self-aligning Starlink dish and Wi-Fi router. SpaceX is promising 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds. Reviews so far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;have been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/spacexs-starlink-early-users-review-service-internet-speed-price.html"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzC5xu"&gt;Challenges abound on the path to opening up commercial service and providing global internet coverage. While the cost of each Starlink terminal is $499 for consumers, Musk admitted at the conference that each terminal costs SpaceX double that, over $1,000. The company has already cut the terminal cost in half from $3,000 and is aiming to reduce it to the “few hundred dollar range within the next year or two,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in April. Musk maintained a key goal for SpaceX is avoiding bankruptcy as it passes through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;deep chasm&lt;/a&gt; of negative cash flow. Starlink’s main competitor, OneWeb, filed for — and since recovered from — bankruptcy last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QgSXP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Filling in the gaps between 5G and fiber”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPNlp7"&gt;Musk said the Starlink team has signed deals with two “major country” telecom operators, but he didn’t name them. He considers Starlink to be “complementary” to existing 5G providers rather than directly competing with them. “You can think of Starlink as filling in the gaps between 5G and fiber and really getting to the parts of the world that are the hardest to reach,” he said. Asked how much he’ll have to invest in Starlink, Musk said it depends how you define investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y23pug"&gt;“Before we go to positive cash flow, it’ll be at least $5 billion, and maybe as much as $10 [billion]. So it’s quite a lot,” he said, adding, “We’ll have to keep investing a great deal after that point” to remain relevant among competitors. The total Starlink investment will round out to $20–30 billion, he said. Once the network is fully up and running, SpaceX hopes it could generate around &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/exclusive-peek-at-spacex-data-shows-loss-in-2015-heavy-expectations-for-nascent-internet-service-1484316455"&gt;$30 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenue with Starlink and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126540/spacex-starlink-internet-space-mega-constellation-ipo-spinoff-gwynne-shotwell"&gt;split it off from SpaceX for an IPO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pE4xRN"&gt;Most of that revenue will fund SpaceX’s Starship system, the centerpiece of Musk’s ambitions to ferry humans to the Moon and Mars. Musk, known for tossing around wildly ambitious development timelines, said at the conference that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434825/elon-musk-spacex-first-orbital-starship-test-texas-hawaii"&gt;the first orbital Starship test launch&lt;/a&gt; could come sometime in “the next few months” — a slightly different timetable than July, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/spacex-aims-to-launch-first-orbital-starship-flight-in-july.html"&gt;Shotwell said at a conference&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Qipt"&gt;“There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1409963681807544320?s=20"&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; to one reporter on Twitter. “Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp;amp; there will be external issues too.”&lt;/p&gt;
