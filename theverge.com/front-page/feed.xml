    <title>Report finds Doximity, a social network for doctors, is riddled with anti-vaccine comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2VDmQLz5KrbmaliVTHpOnEVTn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692977/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaccine misinformation appears rampant on a social media site for doctors | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H5wAkq"&gt;A social media site for doctors is seeing “hundreds of comments”— many with false claims and conspiracy theories— on posts about the COVID-19 vaccine and the pandemic, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Doximity is limited to healthcare professionals in the US— it verifies members before they can join— and no one who posts to the site is anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Y9VI"&gt;Doximity also doesn’t allow users to post articles or stories; instead it posts items from medical and science publications and mainstream news articles. Each user has a feed of aggregated content that is customized for them, based on the user’s preferences including area of medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9If3m"&gt;But Doximity members &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on articles, which is where the misinformation and conspiracy theories seem to proliferate, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported. For instance, it found comments on a recent article about face masks for children included many from doctors who oppose the vaccine, saying masking children was “ridiculous” and “a form of child abuse.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoM8DV"&gt;This, despite the overwhelming evidence and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;guidance from public health organizations&lt;/a&gt; that masks help prevent the spread of the virus, and, the fact that there &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-next-stage-of-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-in-united-states-children-under-12/"&gt;isn’t yet a  COVID-19 vaccine approved&lt;/a&gt; for children under 12 years old. And, despite rules in Doximity’s own &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/clinicians/community_guidelines"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; which list “spreading false or misleading information” as grounds for removal from the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5x1q7"&gt;Doximity is scheduled to release its &lt;a href="https://investors.doximity.com/news/events/event-details/2021/Doximity-Q1-2022-Earnings-Call/default.aspx"&gt;first-quarter results&lt;/a&gt; on August 10th. The company, which was founded in 2010, launched its IPO in June, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021012935/doximity-424b4.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it had 1.8 million members, which included 80 percent of physicians in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1jpl"&gt;The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s full report here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter appoints “grievance officer” to comply with India’s new rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SqJWPpaO3qwuQjBKlnGRIKUyyng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692794/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has hired a grievance officer in India | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xl6u9i"&gt;Twitter has appointed two new executives in India in an attempt to comply with the country’s new information technology laws, a company lawyer told the Delhi High court at a Friday hearing. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/twitter-says-has-appointed-officials-to-comply-with-india-rules"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the new executives is a chief compliance officer who will also serve as &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india"&gt;grievance officer,&lt;/a&gt; and the other is a nodal officer, both required by the country’s Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code which took effect in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBellz"&gt;Twitter made the appointments a week after the Indian government found the social media platform’s efforts to comply with the new rules were insufficient. Under the rules, social media companies are required to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a legal order. The country also requires such companies to have a grievance officer who acknowledges users’ complaints within 24 hours, a chief compliance officer, and a contact person who would be available to respond to law enforcement agencies 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ2v4l"&gt;But on July 28th, &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/total-non-compliance-by-twitter-hc/articleshow/84845519.cms"&gt;a judge found that Twitter’s appointment&lt;/a&gt; of an employee through a third-party contractor to be the grievance and compliance officer was “unacceptable.” The rules require that officer to be a senior staff member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwVxjg"&gt;The government had argued in a legal filing last month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;Twitter had lost its legal immunity&lt;/a&gt; for failing to adhere to the new rules, making it legally liable for content posted by its users in India. In May, police &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter’s India offices&lt;/a&gt; after the platform labeled a government official’s tweets as “manipulated media.” And in June, a government minister warned the platform there could be “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to comply with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JkmVb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We have taken significant steps towards compliance to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 and have kept the Indian Government closely informed of our progress,” a Twitter spokesperson in India wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. “We remain committed to safeguarding the voices and privacy of those using our service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SP3oM9"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, India’s government will now review whether the new appointments meet the rules, and will hear the case again on August 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAw2tv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOR1g4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mtk5F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream-video-1-QXEVV1DWRGG001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt9WI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slUsDx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paCaWf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhEfkS"&gt;It’s time for another roundup of this week’s best deals. You may have already seen some of these if you’ve been keeping up with our deals coverage every day, but I’m sure there are some surprises in here. Before that, though, &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/24672525.29/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNTg2MjY0L2JhY2stdG8tc2Nob29sLWdpZnQtaWRlYXMtY29sbGVnZS1kb3JtLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXN1cHBsaWVzLXRlY2gtZ2FkZ2V0cw/60ca3936dba83e5914705c33B27cc4c40"&gt;check out our newly-published Back to School gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. The beginning of August marks when many people who attend school realize how little time they actually have to prepare for the school year ahead. If that describes you or someone you know, I hope that our guide helps you. Otherwise, carry on to see what we’ve brought you this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zyCmUi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dz9eqL"&gt;Get a Nomad case for your MacBook or iPad for half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ikdI"&gt;Nomad is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers an exclusive discount on some of its polyurethane (PU) leather cases and sleeves for the latest MacBook models (both 13- and 16-inch), as well as the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeRoundup08072021/https://nomadgoods.com/collections/pu-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Take a look at its offerings&lt;/a&gt;, and if you see something that you like, punch in the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEDEALS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to see its price fall by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="POvYiC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yVGwxh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wdponA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, PS5 is up to 50 percent off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwMGbR"&gt;Whether you have any attachment to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; or not, it’s worth picking up the &lt;em&gt;Remake &lt;/em&gt;for PS4 or PS5, as it’s both very good and more affordable than usual for a limited time. You can grab a &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000/"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; or buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZS80PC2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free with purchase) for $30, down from $60&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeYHpa"&gt;If you have a PS5, the special edition called Intergrade that includes the new Yuffie episode in addition to the base game is just $50 &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177/"&gt;digitally&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XNRM6QN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on disc&lt;/a&gt; (usually $70)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="klBXvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ujHVF2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kssq3u"&gt;A three-pack of Google Wifi routers is $150 at Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KCIfvF"&gt;One of this week’s most popular deals was, unsurprisingly, this fantastic sale on a three-pack of Google Wifi routers. Normally $200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s still $150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Google usually charges $100 for a single router, but you can outfit your home with a whole mesh Wi-Fi system comprised of three routers (each of which has dual gigabit ethernet ports) for just $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HeKQc8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xcgb2c"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AWz9nc"&gt;The 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in red is $300 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WIvIiw"&gt;The best deal currently available on the Apple Watch Series 6 is at Woot, where you can get &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-40mm-productred-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in the all-red colorway for $300&lt;/a&gt; (normally $400). This is the model that we see discounted most often, perhaps because of its divisive color scheme. Just to note: $250 is the lowest price that we’ve seen for this one, and Apple may unveil the successor to the Series 6 at its annual fall hardware event. But, if you need a watch now, this is a solid deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kc2ufm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="6zDiIj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify says it plans to add AirPlay 2 to its iOS app — eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDD20yR_WaPMtNUO2rsOrGSinnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69690480/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qolgag"&gt;Spotify still hasn’t added AirPlay 2 support to its iOS app — but despite the delay, it’s still “working to make [it] a reality,” the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Some doubt was cast on AirPlay 2 inclusion when &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/spotify-pauses-airplay-2-support-for-ios-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; spotted a forum post&lt;/a&gt; where a Spotify forum moderator claimed that &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/iOS-Airplay-2-Support-for-iOS/idc-p/5244350/highlight/true#M235171"&gt;“audio driver compatibility issues”&lt;/a&gt; might mean the feature wouldn’t be added for the foreseeable future. Spotify now claims that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIlb4R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received the following statement from Spotify regarding AirPlay 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="l6Ose4"&gt;A post on one of Spotify’s Community pages contained incomplete information regarding our plans for AirPlay2. Spotify will support AirPlay2 and we’re working to make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5hM8lP"&gt;AirPlay 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17403684/airplay-2-ios-114-stereo-homepod-available-now"&gt;added as part of iOS 11 update&lt;/a&gt;, introduced multiroom audio, Siri voice control, and fairly broad support across a wide swath of speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173637/tv-airplay-2-apple-lg-samsung-sony-vizio-ces-2019"&gt;televisions&lt;/a&gt;, and streaming services. It was a real first for Apple’s “casting” feature, which had previously been somewhat poorly supported outside of Apple’s own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIY2Ct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’m not going to call it petty, but...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w59IH1"&gt;Spotify has its own way to get audio from its service to other devices in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/"&gt;Spotify Connect&lt;/a&gt;, but considering Spotify already supports Google Cast, skipping Apple’s newest streaming protocol would seem like an odd omission. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes, Apple provides a seemingly simple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/getting_airplay_2_into_your_app"&gt;four step developer document&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to enable the feature. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?s=20"&gt;developer Marco Arment points&lt;/a&gt; out that the fourth step (adopting a new API that supports enhanced buffering) is a bigger hurdle than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BhtYf6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;…and that new API:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is barely documented&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- has no public sample code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is full of major gotchas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- can’t change speeds seamlessly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- doesn’t provide precise timing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- requires much more complex logic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is less efficient, which can cause background CPU-overage terminations&lt;/p&gt;— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ALoR"&gt;But add in that Spotify has a less-than-friendly relationship with Apple, even going as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;filing an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;publicly calling it a bully&lt;/a&gt;, and a choice to not prioritize incorporating AirPlay 2 makes even more sense. It’s good that it’s still happening, but for any Spotify subscriber on iOS, it’s hard to not feel like you’re caught in the crossfire between two tech giants on the outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlsirN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 6th, 6:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and added statement from Spotify confirming it is working on AirPlay2 support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tmCRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTGRkI"&gt;Microsoft is working on a new night mode for Xbox consoles. The software giant has started testing this night mode with Xbox Insiders in the &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/06/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2109-210804-2200/"&gt;Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt; today, and it allows Xbox owners to dim their screens, controller LED brightness, and even the Xbox power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88GLAW"&gt;The night mode has a lot of customization, including different dimming levels and an optional blue light filter. Microsoft is also allowing Xbox owners to dim the LED brightness on their controllers in this night mode and dim the Xbox power button light or turn it off. You can also set an Xbox to switch to the system dark mode and disable HDR when the night mode is enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-KsnZIhfZsEUnLZw7NhBErpD50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22767178/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_08_06_22_27_18.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox night mode lets you dim a controller LED brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NtT7NJ"&gt;This Xbox night mode can also be set to a schedule, either a manual one or an automatic one that will enable it at sunset and disable it at sunrise. Microsoft is currently testing this with Xbox Insiders, so expect to see it filter through the various testing channels in the coming weeks before arriving on all Xbox consoles soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp lead and other tech experts fire back at Apple’s Child Safety plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGtA_nWVkDJWCy43HTsdInDqf6Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691082/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I80BZO"&gt;WhatsApp won’t be adopting &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;Apple’s new Child Safety measures&lt;/a&gt;, meant to stop the spread of child abuse imagery, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?s=20"&gt;WhatsApp’s head Will Cathcart&lt;/a&gt;. In a Twitter thread, he explains his belief that Apple “has built software that can scan all the private photos on your phone,” and said that Apple has taken the wrong path in trying to improve its response to child sexual abuse material, or CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoRGi4"&gt;Apple’s plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;which it announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, involves taking hashes of images uploaded to iCloud and comparing them to a database that contains hashes of known CSAM images. According to Apple, this allows it to keep user data encrypted and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1423726172849033216?s=20"&gt;run the analysis on-device&lt;/a&gt; while still allowing it to report users to the authorities if they’re found to be sharing child abuse imagery. Another prong of Apple’s Child Safety strategy involves optionally warning parents if their child &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1423389211542032384"&gt;under 13 years old&lt;/a&gt; sends or views photos containing sexually explicit content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612934/apple-vp-memo-concerns-privacy-new-scanning-photos-images-ios"&gt;An internal memo at Apple&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that people would be “worried about the implications” of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zcRqL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I read the information Apple put out yesterday and I'm concerned. I think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people's privacy all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have asked if we'll adopt this system for WhatsApp. The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOKTKj"&gt;Cathcart &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701476841385988?s=20"&gt;calls Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt; “very concerning,” saying that it would allow governments with different ideas of what kind of images are and are not acceptable to request that Apple add non-CSAM images to the databases it’s comparing images against. Cathcart says WhatsApp’s system to fight child exploitation, which partly utilizes user reports, preserves encryption like Apple’s and has led to the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701475595755524?s=20"&gt;reporting over 400,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2020. (Apple is also working with the Center for its CSAM detection efforts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuhKXJ"&gt;WhatsApp’s owner, Facebook, has reasons to pounce on Apple for privacy concerns. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;changes to how ad tracking works in iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; started a fight between the two companies, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;buying newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Apple’s privacy changes as harmful to small businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple fired back&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the change “simply requires” that users be given a choice on whether to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1dseaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cathcart calls Apple’s approach “very concerning,” and he’s not alone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLRoUJ"&gt;It’s not just WhatsApp that has criticized Apple’s new Child Safety measures, though. The list of people and organizations raising concerns includes Edward Snowden, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, professors, and more. We’ve collected some of those reactions here to act as an overview of some of the criticisms levied against Apple’s new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TJSuYM"&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZcaWR"&gt;Matthew Green, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, pushed back on the feature before it was publicly announced. He tweeted about Apple’s plans and about how the hashing system could be abused by governments and malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="My9zJN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These tools will allow Apple to scan your iPhone photos for photos that match a specific perceptual hash, and report them to Apple servers if too many appear.&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423072476888805376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpR2F"&gt;The EFF &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; that blasted Apple’s plan, more or less calling it a “thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor.” The EFF’s press release goes into detail on how it believes Apple’s Child Safety measures could be abused by governments and how they decrease user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jacoNW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple's filtering of iMessage and iCloud is not a slippery slope to backdoors that suppress speech and make our communications less secure. We’re already there: this is a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change. &lt;a href="https://t.co/f2nv062t2n"&gt;https://t.co/f2nv062t2n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EFF (@EFF) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1423375818693038084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yuo1qD"&gt;Kendra Albert, an instructor at Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic, has a thread on the potential dangers to queer children and Apple’s initial lack of clarity around age ranges for the parental notifications feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6bBV1n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The idea that parents are safe people for teens to have conversations about sex or sexting with is admirable, but in many cases, not true. (And as far as I can tell, this stuff doesn't just apply to kids under the age for 13.)&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423367106972852228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="p5xtGT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;EFF reports that the iMessage nudity notifications will not go to parents if the kid is between 13-17 but that is not anywhere in the Apple documentation that I can find. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW"&gt;https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423436593696854018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqw4k"&gt;Edward Snowden retweeted the &lt;em&gt;Financial Time&lt;/em&gt;s article about the system, giving his own characterization of what Apple is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CCaMt8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple plans to modify iPhones to constantly scan for contraband: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is an absolutely appalling idea, because it is going to lead to distributed bulk surveillance of our phones and laptops,” said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ"&gt;https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1423387232963022848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sceSPL"&gt;Politician Brianna Wu called the system “the worst idea in Apple History.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wB779u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the worst idea in Apple history, and I don't say that lightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It destroys their credibility on privacy. It will be abused by governments. It will get gay children killed and disowned. This is the worst idea ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2"&gt;https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BriannaWu/status/1423384759858774026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="H0QULK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to state: Apple's scanning does not detect photos of child abuse. It detects a list of known banned images added to a database, which are initially child abuse imagery found circulating elsewhere. What images are added over time is arbitrary. It doesn't know what a child is.&lt;/p&gt;— SoS (@SwiftOnSecurity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1423383256003747840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1g6Co"&gt;Writer Matt Blaze also tweeted about the concerns that the technology could be abused by overreaching governments, trying to prevent content other than CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PouZDU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In other words, not only does the policy have to be exceptionally robust, so does the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;— matt blaze (@mattblaze) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1423476875817635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rvN3WU"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney also criticized Apple, saying that the company “vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default.” He also promised to share more thoughts specifically about Apple’s Child Safety system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wfglq3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s atrocious how Apple vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default, hides the 15+ separate options to turn parts of it off in Settings underneath your name, and forces you to have an unwanted email account. Apple would NEVER allow a third party to ship an app like this.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423728945225211908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kuuOuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will share some very detailed thoughts on this related topic later.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423730378234376206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YCGmI"&gt;Not every reaction has been critical, however. Ashton Kutcher (who has done &lt;a href="https://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/14/moore-kutcher-join-our-crusade-to-end-child-sex-trafficking/"&gt;advocacy work to end child sex trafficking since 2011&lt;/a&gt;) calls Apple’s work “a major step forward” for efforts to eliminate CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFDxLg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe in privacy - including for kids whose sexual abuse is documented and spread online without consent. These efforts announced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; are a major step forward in the fight to eliminate CSAM from the internet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX"&gt;https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aplusk/status/1423387418451922950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in the US are required to wear masks again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-LOGISTICS-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0LIFX_QoVHjYmnymk5ncpVclZM=/194x0:4606x2941/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691038/1232843235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ronny Hartmann / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MC8zj"&gt;Amazon informed US warehouse employees on Friday that it is once again requiring them to wear masks to work in response to the spread of the more contagious COVID-19 delta variant (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/amazon-resumes-mask-mandate-in-warehouses-amid-rising-covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/amazon-tells-warehouse-workers-to-mask-up-again-as-virus-spreads?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says it offers &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/more-than-half-a-million-amazon-frontline-employees-have-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-through-on-site-vaccination-events"&gt;access to vaccines to over half a million of its employees&lt;/a&gt;, but it will require employees to mask up, regardless of their vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDpp8l"&gt; Amazon confirmed the mask mandate in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wMnFhi"&gt;In response to the concerning spread of new COVID-19 variants in the U.S. and guidance from public health authorities and our own medical experts, we are requiring face coverings indoors regardless of vaccination status. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to follow local government guidance and work closely with leading medical healthcare professionals, gathering their advice and recommendations as we go forward to ensure our buildings are optimized for the safety of our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bw6utH"&gt;Non-warehouse employees currently don’t have to deal with Amazon’s policy change. The company recently adjusted its return-to-office plans on August 5th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;pushing back its return date&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. Like other companies, Amazon had &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/amazon-wants-office-workers-back-3-days-a-week-in-september?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously considered implementing a hybrid work schedule&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to bring office workers back to offices for at least part of the week starting on September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hod8UR"&gt;Taking the extra precautions for warehouse employees seems like the right idea if it plans to continue having staff work in person. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;reported in October 2020&lt;/a&gt; that 19,816 workers of its 1,372,000 frontline employees across Whole Foods and Amazon had COVID-19 “or where presumed positive” from March 1st to September 19th, 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJePFy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gWfpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a better way for Facebook to resolve its fight with NYU researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxpgVz16oQdKV8BEHYDocU3jGp4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69690498/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJ9aYp"&gt;More and more, I find myself wondering why we built a world in which so much civic discourse takes place inside a handful of giant digital shopping malls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7VqNp"&gt;So let’s talk about Facebook’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;to disable the pages and personal accounts associated with the Ad Observatory project at New York University&lt;/a&gt;, which took data that had been volunteered by willing Facebook users and analyzed it in an effort to better understand the 2020 election and other subjects in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1AmUn"&gt;In one corner, you have academic researchers working to understand the platform’s effects on our democracy. In the other, you have a company battered by nearly two decades of privacy scandals and regulatory fines, forever terrified that a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR8qGmyEQg"&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; sequel is lurking somewhere on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcEsLr"&gt;I first wrote about this case in October, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-blocks-a-browser-extension?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDEyNjIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE0MjI0OTQ2LCJfIjoiZHhYckEiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjgwODYxNTUsImV4cCI6MTYyODA4OTc1NSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q94bwlvejRXzgVg-_A5EGw%E2%80%94HSkTBEswHDUnU5-ahME"&gt;when Facebook sent its initial cease-and-desist notice to the researchers&lt;/a&gt;. The issue concerned&lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt; a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; created by an NYU team that, if installed, collects data about the ads you see on Facebook, including information about how those ads are targeted. Facebook already makes similar data publicly available through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;media_type=all"&gt;online ad archive&lt;/a&gt;, but the NYU researchers say it’s incomplete and sometimes inaccurate — among other things, they say, many political ads are never labeled as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wT5JIL"&gt;No one I have spoken to at Facebook believes that NYU’s work is not fundamentally in the public interest. Other mediums for political advertising don’t allow campaigns to target voters with nearly the level of precision that Facebook does, and the lingering belief that Facebook swung the 2016 election to Donald Trump drew heightened scrutiny to the company’s ad practices in 2020. It’s no wonder academics want to study the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l3c3R"&gt;Anticipating this interest,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248806/facebook-us-2020-election-data-research-political-ad-targeting"&gt; the company established the Facebook Open Research and Transparency platform earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But like most of the company’s academic partnerships, FORT has been criticized for being too limited in the view of Facebook that it provides. In the case of the election, for example, it will only provide data from the 90 days before Election Day — despite the fact that the presidential campaign lasted well over a year. Moreover, researchers say, FORT requires researchers to access data on a laptop furnished by Facebook, preventing them from using their own machine-learning classifiers and other tools on the data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GjZQZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;when NYC received the cease-and-desist, they planned to ignore it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQkBG"&gt;That’s why, when the NYU team received that cease-and-desist last fall, they said they planned to ignore it. “The only thing that would prompt us to stop doing this would be if Facebook would do it themselves, which we have called on them to do,” researcher Laura Edelson&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-shutdown-of-nyu-research-project-into-political-ad-targeting-11603488533"&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyytPg"&gt;Facebook said it wouldn’t ban NYU until well after the election, and was true to its word. But on Tuesday night, the company dropped the hammer on the NYU team. “We took these actions to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people’s privacy in line with our privacy program under the FTC order,”&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; Mike Clark, a product management director, referring to Facebook’s&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook"&gt; consent decree&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezynjs"&gt;Alex Abdo, an attorney for the NYU researchers, told me that he was taken aback by Facebook’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiHLs5"&gt;“On the one hand, it’s not surprising — on the other hand, it’s totally shocking that Facebook’s response to research that the public really needs right now is to try to shut it down,” he said in an interview. “Privacy in research and social media is a genuinely hard question. But the answer can’t be that Facebook unilaterally decides. And there is not an independent research project out there that is more respectful of user privacy than the Ad Observer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rljUDQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="2BYpIG"&gt;So let’s talk about privacy. The Ad Observer was designed to collect data about individual ads and the people they were targeted at, and also to anonymize that data. Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox browser, conducted a review of the extension’s code and its consent flow and ultimately recommended that people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdZdYL"&gt;“We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency,” Marshall Erwin, the company’s chief security officer, &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rAvuc"&gt;You probably won’t be surprised to learn that Facebook sees it differently. Despite the lengths to which the researchers have gone here, the company told me, the Ad Observer still collects data that some users may object to. If an individual pays to boost a post, such as for a fundraiser, information including that user’s name and photo winds up in the NYU researchers’ hands. The Ad Observer may also collect similar information from comments on ads. And Facebook says information gleaned from an ad’s “why am I seeing this?” panel “can be used to identify other people who interacted with the ads and determine personal information about them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WBD4"&gt;In any of these cases, the actual harm to the user would seem to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; minor, if you can call it a harm at all. But Facebook says it’s against their rules, and they have to enforce those rules, not least because Cambridge Analytica was a story about&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/24/aleksandr-kogan-cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-business-ventures"&gt; a researcher with seemingly good intentions&lt;/a&gt; who ultimately sold off the data he collected and created arguably the biggest scandal in company history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3zeMsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cambridge Analytica was about a researcher with seemingly good intentions &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh749j"&gt;It’s for that reason that I have at least some empathy for Facebook here. The company is continuously under fire for the way it collects and uses personal data, and here you have a case where the company is trying to &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; that data collection, and many of the same critics who are still bringing up Cambridge Analytica on Twitter three years later are simultaneously arguing that Facebook has a moral obligation to let the Ad Observatory slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGaio9"&gt;But letting things slide is not really in the spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation, California’s own privacy act, and any number of other privacy regulations. (As one smart person put it in our &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel server&lt;/a&gt;: “GDPR does not have a general research exemption.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfOljf"&gt;Contrary to some earlier reporting, Facebook is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; arguing that Ad Observer violates its FTC consent decree, it told me. But the company has at least some good reasons to prevent large-scale data scraping like the kind represented by the NYU researchers. The&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/clearview-ai-valuation.html"&gt; rise of Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt;, a dystopian surveillance company that built facial recognition in part by collecting publicly available photos on Facebook, has made that case in a visceral way this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P6uJuD"&gt;
&lt;p id="UQCG1d"&gt;While the fight between NYU and Facebook got ugly this week, I think there are some obvious (though difficult) paths forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OilGVz"&gt;One is that Facebook could expand its current data export tools to allow us to contribute our data to projects like the Ad Observer voluntarily, but in an even more privacy-protective way. To hear Facebook tell it, if NYU’s browser extension collected just a handful fewer types of data, it might have been palatable to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7w3LK8"&gt;If you believe users have a right to discuss their personal experiences on Facebook, I think you should also agree they have a right to volunteer personal data that speaks to that experience. By Facebook’s nature, anyone’s personal experience is going to have a lot of other potentially non-consenting friends’ data wrapped up in it, too. But the company&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254"&gt; already lets me export my friends’ data&lt;/a&gt; — when they tag me in comments, send me Facebook messages, and so on. The company is already way closer to figuring out a way to let me share this information with researchers than it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNqzSb"&gt;Another option — rarely used in the United States — is that Congress could pass a law. It could write national privacy legislation, for example, and create a dedicated carveout for qualified academic researchers. It could require platforms to disclose more data in general, to academics and everyone else. It could establish a federal agency dedicated to the oversight of online communication platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9cj4F"&gt;The alternative, as always, is to wait for platforms to regulate themselves — and to continuously be disappointed by the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr4uEL"&gt;The NYU-Facebook spat was always going to end up in the place we find it today: neither side had any good incentive to back down. But we all have reason to hope that researchers and tech companies come to better terms. Too much is at stake for the platforms to remain a black box forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXKREV"&gt;“You would think they would be able to distinguish between the Cambridge Analyticas of the world, and the good-faith, privacy-respecting researchers of the world,” Abdo told me. “If they can’t do that, then there really is no hope for independent research on Facebook’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5nhyc"&gt;If Facebook can’t — or won’t — make that distinction, Congress should make it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VlGPdo"&gt;

    <title>Razer will let you sign up to beta test its RGB face mask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sb8fAZsq82C-U1WctXeS9vpu5hs=/63x0:1530x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689974/Screen_Shot_2021_08_06_at_11.01.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mW1VJT"&gt;Razer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1423660327762374662?s=20"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its lit-like-a-gaming-PC N95 mask has a new name and a beta program set up ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524990/razer-hazel-mask-first-launch-early-fourth-quarter-2021-drops"&gt;the planned fourth quarter launch&lt;/a&gt;. The futuristic-looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Project Hazel&lt;/a&gt; has been christened the Razer Zephyr, and you can sign up to be a beta tester &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcampaigns%2Froad-to-zephyr%23signup&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now on Razer’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYeszY"&gt;Razer has not provided any additional information on the timing of the Zephyr’s release or when beta testers can expect to receive their masks. Based on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKIkNo-QMg&amp;amp;t=22s"&gt;the video Razer shared alongside its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, beta testers might get a different mask design from what’s been shared up until this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kVIsG6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMKIkNo-QMg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=22&amp;amp;start=22" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msCkpD"&gt;The Zephyr seems a tad wider and rounder than Razer’s original Project Hazel, and there’s a grille at the bottom of the mask that’s a lot more visible than previous images and photos have shown. It might be for additional ventilation or to assist in voice amplification, but it definitely wasn’t featured in Razer’s earlier concepts for the face mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYVE6C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Razer for more details on the beta program and any possible design changes that will ship alongside the Zephyr beta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fFKdKiVlkTC6gQz3yBL1xdRRSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766767/zephyr_teaser_1500x1000_gallery3.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR6GOMeCKt3NTuyN5VZqV75liN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399320/QTPjtwr.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Project Hazel design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6hVXwt"&gt;We should have a better idea about the design once masks actually make it into beta testers’ hands, but the announcement of the program in the first place does make the Zephyr that much more real. Considering the project went from a fun CES concept to a real thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Razer was intent on making&lt;/a&gt;, every step pushes this mask further from vaporware. Whether it’s actually affordable, enjoyable, or practical to wear is an entirely separate issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC finally made a new broadband map of the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wS0eUSzhJ-Rxjc9F9g3aolzq1ms=/184x0:1750x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689876/Screen_Shot_2021_08_06_at_9.06.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7eTcDY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-new-mobile-broadband-map"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has launched&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://fcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6c1b2e73d9d749cdb7bc88a0d1bdd25b"&gt;new map&lt;/a&gt; designed to show consumers what kind of cellular coverage they can expect in a given area from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon. It’s been a long time coming, and it doesn’t address &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like an improvement over the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;woefully inadequate and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; past attempts to show gaps in the nation’s broadband coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNVutI"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1423671191210954752?s=20"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it shouldn’t have taken this long for this map to be available. The &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/3/bill-to-improve-broadband-data-maps-signed-into-law"&gt;law requiring that these maps be made&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act, was signed in March 2020, and the lack of details about broadband coverage has created confusion about the so-called digital divide for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL7XuU"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the map isn’t based on data that the FCC collected or crowdsourced. FCC acting chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a news release that the data was provided by the carriers who don’t have a great reputation for having the most accurate picture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;of where they do and don’t provide broadband&lt;/a&gt; (though the FCC is working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;getting a better picture of home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22574103/internet-bill-equity-verge-consumer-reports-partnership"&gt;working on examining how cost-effective broadband is&lt;/a&gt;). The map also doesn’t address the issue with home internet availability, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/10/6131759/i-live-in-the-us-and-i-cant-get-home-internet"&gt;a long-running concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Xj9r3k-UzIq5KRkXH20J0jatkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766633/FCC_Map_Vs.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FCC’s map (left) versus T-Mobile (right, top), AT&amp;amp;T (right, middle), and Verizon’s (right, bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w05RVM"&gt;The interactive map lets users select which carrier’s coverage map they want to see, and it provides information about LTE coverage, voice coverage, or both. The FCC says the map is the work of its Broadband Data Task Force. The map is fairly user-friendly; instead of having to flip between &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22613096%2Ffcc-cellular-broadband-voice-availability-map-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; coverage maps, users can see all of the data in one place, overlaid on top of each other. The map also provides a distinction between data availability and voice availability — which is useful, as being able to make a call and being able to get online are obviously two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylnplN"&gt;One big thing the map is missing is data about 5G coverage, or really any indicator of what kind of speeds users can expect. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2021/08/06/new-mobile-map-preview-whats-come"&gt;In a note about the map’s launch&lt;/a&gt;, Rosenworcel says the network has to provide at least 5Mbps down and 1Mbps up to qualify as 4G data coverage. If one carrier provided an area with 100Mbps speeds and another provided 10Mbps speeds, that could be difficult to distinguish on the map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4ogxZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data for the map is provided by the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juNEm2"&gt;Rosenworcel also admits that this map is only a first step in the FCC’s work to improve the information available to consumers, but it’s an important one. It at least lets consumers know the minimum of what mobile coverage they should expect in a given area and gives them the tools to make more informed decisions about their cellular provider. Hopefully the FCC will be able to have a similar effort to map the availability of home internet connections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
