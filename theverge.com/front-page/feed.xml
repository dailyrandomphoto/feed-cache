    <title>ULA stops selling its centerpiece Atlas V, setting path for the rocket’s retirement</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jOEqmz"&gt;United Launch Alliance won’t be selling any more of its workhorse Atlas V rockets, and it has stopped buying the launch vehicle’s Russian-made rocket engines for good, the company’s chief executive told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;ULA’s decision sets up the retirement of one of the US government’s most trusted launch vehicles and is expected to mark the end for Russia’s iconic — but controversial — RD-180 engine, an engineering marvel and a core source of revenue for Russia’s space program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzMOw9"&gt;“We’re done. They’re all sold,” CEO Tory Bruno said of ULA’s Atlas V rockets in an interview. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has 29 Atlas V missions left before it retires sometime in the mid-2020s and transitions to its upcoming Vulcan rocket, Bruno said. The remaining Atlas V missions include a mix of undisclosed commercial customers and some for the Space Force, NASA, and Amazon’s budding broadband satellite constellation, Project Kuiper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZraOW"&gt;First launched in 2002, the expendable Atlas V launcher was the centerpiece vehicle that helped cement ULA’s near-monopoly on national security satellite missions and some of NASA’s biggest space exploration initiatives, including all of the agency’s robotic missions to Mars. But when the US sanctioned Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014, Congress directed the Air Force to end its reliance on Atlas V because of its Russian-made RD-180 engines. Current law requires the Space Force (which manages much of the launch-related duties that used to be under the Air Force) to stop using Atlas V for Pentagon launches by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden takes questions in front of an Atlas V rocket booster in 2011 before it launched NASA’s Curiosity rover to Mars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WNNag1"&gt;Bruno said three or four RD-180s are installed on Atlas V rockets for upcoming missions, and the rest are sitting in a warehouse. “We took early delivery, if you will, with the RD-180, so I can end that relationship and not be dependent upon [Russia] because that’s what Congress asked us to do,” he said. In all, the US has taken delivery of 122 RD-180 engines, generating billions in revenue for Russia’s space program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OulBVo"&gt;The last six RD-180 engines were delivered to the US in April, Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, has previously said. That month, Bruno’s Russian counterparts told the CEO that if ULA ever decides to buy more RD-180 engines in the future, they’d be willing to build more and sell. But with no plans for ULA to buy more, the RD-180 program will likely come to an end, Bruno said. He took Russia’s offer with a grain of salt, skeptical that Energomash, the state-owned manufacturer of the RD-180, would be able to restart its engine production line and testing regime after it closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP59EZ"&gt;A spokesperson for Roscosmos, which speaks on Energomash’s behalf, declined to comment on whether RD-180 production is ending. The space agency’s former director, Igor Komarov, said in 2017 that Roscosmos has had “requests from some countries that are developing launchers and their expertise in space” to use the RD-180 engine, but those prospective engine customers remain to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7SHdv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Atlas V saw tough competition from SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfyBSA"&gt;The geopolitics of the RD-180 engine wasn’t the only reality setting Atlas V back. The rocket struggled to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9, a cheaper reusable rocket that chipped away at ULA’s monopoly on government launch contracts. Though a recent win for the rocket came in April when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;Amazon revealed it picked Atlas V&lt;/a&gt; to launch its internet-beaming Kuiper satellites into space. The value of the deal wasn’t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdraeF"&gt;ULA has slashed the price for Atlas V missions from roughly $187 million to around $100 million as competition from SpaceX mounted, but it never closed in on Falcon 9’s launch price of roughly $62 million. Once a dominant force for national security launches, ULA now competes head to head with SpaceX for lucrative Pentagon launch contracts. Last year, Space Force awarded billions to ULA and SpaceX to launch 30 to 35 missions for the Pentagon between 2022 and 2027, with ULA getting 60 percent of the workload and SpaceX getting the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08hSyA"&gt;For those Pentagon missions, ULA will mainly use its next-generation lower-cost Vulcan rocket, the replacement for Atlas V. Vulcan will use BE-4 engines under development by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin — but those engines have been delayed, further pushing Vulcan’s launch debut from late 2021 into early 2022. Development issues with the engine’s turbo pump and excessive vibrations that would occur while the engine was test-firing were the main factors for the delays, Bruno said, but they’ve since been resolved. “What is pacing us now is just building hardware,” he said, expecting delivery of the first flight-ready engines by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T0hrNq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Obviously we’re concerned, but we’re engaged with ULA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ngnX26"&gt;The Space Force is weighing whether it’ll need to come up with “backup options,” should BE-4 delays continue into next year, Gen. Jason Cothern, the deputy commander of Space Force’s rocket acquisition unit, said Wednesday. Those options could include shifting some of Vulcan’s workload under its share of Pentagon launches to SpaceX, but officials are waiting to make a move on any contingencies until next year to see how the final chapter of BE-4 development plays out. “Obviously we’re concerned, but we’re engaged with ULA and they’re heavily engaged with Blue Origin to bring it along,” Cothern said, adding “we’re cautiously optimistic” that the flight-ready BE-4 engines will be delivered to ULA by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard to change name of Overwatch’s McCree following sexual harassment lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwfGwUtTaryZA_Bk3ecqAi3YlZQ=/60x0:2273x1475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779998/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_8.46.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gunslinger character in &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="apoeHv"&gt;Blizzard says it plans to change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1430964453865046025"&gt;the name of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch’s&lt;/em&gt; gunslinger character&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;explosive sexual harassment lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; brought against Activision Blizzard by the state of California. The character was originally named “McCree” after Jesse McCree, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;a former longtime Blizzard staffer&lt;/a&gt; who appears to be pictured in the so-called “Cosby Suite” &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;reported on by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqNJAX"&gt;Blizzard hasn’t shared a new name for the character yet, and the studio will delay an in-game narrative arc featuring the character formerly named McCree due to the change. The company also committed to no longer naming in-game characters after real employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EdC9qj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A message from the Overwatch team. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2W3AV7Pv6X"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2W3AV7Pv6X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1430964453865046025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LDdAd"&gt;Recently, some &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League casters had &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-league-casters-stop-saying-mccree-s-name-1847474058"&gt;chosen to not to say&lt;/a&gt; the gunslinger character’s former name, instead calling him “the cowboy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT2PkK"&gt;The planned change follows promised updates to &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; to remove &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;“references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; which may have referred to &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-harasser-from-lawsuit-is-still-all-over-world-1847345457"&gt;references of former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi in the game&lt;/a&gt;. Afrasiabi was singled out in the lawsuit for his problematic actions while at Blizzard. He &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;was fired from Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and appears to have worked for the company &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alex-afrasiabi-whered-he-go-o/749539"&gt;until June 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHPEIx"&gt;The change also follows a recent decision by Blizzard &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-isnt-making-any-more-skins-for-overwatch-leagu-1846540244"&gt;not to create skins for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League MVPs&lt;/a&gt; after sexual assault allegations surfaced against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323695/jay-sinatraa-won-valorant-suspended-sexual-assault-allegations"&gt;former &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; pro and MVP Jay “Sinatraa” Won&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERMu1s"&gt;When Blizzard confirmed that McCree was no longer at the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;, it said that longtime employees Luis Barriga and Jonathan LeCraft were gone, too. Blizzard’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;former head of HR Jesse Meschuk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;former president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt; also left earlier in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNT4uL"&gt;This week, California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) accused Activision Blizzard of “withholding and suppressing evidence” needed for its investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640302/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-update-withholding-info-expanded-victims"&gt;in an amended complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;walked out in protest&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s initial public response to the lawsuit in July. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch League cancels its in-person playoff events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch League" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q2CfIQRqpKfsNROLy2jW5y2NsrE=/0x0:9000x6000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779959/121639_S3W5D1_TorontoDefiantVsAtlantaReign_Stewart_VollandB.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DTUhZn"&gt;The 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631026/overwatch-league-fourth-season-overview-blizzard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League&lt;/a&gt; playoffs have hit a slight snag. Yesterday, the League announced it will no longer host live playoff matches in Dallas and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVo47P"&gt;“Due to significant changes in the environment affecting travel for some teams, we’ve decided to pivot away from originally scheduled live events in Dallas and Los Angeles,” the League wrote in a statement on Twitter. “Instead, postseason competition will return to Hawai’i for playoffs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vk1mW0"&gt;The move is likely in response to the COVID-19 delta variant surge that’s spreading across the globe and the diminishing ability for travelers to obtain visas to and from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtOKVj"&gt;Last season, the League split into two regions: North America and Asia Pacific, or APAC. Regular season play and the playoffs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"&gt;were sequestered within the regions&lt;/a&gt;, with each sending their top team to Korea to play in an online broadcast LAN grand final. This year, the League decided to introduce cross-regional play by sending qualifying NA teams to Hawaii. Dubbed “&lt;a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/videos/yyy_2l6aOirhdQI"&gt;Project Aloha&lt;/a&gt;,” the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League partnered with the University of Hawaii Manoa to provide facilities and support for visiting &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League teams to play against teams in Asia on servers designed to reduce game latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="607NUr"&gt;While Project Aloha was a great way to introduce cross-regional play — something the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League community greatly desired during the 2020 season — it wasn’t a perfect solution. Teams still had to travel to Hawaii, a problematic solution since COVID numbers are surging there and the governor is currently urging visitors to stay away. And though teams were playing on servers at as low a latency as possible, latency cannot be totally eliminated, affecting the quality of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruhtBG"&gt;After the announcement, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League players voiced their concerns on social media with some remarking that it was unfortunate because they believed the setup disadvantaged North American teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OKtzKd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;sucks that NA teams will be playing on a massive disadvantage again but not much u can do about this   &lt;a href="https://t.co/4q1nxGY6lt"&gt;https://t.co/4q1nxGY6lt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nero (@ow_nero) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow_nero/status/1430687870579183619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0GYFo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League why it decided to resume sending teams to Hawaii for games. A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed that visa difficulties and the constantly evolving situation with the delta variant necessitated a solution that reduced international travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5IP1F"&gt;Esports organizers are finding it increasingly difficult to plan live events as the world opens and shuts back down again due to the delta variant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638914/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-moved-china-europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legend&lt;/em&gt;s’ Worlds tournament &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s The International&lt;/a&gt; both made changes to their venues as countries restrict international travel and live event gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsuDG9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;League’s decision to abandon live events comes amid Blizzard’s continuing legal battles against the state of California for enabling harassment and discrimination. Earlier this week, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) accused Blizzard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640302/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-update-withholding-info-expanded-victims"&gt;“withholding and suppressing evidence.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Nzqd"&gt;The League is currently taking a short break as it prepares for the playoffs that begin on September 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUQ3sp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrDmOj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read the harrowing story of the world’s first CO2 pipeline explosion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside Saudi Aramco’s Hawiyah Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3KbFt08UOXrPlqsVgbxzXq9pus=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779800/1233713474.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Location sign for the ‘CO2 to pipeline’ apparatus at the Hawiyah Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plant, operated by Saudi Aramco, in Hawiyah, Saudi Arabia, on Monday, June 28, 2021.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zFL6Oj"&gt;Last year, a pipeline carrying compressed carbon dioxide mixed with hydrogen sulfide ruptured, engulfing the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, in a green haze, leaving many residents convulsing, confused, or unconscious. That explosion serves as a vivid&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;warning about the risks posed by what could be the next generation of pipelines to crisscross the US, in a new investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gassing-satartia-mississippi-co2-pipeline_n_60ddea9fe4b0ddef8b0ddc8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://climateinvestigations.org/"&gt;Climate Investigations Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wHc5s6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was almost like something you’d see in a zombie movie.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4gVIv"&gt;“It was almost like something you’d see in a zombie movie,” Sheriff’s Officer Terry Gann tells journalist Dan Zegart about what happened that night. Zegart pieces together the events of February 2020&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;through harrowing 911 calls and the voices of family members racing to reach others before the toxic haze could overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLaDLL"&gt;The story is a scathing investigation of the company, Denbury, that operates the pipeline, which did little to nothing to warn local officials and residents about the danger they faced, according to Zegart’s reporting. It’s also probably the closest thing to a PSA on the risks other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities could face if proposals to build out tens of thousands of miles of CO2 pipelines come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cbbtjc"&gt;CO2 is the most high-profile greenhouse gas driving the global climate crisis. To keep CO2 from doing its damage in the atmosphere, some lawmakers and big green groups are pushing for new technology to capture carbon dioxide from the air or from smokestack emissions. That captured carbon dioxide would ultimately need to be transported to places where it can be stored underground. It’s an idea that’s gained so much steam recently that the bipartisan infrastructure package making its way through Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;includes billions of dollars to develop the technology and the network of pipelines&lt;/a&gt; that would come with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59jUy4"&gt;Fossil fuel companies are also big backers of carbon capture technologies, selling it as a way for them to clean up their emissions while still selling oil and gas products responsible for climate change. They already move and use concentrated CO2 in a process called enhanced oil recovery: they shoot CO2 into the ground to help them extract more from their wells. The Denbury pipeline that exploded was transporting CO2 for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aPVz3h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CO2 might sound harmless — but at high concentrations, it’s an asphyxiant&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0Lpf5"&gt;Despite the growing support for carbon capture, there’s not a lot of information out there for the public about what this proposed new infrastructure could mean for communities like Satartia. None of the residents Zegart spoke to had heard about plans to build more CO2 pipelines across the country — even as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDRhM7tBWWI"&gt;officials eye&lt;/a&gt; the Gulf region as a potential hub for carbon capture in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HVPuQ"&gt;CO2 might sound harmless — it’s in the air we breathe, after all — but at high concentrations, it’s an asphyxiant. Did you know that CO2 accidents kill around 100 workers globally each year? I did not, and I report on this kind of stuff for a living. What happened in Satartia is the world’s first known example of mass outdoor exposure to piped CO2, according to the World Health Organization’s Climate Change and Environmental Determinants of Health Unit. It might not be its last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHMk3L"&gt;To learn more, read Zegart’s reporting in &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gassing-satartia-mississippi-co2-pipeline_n_60ddea9fe4b0ddef8b0ddc8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and hold on, this story is a nail-biter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro is building a factory and test track in Nevada for its autonomous delivery robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y_WwpIcWTzDfc4eXkAhkMkt2Ljs=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779727/nuro_r2_05_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nuro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xn2YHw"&gt;Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup founded by two ex-Google engineers, announced a dramatic expansion of its physical footprint. The company said it will spend $40 million on the construction of a manufacturing facility and test track for its fleet of self-driving robot vehicles. Both facilities will be located in Southern Nevada, which in recent years has become a hotbed for manufacturing and testing for the future of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1oZbM"&gt;Nuro, which is valued at $5 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;was founded in 2016 by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, two veterans of the Google self-driving car project that would go on to become Waymo. It is one of the few companies to be operating fully driverless vehicles — that is, vehicles without safety drivers behind the wheel — on public roads today. Its R2 vehicle is about half as wide as a compact sedan, shorter than most cars, and there’s no room inside for human passengers or drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="phOA5U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company plans on producing its third-generation vehicle at its Nevada facility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bg0IiV"&gt;The R2 is an updated version of Nuro’s original R1 prototype, with around 50 percent more capacity (which translates into about 18 more grocery bags). The company plans on producing its third-generation vehicle at its Nevada facility once it is fully operational in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDZoWCbI-JV9aGXP7QoogOYIQM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22807074/Nuro_Manufacturing_Site.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nuro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuro’s new manufacturing facility will include 125,000 square feet of space and 80 acres of property development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U5Suvh"&gt;The new 125,000-square-foot factory will have the capacity to build “tens of thousands of delivery vehicles,” Nuro says. The vehicle’s powertrain, which includes the electric motor and battery, will be made in the US by BYD, a Chinese company that is one of the largest manufacturers of electric vehicles in the world. Nuro says it will develop all the autonomous software and digital infrastructure “from United States-based servers to ensure safety and privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D6kFQr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nuro says its $40 million investment will translate into $2.2 billion of “economic impact”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPuZEC"&gt;Nuro says its $40 million investment will translate into $2.2 billion of “economic impact” for Nevada within 10 years and will result in the creation of 250 jobs. In April, the &lt;a href="http://rgj.com/story/news/money/business/2021/04/02/nevada-office-economic-development-approves-tax-incentives-9-companies/4839753001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reno Gazette Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Nuro will receive $170,519 in tax abatements over 10 years from Clark County. In exchange for the tax break, the company will create about 60 jobs within five years at an average wage of $28.80 per hour, the paper reported. The company also applied last September to receive an estimated $500,000 in tax abatements over a 10-year period from the Nevada Governor’s Economic Development Board, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtKCdK"&gt;Once the company’s manufacturing facility is up and running, Nuro will need a closed course to test and validate its vehicles safely. (As an example, Waymo uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579180/waymo-self-driving-test-facility-castle-google"&gt;a former Air Force base in central California&lt;/a&gt; which it originally leased in 2012.) Nuro said it is “taking over” 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway to build a “world-class, closed-course testing facility that will allow sophisticated development and validation of its autonomous on-road vehicles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQoJIc"&gt;According to a spokesperson, Nuro will takeover the entire speedway for its testing facility. The race track was closed in November 2020 for COVID restrictions but has since been &lt;a href="https://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/las-vegas-motor-speedway-plans-100-capacity-as-clark-county-lifts-capacity-restrictions/article_e277c48a-b847-11eb-9ad4-7b3ec4e7427b.html"&gt;reopened for events&lt;/a&gt;. The South Point 400 race is currently scheduled for September 24th-26th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuro is taking over 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for its test track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3uFnWd"&gt;The test track is also expected to be operational by 2022, at which point Nuro plans on putting its driverless robots through a battery of tests, including “avoiding pedestrians and pets to giving bicycles space on shared roadways, as well as environmental tests and vehicle systems validation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BLZcKu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a significant moment for Nuro”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxwLpi"&gt;“This is a significant moment for Nuro,” said Zhu, Nuro’s co-founder and CEO, in a statement. “Building on our tremendous momentum—including strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as Domino’s, Kroger, and FedEx and operations in three states—we are now able to invest in the infrastructure to build tens of thousands of robots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwtnNp"&gt;The company is relatively unknown compared to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space, mostly because of its focus on delivery and not ferrying human passengers in robotaxis. Still, Nuro has made incredible progress on the regulatory front, becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125358/nuro-self-driving-delivery-robot-r2-fmvss-exemption"&gt;the first company to receive a special exemption from certain federal safety requirements&lt;/a&gt; and recently getting the green light to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;charge money for its deliveries in California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Sheets’ formula suggestions are like autofill for math</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnKgNeLunmRVzdw1txm45CsKe4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779701/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yfRLqw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/intelligent-formula-and-function-suggestions-in-google-sheets.html"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Google Sheets is getting the ability to intelligently suggest formulas and functions for your spreadsheet, based on the data you're trying to analyze. For example, typing “=” into a cell below a list of numbers will pop up a box that lets you automatically add the numbers together, find their average, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxOJ9N"&gt;From my admittedly simple tests, it seems to be a pretty smart system. For example, with one column of data, it suggested that I could be looking for either the sum or average of the numbers. After I chose the sum and moved down to the next cell, it only suggested finding the average for the same range of numbers, not including the sum I’d just calculated. It’s a simple thing, keeping track of what’s data and what’s analysis, but it’s easy to imagine a version of this that gets tripped up on that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyyvHECMCv51G2VY57PqDx-sBOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806070/Sheets_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqqP6y"&gt;Google says that to create these suggestions, it trained a machine learning model using anonymized data from certain spreadsheets. The model doesn’t just take how often certain formulas are used into account, though — it also looks at the context within sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5ZxoT"&gt;For example, as you can see in the GIF above, I had one row labeled as “Total,” and the system only suggested the sum formula. After I removed the “Total” label, it suggested both sum and average. Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it can also identify headers and look at how data is grouped to get an idea of what suggestions to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRpqjP"&gt;Spreadsheet programs have long tried to make their users’ lives easier with autocomplete features. For example, both Sheets and Excel feature a sort of series continuation feature, where it’ll try to detect what you’re doing in a selected range and then continuing it. For example, if I’ve got a list that goes 2, 4, 6, I can tell Sheets to continue that for a bunch of cells, and it’ll auto-populate the next cells with 8, 10, 12, etc. While these existing systems are definitely timesavers, it’d be a stretch to call them “intelligent” — you don’t have to use them much before you find something that they misinterpret. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDZCGVMmucEfp1XLXVQKRv1R99U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806131/autofill_2_opt.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with the basics, but falls down with curveballs (or Fibonacci sequences). Still a great life hack, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RORzvD"&gt;While Google’s intelligent function and formula suggestions aren’t as impressive as, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;Github’s Copilot tool that autocompletes code&lt;/a&gt;, they both represent tech’s ability to smooth over the mundane time sucks that take up more time than we’d probably realize. Is it particularly difficult to, say, type out “SUM” then select the range I want? No. Is it great to have the program just do it for me, as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21315189/gmail-ai-smart-reply-compose-tools-enable-turn-on-how-to"&gt;can with email replies&lt;/a&gt; and Python functions, letting me get on with whatever it is that I need to use my human brain for? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31AfVA"&gt;According to Google’s blog, the feature started rolling out to Workspace, G Suite, and personal Google accounts on Wednesday and will take up to 15 days to show up for everyone. The feature can also be turned off if you’re not fond of the pop-ups. Google also says that the rollout will provide “users with visibility into whether previously compiled formulas need further verification.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panasonic photoshopped a white man’s head onto a Black man’s body</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMF0MPWvLZwHfHqWsLLMyykN2eM=/287x0:7714x4951/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779333/GN01_CUT06_210728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJZKj0"&gt;We recently wrote how Panasonic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/8/25/22641563/panasonic-soundslayer-wigss-wireless-gaming-speaker-sc-gn01-price-release-date-specs"&gt;maybe went &lt;em&gt;a little &lt;/em&gt;overboard with wacky promotional images for its new SoundSlayer wearable gaming speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Fun, right? Here’s something less amusing: it appears that Panasonic couldn’t be bothered to take actual photos of its product on actual human beings, so it digitally inserted them into royalty-free pictures from Shutterstock and Getty Images. And then, it appears to have done something worse: stick a white man’s head on a Black man’s body, altering his skin tone to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZpWHL"&gt;Let’s start with the less egregious example. Here’s Panasonic’s image of its headset blowing a gamer’s mind:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5jkK23at9eHn3kMFx5ou4QVko5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805194/panasonic_sc_gn01_wearable_immersive_gaming_speaker_wigss_2200.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P94ba3"&gt;If you type “nerdy gamer” into Shutterstock, it’s the &lt;em&gt;very first result&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BvvXo2PUsO0KdkpaRcg3Tz9iXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805866/1405_2021_08_25_1405_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ehxgrc"&gt;There’s no question &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Fimage-photo%2Fnerdy-gamer-controller-329959085&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this image from Lasse Behnke&lt;/a&gt; is the one Panasonic used — but the model sure isn’t wearing a Panasonic neck speaker. (It’s also not clear why the DualShock 4’s light bar has been edited out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AtOEw"&gt;Okay, now for the ugly one. First, the image Panasonic provided alongside its new product, and below it, the original photo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAeMHSvtGdoKttVidzM0U11G-Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805328/GN01_CUT06_210728.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8uXgMbWkAqqsHMbHI-uRLDb7P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805886/gettyimages_1210346459_2048x2048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fdetail%2Fphoto%2Fplaying-video-games-royalty-free-image%2F1210346459&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;blackCAT (Getty Images)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Young African American man eating pizza, drinking beer and playing video games.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6bGsBj"&gt;These might look like very different people, but that’s the editing at work — they clearly have the same hands, the same shirt (with the same exact creases), the same arm definition, and the same throat, in the same posture. Someone took the Black man’s body, stuck a white man’s head on top, lightened his skin, and changed the color of his game controller and his shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8FDkqR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a quick juxtaposition to make it even clearer: this Black man's head was digitally replaced. &lt;a href="https://t.co/X8Ac1IlDu6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/X8Ac1IlDu6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1430943826424647685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kEYcfT"&gt;Whose head is on whose body, though? There’s little question that it was the Black man whose identity got erased, instead of the other way around. I took a look at the EXIF data in Panasonic’s picture, and it reads: “Young African American man eating pizza, drinking beer and playing video games.” Not only is that the exact title of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fdetail%2Fphoto%2Fplaying-video-games-royalty-free-image%2F1210346459&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Getty Image above&lt;/a&gt;, the EXIF also mentions Getty Images and photographer blackCAT, and so it’s &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;likely Panasonic started with the Black man’s photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0QpBM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why, Panasonic, why?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1dyG3o"&gt;It’s less clear whether anything would actually prohibit Panasonic from modifying the images in this way, or whether the original photographers and models have any say at all — when you buy a royalty-free image on these platforms, you buy the ability to freely use and modify it, without having to negotiate with the artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieVVUB"&gt;And while Shutterstock’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Flicense&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;license agreement does say&lt;/a&gt; customers may not “Portray any person depicted in Visual Content (a “Model”) in a way that a reasonable person would find offensive,” Getty Images &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Feula&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;doesn’t seem to have&lt;/a&gt; any similar terms. Getty’s restrictions are primarily around “editorial” content, so that journalists’ photos of real-world news events aren’t used in advertising or endorsements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sU7FR"&gt;After we brought these images to Panasonic’s attention yesterday afternoon, it pulled every promo image featuring a human being from its image distribution folder for this product. As of this morning, a representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s still looking into the matter but didn’t offer a timetable for a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtTWoW"&gt;It’s not the first time a tech company has replaced a Black man’s head with a white one in a promotional image, by the way: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/aug/26/microsoft-race-gaffe"&gt;Microsoft was caught doing it on its Polish website in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will take a smaller cut of publishers’ sales if they join Apple News</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple News on a MacBook and iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbenwCYxz6C6cERjRNiXJFzkIAc=/95x0:1748x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779318/image__2_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e7ktH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-introduces-the-news-partner-program/"&gt;has a new offer for publishers&lt;/a&gt;: join Apple News, and it’ll only take 15 percent out of your in-app purchases and subscriptions instead of 30. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/"&gt;Publishers can apply to Apple’s News Partner Program&lt;/a&gt; to take that bargain, but they have to agree to Apple’s requirements, which naturally benefit Apple and go beyond just maintaining a channel in Apple News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAVW3L"&gt;The list of specific eligibility requirements to apply is short but worth sharing in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="re918R"&gt;You must maintain a robust Apple News channel in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and publish all content to that channel in Apple News Format. If you’re based outside of these regions and do not publish in Apple News Format, you must share content via an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABvMvR"&gt;The primary function of your app must be to deliver original, professionally-authored news content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRF37b"&gt;Your app must be available on the App Store and allow users to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAbIAM"&gt;The Account Holder of an Apple Developer Program membership must agree to a separate addendum to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DVrn3S"&gt;So publishers are expected to maintain their Apple News channel, publish in the Apple News Format (ANF), and offer an app in the App Store that offers auto-renewable subscriptions and only “original, professionally-authored news content.” Apple says the News Partner Program will also support and fund organizations that educate readers on news media literacy and “further efforts to diversify newsrooms and news coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvrIdQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A dramatic reduction in fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJq28u"&gt;It’s extra work to maintain an app and publish in an entirely separate, proprietary format, but based on what Apple reportedly asked of publishers in the past, this might be a welcome reprieve. Apple traditionally takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules"&gt;a 30 percent commission on in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; that drops to 15 percent after a year, but before Apple News launched, rumors suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222281/apple-news-subscription-service-50-percent-cut-publishers-media-deal"&gt;Apple was asking publishers for 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, news publishers weren’t very happy about that, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21378156/apple-news-publishers-subscription-deal-app-store-cut-terms-amazon-letter"&gt;once they found out Amazon got special treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VyJQr"&gt;After the rough treatment, it’s not clear if the News Partner Program will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307242/apple-news-new-york-times-app-not-available-free-articles-subscription"&gt;entice former publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; There’s also the consideration of how this looks considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; in which Apple is currently embroiled in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and abroad&lt;/a&gt;. But the company hasn’t exactly been one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;to consider the optics of major business shifting decisions&lt;/a&gt; as of late, so maybe it’s hoping publishers won’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mvb5hj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Apple is making the antitrust case against it stronger ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/17/21292983/apple-spotify-antitrust-hey-email-congress-house-judiciary-tim-cook"},{"title":"What Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have at stake in the antitrust fight ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W5xKhC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated Apple wanted publishers to support news media literacy and diversity organizations as part of the News Partner Program. That’s incorrect, Apple will support those efforts. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix starts testing in-app games for users in Poland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DF9QXeXep7VsJZo-tjRni0qNfGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779254/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T05eJi"&gt;Netflix is taking its next step into gaming by allowing subscribers in Poland on Android to play two &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; games inside the Netflix app, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuQo9F"&gt;“Starting today, members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games — &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3&lt;/em&gt; — all as part of their membership,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s still very, very early days and we will be working hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app purchases approach to gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trgbLJ"&gt;You can see how it works &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixPL/status/1430895506427764762"&gt;in a tweet from Netflix’s Polish team&lt;/a&gt;. Available games will show up in your home feed. If you tap on a game’s icon, you can learn more about the game and tap a button to download it, which will load up the Google Play Store inside the Netflix app. From there, you can download the game, and when it’s ready, you can play it from Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enuJYn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let’s talk Netflix and gaming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games, Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3. It’s very, very early days and we’ve got a lot of work to do in the months ahead, but this is the first step. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r"&gt;https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcjdBd"&gt;The Netflix spokesperson clarified that games aren’t being streamed to your device — they are downloaded. And even though you are downloading the games to your device, you can only play them inside the Netflix app, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYIj85"&gt;In July, Netflix put some big stakes in the ground about its plans for gaming, hiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA and Oculus exec&lt;/a&gt; to lead the company’s gaming work and stating that its initial strategy would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;“primarily focused on games for mobile devices.”&lt;/a&gt; Games will also be included for free with users’ Netflix subscriptions — which is all setting up for the company to offer an Apple Arcade-like suite of mobile games available to Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oarEFb"&gt;This isn’t the first time Netflix has experimented with games. The streaming service offers interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17460092/netflix-interactive-games-minecraft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21175211/carmen-sandiego-to-steal-or-not-netflix-interactive-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;had several &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; projects&lt;/a&gt; in the works with Telltale, the makers of the hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896012/telltale-games-the-walking-dead-storytelling-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"&gt;before the studio collapsed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkBqjc"&gt;It’s unclear when Netflix subscribers outside of Poland or on different device platforms may be able to try the in-app mobile games. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s new AR features can identify the world around you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3cV-xBSIrMdCI8O9XSNkAZMrdKI=/0x0:1722x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779016/wreel_210825_4729_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Video still by Weston Reel for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The next generation of a feature called Scan can identify similar clothes, dog breeds, plants, cars, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9Hcci8"&gt;Snapchat’s camera has to date mostly been associated with sending disappearing messages and goofy AR effects, like a virtual dancing hot dog. But what if it did things for you, like suggest ways to make your videos look and sound better? Or show you a similar shirt based on the one you’re looking at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xUzMT"&gt;Starting Thursday, a feature called Scan is being upgraded and placed front and center in the app’s camera, letting it identify a range of things in the real world, like clothes or dog breeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRfOV2"&gt;Scan’s prominent placement in Snapchat means that the company is slowly becoming not just a messaging app, but a visual search engine. Scan also helps address a growing problem for Snapchat users: how to find the millions of AR effects, or Lenses, that are made by Snap’s creator community. With its ability to suggest Lenses based on what you’re looking at, Scan could bring more visibility to the Lenses people make, incentivizing them to keep making AR content for Snapchat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNZXg9"&gt;Visual search isn’t a new idea. In 2017, Google debuted Lens, allowing users to scan items through their phone camera and identify them using its vast index of search results. Lens is integrated in the Google Pixel phones and a number of other Android handsets, as well as baked into the main Google mobile app. Pinterest also has its own visual search feature called Lens that shows similar images based on what you scan in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gy4E3eSxayJv7yN12iupCGgLyDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805687/wreel_210825_4729_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video still by Weston Reel for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uopWY5"&gt;Even though Snap is playing catch-up, it arguably has a better shot at taking the idea of visual search mainstream. Since Snapchat opens to the camera, any change there has big implications for how its nearly 300 million daily users interact with the app. Snap says that more than 170 million people already use Scan at least once a month — that was before it was put front and center on the camera like it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NrGk8x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Long term, we see the camera doing a lot more than what it can do today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQhbwb"&gt;“We definitely think Scan will be one of the priorities for [Snapchat’s] camera going forward,” Eva Zhan, Snap’s head of camera product, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an exclusive interview. “Long term, we see the camera doing a lot more than what it can do today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFeH4"&gt;Snap first started work on Scan a few years ago after observing how Snapchat users embraced scanning profile QR codes as a way to add friends in the app. After initially working with Shazam to identify songs and Photomath to solve math problems through its camera, Snap added the ability to identify items available for sale on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLWFu4"&gt;This latest version of Scan, which Snap previewed at its developer conference earlier this year, adds detection for dog breeds, plants, wine, cars, and food nutrition info. The majority of Scan’s features are powered by other companies; the app Vivino is behind the wine scanning feature, for example. Soon Allrecipes will power a Scan feature that suggests recipes to make based on a specific food ingredient. Snap plans to keep adding more abilities to Scan over time using a mix of outside partners and what it builds in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI8eTx3hRjrlnjW2G1Z9vRj8a5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806109/J0773_Snap_Partner_Summit_2021_Screenshop_Scan_Press_Asset_Still_16x9_05152021_version_1120.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ywlsY3"&gt;Scan’s biggest new addition is a shopping feature that was built by Snap and aided by its recent acquisition of Screenshop, an app that lets you upload screenshots of clothing and shop for similar items. Scan can recommend similar clothes based on what you’re looking at and let you buy clothes you discover. Scan’s shopping feature will also soon be added to the camera roll section of Snapchat called Memories, letting people shop for clothes based on what they have saved from their camera or screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjgyW9"&gt;Another core pillar of Scan is what Snap calls camera shortcuts. It works by recommending a combo of a camera mode, soundtrack, and Lense. So if you point the camera at the sky, Lenses specifically designed to work with the sky will be shown alongside a song clip and color filter, letting you apply all the changes at once. According to Zhan, Snap is working to add camera shortcuts to its TikTok rival Spotlight, potentially letting the viewer of a video quickly jump into their camera with the same configuration used to create the video they just watched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuHLeQBr4hjVzWyVAozA75a4vog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806110/J0773_Snap_Partner_Summit_2021_Camera_Shortcuts_Scan_Press_Asset_GIF_16x9_05152021_version_1130.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iTV6cI"&gt;I found Scan’s camera shortcuts to be fun initially, but they are currently confined to only a few situations: shots of the sky, human feet, dogs, and dancing. Snap plans to expand the situations that camera shortcuts work in over time, and the integration with Spotlight shows how they could become a more integral part of the video creation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHmCFu"&gt;Snap wants Scan to be an important way that users discover AR lenses going forward. It recently started letting its AR creators tag their Lenses with relevant keywords that will help Scan suggest the right Lenses based on what the camera is observing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEULnQ-hFgWIonZmiBTnYmO-ebk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805726/wreel_210825_4729_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video still by Weston Reel for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkDD44"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After testing Scan, I found it to be hit or miss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0UUWzG"&gt;After testing the new Scan for the past couple of weeks, I found it to be hit or miss. There were many instances where Scan incorrectly identified things or didn’t work at all, like when it failed to recognize that there were clothes I was trying to get results for, and also times when it worked perfectly. Sometimes the suggested Lenses were relevant, and other times they were clearly not contextually recommended at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H5sjW"&gt;That said, Snap promises that Scan will get better over time, both in its ability to accurately identify things and with new categories of objects it can detect. No data from Scan is currently being used for ad targeting, but it’s easy to see how the feature could make money with more shopping or advertising tie-ins down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Anzm371v6dShjXssNLgI_z1HMns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530299/Spectacles_DonAllenIII_Portrait.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcBxkd"&gt;Scan gets more compelling in a future world with people wearing AR glasses, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;the latest Snap Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. For me, it doesn’t feel natural to point my phone at things in the real world as a way to identify them, but the behavior makes more sense if I’m wearing smart glasses that can scan my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em1gT3"&gt;Snap already anticipates this: the new Spectacles have a dedicated Scan button on the frame that triggers Lenses based on what the wearer is viewing. (The new Spectacles aren’t available for sale. Instead Snap is giving them to select AR creators and partners who apply for access.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BkoDXm"&gt;While Scan is fairly bare-bones now, it shows how Snap is evolving the use cases for the camera. Snap sees Scan as an important part of Spectacles — and potentially other cameras — going forward, according to Zhan. “We definitely don’t want to limit Scan to just the Snapchat camera.”&lt;/p&gt;
