    <title>Microsoft’s Qualcomm exclusivity deal for Windows on Arm reportedly ending soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBI5pg2qxhJd28XoiXRsVuekG0o=/0x3:2239x1496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181604/Windows_10_ARM_Microsoft_Qualcomm.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fXIRW"&gt;Qualcomm reportedly has an exclusivity deal with Microsoft for Windows on Arm licenses. The pair launched Windows on Arm laptops in 2016, and so far we haven’t seen any devices launch without a Qualcomm chip. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-exclusivity-deal-microsoft-windows-on-arm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm has had an exclusivity deal on Windows on Arm, but that it’s set to expire soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFA1FO"&gt;The report comes days after MediaTek held its executive summit with members of the media last week, where it shared its ambitions to build its own chip for Windows on Arm PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlACLx"&gt;If Microsoft’s exclusivity deal is about to end with Qualcomm, this could open the door for many more vendors supporting Windows on Arm. Samsung, MediaTek, and even Apple’s M1 chips could eventually support Windows on Arm. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s custom SQ1 Qualcomm chip for the Surface Pro X (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgXxix"&gt;While you can run Windows on Apple’s M1 Macs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383598/parallels-desktop-mac-windows-10-install-m1-macbook"&gt;through Parallels Desktop&lt;/a&gt; virtual machine software, Apple does not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;support Boot Camp on M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft only licenses the Arm version of Windows to PC makers. Whether or not Microsoft would license Windows on Arm to Apple, or Apple would support such a scenario remains to be seen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLUuk5"&gt;Microsoft has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;working on designing its own Arm-based processors&lt;/a&gt; for servers and possibly future Surface devices. The software giant started work on these new chips more than a year ago, and reports suggest they’ll be used primarily in servers for Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dER52U"&gt;Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup runs on Intel chips. Microsoft did break from tradition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs"&gt;work with AMD and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; for custom chips for its Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X devices. There are &lt;a href="https://www.clien.net/service/board/park/16536544"&gt;even rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is also working with AMD on Arm-based laptop processors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung set to announce new $17 billion advanced chip plant in Texas: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBUCPU5l1Q0c3l15iyH4zLxXNW4=/0x0:694x463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181590/main_visual1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung already has a presence in Austin, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ll0b4Z"&gt;Samsung is expected to officially announce a new advanced chip-making plant in Texas later today, that’s estimated to cost around $17 billion and could create 1,800 jobs, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-to-choose-taylor-texas-for-17-billion-chipmaking-factory-11637627613"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The new plant will reportedly be located in the city of Taylor, roughly 30 miles away from Austin, where Samsung has an existing facility. The new site is roughly 1,200 acres in size, making it larger than Samsung’s Austin plant, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZCnLJ"&gt;The announcement could come as soon as 5pm local time today, when Gov. Greg Abbott is due to make an “economic announcement.” However, the plant isn’t expected to actually start producing chips until the end of 2024, according to previous filings. Eventually, Samsung is expected to begin using the new plant to produce processors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226849/samsung-exynos-2100-chip-processor-galaxy-s21-international"&gt;for its own uses&lt;/a&gt; and for use in other companies’ products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umagtU"&gt;The city of Taylor specifically has also offered Samsung incentives to locate its plant there, which reportedly amount to property tax breaks of over 90 percent for its first ten years, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UvNy1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company has declined to comment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gIR3sT"&gt;Samsung is a giant in the memory chip manufacturing game, but it’ll likely use the Taylor plant to manufacture advanced chips for other companies based on their designs. Previous reports have indicated this new plant could produce chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243994/samsung-chipmaking-texas-plant-3nm-10-billion-report"&gt;as advanced as 3nm&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung has previously produced chips for companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RizEjX"&gt;The company declined to comment to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; on its report, noting only that “a final decision has not yet been made regarding the location.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nT1t5"&gt;The expansion comes as the global semiconductor shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;continues to cause major problems&lt;/a&gt; for everyone from console makes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;car manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a situation that’s unlikely to abate until at least 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;recent comments from Intel CEO&lt;/a&gt; Pat Gelsinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDt1nd"&gt;In response, the Biden administration is attempting to bolster US chip production, reducing the potential for supply chain disruption and reversing the country’s declining share of manufacturing in recent decades. The Senate recently approved $52 billion in subsidies for new chipmaking plants, though the CHIPS Act is yet to pass in the House of Representatives, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/samsung-is-said-to-pick-texas-site-for-advanced-u-s-chip-plant?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmx8s"&gt;The chip-making industry has production capacity increases planned, but many of the new plants won’t be online anytime soon. TSMC and Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772167/tsmc-sony-semiconductor-fab-factory-japan-2024-7-billion"&gt;new $7 billion chip factory in Japan&lt;/a&gt; won’t see production start until the end of 2024, the same year as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;TSMC’s new $12 billion Arizona plant&lt;/a&gt;. TSMC has said it plans to invest over $100 billion in new chip factories over the next three years, while Intel plans to spend a similar amount over the next decade on investments in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new emoji are now available in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4e-dOymptyXTzqc4j12rDzUhdy0=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181570/WindowsBlog_EmojiHero_1600x1067.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpVMne"&gt;Microsoft is making its Fluent-style emoji available in Windows 11 this week. A new optional update for the OS &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/11/22/express-yourself-with-new-emoji-now-available-in-windows-11/"&gt;is rolling out&lt;/a&gt; that includes a number of important bug fixes and the new emoji &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578352/microsoft-new-3d-emoji-clippy-windows-office"&gt;Microsoft previewed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s a totally new style, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727850/microsoft-windows-11-new-emoji-not-3d"&gt;it’s not the 3D look&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft previously promised — the company opted for 2D instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiNdIS"&gt;The new emoji in Windows 11 includes the return of Clippy, as Microsoft has replaced the standard paperclip emoji with its Clippy character. The emoji have also been redesigned to include bright and saturated colors, but lack the 3D aspects that made them pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5qOki"&gt;“The new emoji style is only available in Windows 11 and is 2D,” explains Microsoft in a quiet update to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/emotionality-at-work-398182387adc"&gt;its design blog from July&lt;/a&gt;. “We still offer an assortment of emojis [sic] for Windows 10 customers.” This same blog post still points out that Microsoft “opted for 3D designs over 2D and chose to animate the majority of our emoji.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_uBgYKN7Ph3zXyASX2LtJ4Nv7CQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928947/GcHxn3A.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji was supposed to be more 3D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jooM9X"&gt;It’s not clear if we’ll ever see the impressive 3D emoji inside Windows 11 that Microsoft demonstrated earlier this year. The lack of 3D could be related to technical limitations of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directwrite/color-fonts"&gt;Microsoft’s color font format&lt;/a&gt; that the company uses to display emoji inside Windows. While Apple uses bitmaps to render its emoji, Microsoft uses a vector format which is far more scalable and has file size benefits if emoji are flatter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHDlzl"&gt;We’re still expecting 3D and animated versions of these Fluent emoji to appear in products like Microsoft Teams, but if you want the new emoji in Windows then you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 11. Microsoft has made it clear that it doesn’t plan on bringing this new emoji to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wooting Two HE review: an analog keyboard in a digital world </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ecosystem isn’t quite ready&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Qm6zd3"&gt;Like most PC gamers, I split my time between playing using a mouse and keyboard and a console controller. Nothing beats the precision of a mouse in first- and third-person shooters, but for me, a keyboard is no match for an analog stick in racing games or platformers. They both have different strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Z5ZT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wooting_two_he"&gt;Wooting’s Two HE keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $174.99 without keycaps, is the company’s latest attempt to bridge that gap, offering some of the benefits of analog control in the form factor of a keyboard. This time around, it achieves this with Gateron-manufactured “Lekker” switches, which use magnetic Hall effect sensors rather than typical metal contacts to detect when they’ve been pressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0bG2D"&gt;It’s an interesting idea, and Wooting has more or less nailed its implementation, with a design and software that makes setting up this unusual form factor relatively painless. But in practice, I found that a lot of PC games end up getting confused by this unusual keyboard’s analog controls, which limits their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84nBzj"&gt;A quick note on availability: Wooting doesn’t currently have any Two HEs available to ship immediately and lists the Wooting Two HE as being available for preorder. The next US batch is due to ship in April 2022, while in Europe, there is a small number available that’ll ship in December, with the rest expected to also ship in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lu0jam"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10880485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GDDcoO"&gt;The central feature of the Wooting Two HE is its custom Lekker switches, which are what allow it to offer analog controls. Unlike traditional Cherry MX switches, which use metal contacts to register a keypress, Wooting’s switches have small magnets in their stems and a Hall effect sensor in their circuit board that can sense when it moves. So while Cherry MX-style switches only have two states (pressed or not pressed), Wooting’s latest switches can detect gradients of a press of anywhere between 0.1mm and 4mm, aka the difference between lightly tapping a key or pushing it all the way down. This range of motion is also improved compared to the optical analog Flaretech switches used in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/1/11832654/wooting-analog-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter"&gt;Wooting One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootingtwo"&gt;original Wooting Two&lt;/a&gt;, which could only detect between 1.5mm and 3.6mm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLhMZc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Magnets, how do they work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGiwAX"&gt;Considering its unusual functionality, there’s nothing too unusual about the Wooting Two HE’s design. It uses a full-size layout including a numpad (currently available with US, UK, German, and Nordic layouts), features per-key RGB backlighting, and connects to a computer using a detachable USB-C cable. There are three channels for routing the cable out of the top of the keyboard, which is handy if you’d rather have it come out of the top left or top right of the board. Although the cable is nice and braided, the keyboard as a whole has a bit of a plastic feel to it that’s unbecoming of its higher-end price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2s6Jj"&gt;The Wooting Two HE starts at $174.99 without keycaps, but there are keycaps made from ABS plastic available in a bundle for $184.99 or more premium PBT keycaps for $194.99. Regardless of which you opt for, the keyboard currently doesn’t come with its keycaps preinstalled, meaning you have to manually install all 100-plus keycaps yourself. This kind of self-assembly might make sense when you’re buying your keyboard and keycaps from different places, but it feels odd when they come in the same box (Wooting tells me this won’t be the case for future US orders with PBT keycaps). I had no issues with the ABS keycaps that came with my review sample, but for just a $10 premium, I think it makes sense to step up to PBT, a plastic that generally has a reputation for being more durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8vpgZfTETKkUhaqwjwFwb9Ct8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006804/jporter_211111_4873_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An exposed Lekker switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6j0j1"&gt;The Wooting Two HE’s Lekker switches are also hot-swappable, so in theory, they can be easily removed from the board using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_extractor"&gt;IC extractors&lt;/a&gt; or other switch pullers (sold separately) and without the need for soldering. But this doesn’t matter a huge amount because, for now, at least, there aren’t any third-party compatible alternatives for you to swap in. Wooting includes four spare switches in the box with the keyboard, though, which should be helpful in case one of the switches breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZZcwx"&gt;Use the Wooting Two HE for everyday work, and it feels much like any other linear mechanical keyboard to type on. The Lekker switch’s design isn’t dissimilar to Cherry MX Reds, although weirdly, the typing sound almost reminds me of using a keyboard with Topre switches thanks to its slightly hollowed-out sound. The Cherry stabilizers do rattle, though, so be prepared to make some modifications if you’re sensitive to that sort of thing. It’s not the nicest keyboard I’ve ever typed on, but it’s functional enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KkQgxl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10880512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh2TuO"&gt;Naturally, things get a lot more interesting once you download &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootility"&gt;Wootility&lt;/a&gt;, Wooting’s companion software that’s available across Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s this that lets you get the most out of the keyboard’s analog switches, which it handles alongside other more traditional keyboard companion app tasks like setting up custom lighting schemes with the keyboard’s RGB backlighting or remapping its layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3j7UV"&gt;For starters, you can reprogram their “actuation point,” which is the distance they’re pressed down before a keypress is registered. This can be set anywhere from 0.1mm to 4mm. So if you’re a heavy typist prone to accidental keypresses, you might want to set up the keyboard so you have to press a key 3.5mm before it registers a press. Or, if you want the keyboard to feel as responsive as possible, you might set the actuation point to 0.5mm, so you barely have to touch the key before it actuates. These can even be set on a per-key basis. For what it’s worth, I left the keyboard set on a middle-of-the-road 2mm actuation point, which is similar to what Cherry uses for its standard MX Red switches. I’m a basic man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNKI8vjRoQ_qdk5eebwudWeQAUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006803/jporter_211111_4873_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The per-key RGB backlighting in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R0UXbu"&gt;Another piece of functionality enabled with analog switches is the Wooting Two HE’s rapid trigger technology. Unlike a traditional switch, which only deactivates once it’s released back to a specific reset point, the Lekker switches can deactivate the second the keyboard senses you’re lifting your finger up and can reactivate the moment you’re pushing your finger back down. In theory, this should make the keyboard feel more responsive, particularly in fast-paced games, but I couldn’t discern much of a difference in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BFKF6K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gamepad-style controls, on a keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GAaIC"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the Wooting Two HE, for me, was the possibility of remapping gamepad-style analog controls to the keyboard. Considering the slightly dizzying array of options at your disposal, Wooting’s software does a surprisingly good job at making this setup process simple and pain-free. For a first-person game, you might want to map the left analog stick’s up, left, down, and right motions to the W, A, S, and D keys, respectively. Or, for a racing game, it might make more sense to have a controller’s right and left triggers mapped to W and S while leaving the A and D keys to tilt a virtual left analog stick left and right. So long as a game supports either Xinput or DirectInput, it should work with the Wooting Two HE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf1Mvl"&gt;It’s possible to also map non-analog gamepad buttons like A, B, X, and Y to the Wooting Two HE, but in most cases, I found it less complicated to rely on regular keyboard controls for these other commands. So, for example, in &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding,&lt;/em&gt; I set WASD to emulate an analog stick but used regular keyboard controls for every other in-game action (you need to enable the “Enable Keyboards keys” toggle in Wootility for this to work). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hgofnC5RcmUkx3lqqZF7W1PHbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006805/jporter_211111_4873_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can switch between analog profiles using the shortcut buttons on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob5nfa"&gt;These control schemes are very specific to certain genres, so thankfully, it’s possible to save three analog profiles on the keyboard, and then you switch between them using the keyboard’s A1, A2, and A3 keys. You can also save additional profiles and swap them into one of these shortcut slots when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tNmu"&gt;That’s the theory, but in practice, it’s a bit more of a mixed bag. Initially, I thought that any games that rely on keyboard for movement and mouse for camera and aiming controls would be a great match for the Wooting Two HE. A mouse is indisputably more accurate for aiming, but a gamepad’s left analog stick offers more fine-grained movement. But the problem is that a lot of games simply aren’t set up to let you control movement using what is effectively an emulated gamepad, alongside a traditional mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPsxU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wooting’s software deals well with complexity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZqaDm"&gt;When trying to play &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;I found that the game refused to allow me to use a mouse for aiming while it thought I was moving with an analog stick. And I had a similar problem in &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&lt;/em&gt;. Wooting is aware of these issues, but unfortunately, it’s something that would need to be addressed by individual game developers to fix. Look out for games that support “&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Special:CargoQuery&amp;amp;tables=Infobox_game%2CInput&amp;amp;fields=Infobox_game._pageName%2CInfobox_game.Developers%2CInfobox_game.Publishers%2CInfobox_game.Released%2CInfobox_game.Available_on%2CInput.Simultaneous_input%3DSupported&amp;amp;where=Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27true%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27limited%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27hackable%27&amp;amp;join_on=Infobox_game._pageName%3DInput._pageName&amp;amp;order_by%5B0%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60_pageName%60&amp;amp;order_by%5B1%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Developers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B2%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Publishers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B3%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Released__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B4%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Available_on__full%60+&amp;amp;format=template&amp;amp;offset=100&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;named_args=yes&amp;amp;intro=%3Ctable+style%3D%22text-align%3A+center%3B+margin%3A+0+auto%3B+width%3A+auto%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-true%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENative+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Limited+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-limited%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ELimited+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Always+on+%28no+native+option%29%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-always-on%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3EAlways+on%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Hackable%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-hackable%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ERequires+manual+fix%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22No+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-false%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENo+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E%0A%3C%2Ftable%3E%0A%0A%3Cdiv+style%3D%22margin-top%3A10px%22%3E%3Ccenter%3ENative+support+may+require+selecting+certain+settings+in+the+game+or+launcher.+Refer+to+the+individual+game+pages+for+details.%3C%2Fcenter%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%0A%3Ctable+class%3D%22wikitable+sortable%22+style%3D%22width%3A+100%25%3Btext-align%3A+center%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A195px%3B%22%3EGame%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EDeveloper%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EPublisher%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ERelease+date%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ESystems%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+20px%3B%22%3ESupported%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E&amp;amp;template=Feature%2Frow&amp;amp;outro=%3C%2Ftable%3E"&gt;simultaneous input&lt;/a&gt;” if you want an indication that they’ll work with the Wooting Two HE, but be aware there are many out there where this won’t be an option without jumping through significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTQMBW"&gt;I had better luck with other titles. &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead 2 &lt;/em&gt;worked without any issues, as did the &lt;em&gt;Halo: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer beta and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, but unfortunately, none of these are games that benefit from being able to walk slowly. They’re pretty much designed for you to be running full-pelt at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umUQShPGZdyt1QFo-bhp1ruMV4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034688/wootility_lekker_beta_YGQr4swUO2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Wootility&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wooting’s software, featuring a keymap designed for racing games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKEZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps the game that most played into the Wooting Two HE’s strengths. Analog control is perfect for the kind of delicate touch the game asks of you as you maneuver Sam Porter Bridges, laden with gear and deliveries, over difficult terrain. The experience wasn’t perfect, however, because of the way the on-screen button prompts would flit between showing keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls depending on what input method it thought you were using with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CaYcZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; was a much bigger success because it saw me exclusively use the keyboard for control rather than using it alongside a mouse. Rather than using multiple small taps to try and smoothly turn the car, the Wooting Two HE let me half depress the A or D key to make a smooth turn, and I could also roll off the accelerator to try and recover from oversteer without having to either hit the brakes or stop accelerating entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pPSjna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many games were confused by the Wooting Two HE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i923M1"&gt;Despite the improvements, given the option, I’d still opt to play a racing game with a force-feedback-enabled controller or, even better, a full steering wheel. For the sake of balance, I tried racing with an Xbox One controller paired with my PC using Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapter, and I immediately felt more at home in &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing beats being able to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the car start to slide with your hands and then compensate accordingly, rather than having to look out for audiovisual cues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLw5KN"&gt;Maybe this is an unfair comparison. After all, Wooting doesn’t claim that its keyboard is capable of offering force feedback. But it highlights some of the drawbacks of a keyboard like the Two HE. In attempting to bridge the gap between a keyboard and a gamepad, it can end up feeling like a half measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWyTgp"&gt;I also ran into an annoying bug during my time with the keyboard. On more than one occasion, Windows refused to pick up the Wooting Two HE’s gamepad inputs at all. I could usually fix it by unplugging and then replugging the keyboard into my PC using USB or by following the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wooting.helpscoutdocs.com_article_38-2Danalog-2Dinput-2Dis-2Dnot-2Dworking&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=476jdkIgGUarAZOh8c7rGQ0y2cYvQOVP4r7SgCS1JPE&amp;amp;m=aIkdyzesyzqp1MsLS9Fxw5wrv2CcuyDmuVAW-yFFRbrTXlevOsPs7NDjDTA1t6HC&amp;amp;s=bP66pG50P7gnNfuNki_w7OyBcyGGPSiHRX1yVvQFib0&amp;amp;e="&gt;steps in Wooting’s troubleshooting guide&lt;/a&gt;, but it was far from seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRiG7WT5AWeyUuK9qPVN9vCfjeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006806/jporter_211111_4873_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wooting Two HE in a UK-ISO layout. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4Zs8v"&gt;The Wooting Two HE achieves more or less what it says it’ll achieve. Its keys are capable of registering analog inputs, and its software makes it easy to remap them to function as gamepad controls. It delivers on its promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4r0Wc"&gt;But its biggest problem is that it’s a niche product that most PC games aren’t designed to accommodate, and the result is that several of the titles I tried got confused when they sensed me using a gamepad and mouse simultaneously. That’s not the fault of Wooting, but ultimately, its keyboard is operating in an ecosystem that doesn’t recognize it exists. Meanwhile, the benefits of other features like an adjustable actuation point and more responsive keypresses are marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aBpRis"&gt;If you only want to use one peripheral for your PC gaming, then the Wooting Two HE is a much more flexible alternative than most regular keyboards. But I’d stop short of claiming it can match a traditional gamepad, and I think most people would be better off with having both peripherals in their arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony (update: sold out) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dW9VuHs1HV3u6Y639b430UlVQAk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180614/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony just got a restock of the PS5&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InjNmw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 22nd, 8:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw7TZO"&gt;If you’re still trying to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, lining up at Sony’s digital storefront is one of the more reliable ways to snag Sony’s next-gen console. Sony &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;has reopened the digital queue on its direct store&lt;/a&gt; to place orders for the $500 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the $400 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqKvo7"&gt;Provided you’ve already &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/ps5"&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; and logged into your PlayStation account, you should be able to line up once you’ve hit the landing page. Once you’ve entered the queue, you’ll be given an ETA of when you’ll be able to check out and, once that timer hits zero, it's all systems go. It's no secret that these consoles go quick and getting into the queue doesn’t necessarily guarantee a console, but Sony’s direct store remains one of the more reliable ways to get ahold of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI8v4N"&gt;If you’re still deliberating which console is the better fit for you, let's chat a little about the differences between these two consoles. Both models of the PS5, the standard model ($500) and the Digital Edition ($400), are virtually identical with the exception of the inclusion of a UHD Blu-Ray disc drive on the standard edition. Because it doesn’t have a disc drive, the Digital Edition is a little lighter and slimmer, but still features the same 825GB SSD. Both consoles are compatible with the same games, however,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is selling its Bluetooth tracking business to Life360 for $205 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple, Tile, and Samsung all offer smart Bluetooth trackers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaLxMRoUeTodLOxMiwLgqQ4HqGg=/291x146:1835x1175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180433/ajohnson_210702_4659_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me6qU1"&gt;Tile popularized marking items and tracking them from your phone with its small Bluetooth tags, but suddenly faces more competition from giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. The company that started out of an incubator &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/"&gt;and crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html"&gt;has announced it will be acquired by Life360&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself a “leading family safety platform.” The deal is valued at $205 million and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rxcai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscribers to Tile and Life360 services can expect  some new benefits in their packages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtvVv"&gt;Tile has developed its product line over the years with a variety of different trackers and partnerships with other companies to use its technology. It also has a subscription service, Tile Premium, with extra features, battery replacements, and insurance against potential losses. However, the game may have changed once Apple and Google started building their own item-locating features into iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Life360 app screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7nIpwT2b__Yr89DXqzICIXjBUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036284/life360_app.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360 app screenshots&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btPUOi"&gt;Life360 bills itself as an overall family safety app, with location sharing between family members, crash detection, and other features. Over the summer, it announced that it has over 1 million paying customers and reported its valuation had crossed $1 billion. It also acquired another item locating hardware startup, Jiobit, which makes cellular-connected trackers for kids and pets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYn9dH"&gt;Life360 expects the deal will increase the global footprint for both companies, Tile’s non-Bluetooth Finding Network, and create a larger combined subscriber base. Currently listed on the stock exchange in Australia, Life360 says it has plans for a “potential dual listing in the US” next year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

We’ll be bundling Tile devices as part of our Membership plans, and Tile will offer Life360 Membership benefits to its customers. We’ll also start work on integrating our technologies so Tile devices, Jiobit wearables, and Life360 app customers will show up on a unified map – people, pets, and things all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CG7WTI"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;launched the $29 AirTag earlier this yea&lt;/a&gt;r that also uses Bluetooth for tracking, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;adds precise Ultra Wideband tech and deep integration with the iOS platform&lt;/a&gt; that Tile just doesn’t have. And there are indications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540625/google-find-my-device-android-spot-location-network"&gt;Google won’t be left behind&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung launched its own pocket-sized Bluetooth trackers, and Amazon is building on Echo devices to enable tracking via the Sidewalk network (Tile announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags"&gt;a partnership with Amazon that began in June&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRA5R4"&gt;Tile recently announced its first ultra-wideband enabled tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;the Tile Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch next year and has the advantage of working with both mobile platforms to provide much more precise tracking. Still, as Tile vice president and general counsel Kirsten Daru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;said to Congress last year about Apple&lt;/a&gt;, “You might be the best soccer team, but you’re playing against a team that owns the stadium, the ball, and the league, and can change the rules when it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLurb"&gt;Hulls has a more optimistic vision of that reality in mind, as described in his blog post, pointing out that Apple’s introduction of AirPods expanded the market for all Bluetooth headsets much more than a single pioneer like Jawbone could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YVH9x"&gt;Tile says it will continue to operate as an independent entity with the same team, led by current CEO CJ Prober. Prober will join Life360’s board of directors and says in the announcement, “This acquisition not only brings together two incredible teams with complementary missions and values, it paves the way for us to jointly build the world’s leading solutions for peace of mind and safety. “&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku promises to fix issues with HBO, Netflix, and more caused by 10.5 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dFj3liDlncB00d2m13fxzB-bHE=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180825/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WMV7R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;Roku says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working to fix issues that users have been reporting following its 10.5 software update. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/roku-customers-report-streaming-issues-after-10-5-update/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the problems&lt;/a&gt; earlier on Monday, citing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/"&gt;posts on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/"&gt;Roku forums&lt;/a&gt; where users said that apps like HBO Max, ESPN, Disney Plus, and more wouldn’t allow them to watch any video content after updating the OS on their smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY9bcR"&gt;According to Roku, “certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players” are affected by the problematic update. &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;In a post on its forum&lt;/a&gt;, the company instructs users with Roku Ultra models 4660, 4661, 4662, or 4670, and users with a Roku TV model 7XXX to manually check for a software update, and tells owners of other devices to subscribe to the thread for future details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1X0PKK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;System update got you down? We're aware of a small set of users on older Roku TVs or Roku Ultra who are experiencing issues after the OS 10.5 release and are working quickly to resolve. See our realtime updates here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS"&gt;https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roku Support (@RokuSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kG9r8V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Roku has been having users roll back their OS to a previous version on a case-by-case basis, after the user contacts support with information about their devices. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qzyz5g/downgrade_from_105_to_100/"&gt;at least one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; has reported seeing a prompt to “upgrade” from 10.5 to 10.0, Roku doesn’t mention that it’ll be widely offering a downgrade in its posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s65mnG"&gt;While Roku users have also reported issues with streaming using the YouTube TV app, that particular issue doesn’t appear to be limited to just one platform — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-tv-has-been-freezing-up-on-smart-tvs-everywhere/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube TV users have been having issues across almost every device, from streaming boxes like Apple TVs, Amazon Fire sticks, and even Google’s own Chromecasts, to consoles and smart TVs (though it notes that iOS and Android users seem unaffected). YouTube’s support team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462134163872624649"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a fix for the issue on Roku devices, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking into the issue on other devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrpS6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry to hear about the trouble – we've seen similar reports of YouTube TV freezing intermittently, and our team is looking into the issue. Mind sharing what device (model) you're using, and if this is happening to all programs? Appreciate your patience in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AMWhOl"&gt;While it’s certainly odd that the two issues appear to be happening at the same time, they don’t seem to be related given that YouTube TV users are seeing freezes regardless of device. Thankfully, both companies appear to be working on ironing out the problems. Roku is actively updating its support post with instructions to check for updates, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that YouTube TV is getting fewer outage reports on DownDetector.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vozi16"&gt;While the fix for Roku users may solve their problems with Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, their YouTube TV troubles may not be over — Roku and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;are actively feuding&lt;/a&gt; over the YouTube TV not being available on the platform’s store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;Google has threatened&lt;/a&gt; to stop distributing its regular YouTube app on Rokus as well come December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgTd1mZd-FZpefnC-KfdRdsUAEo=/212x0:2497x1523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154121/LG_C1_Lifestyle_Photo.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;The store will continue to publish more deals as we get closer to the big day, with many of the better deals going live on November 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F3520-secaucus-nj%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent online circular&lt;/a&gt;. If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on doing your shopping, however, we’ll continue to update this page throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XIU118"&gt;Walmart is also discounting select sizes of the LG OLED A1 TV, selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-65-Class-4K-UHD-Smart-TV-OLED-A1-Series-OLED65A1PUA%2F572189714&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch&lt;/a&gt;, for example, for $1,497 instead of $2,500.

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes tells the jury that at least some of Theranos was real</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0e0HOu"&gt;So far, Elizabeth Holmes’ defense has been at pains to show us that Theranos had a real device and worked with real pharmaceutical companies. That actually hasn’t been in question, particularly in the time period the defense was asking about. Still, the point seems to be &lt;em&gt;hey, look, some things at Theranos were real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPQ2k9"&gt;But today, in her wire fraud trial, we saw a science-y presentation — not actual science, just the marketing version. We saw the guts of Theranos devices. We heard about the company iterating on the device. We saw emails with pharma companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Z2vO"&gt;Theranos’ work with drug companies was never in question; we saw money Theranos made from that work early in the prosecution’s case, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;comptroller Danise Yam&lt;/a&gt;. The issue with drug companies has been the “validation” reports that Theranos produced about its own technology in those partnerships. Though those reports were written by Theranos employees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;investors said&lt;/a&gt; they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;thought the reports&lt;/a&gt; had been written by the pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8mefs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWlRvr"&gt;Making matters worse, two reports we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;bore logos for Schering-Plough and Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;. The Schering-Plough memo had also been gussied up relative to its original version. When Theranos first sent the report to Schering-Plough, it did not have the pharma company’s logo on it, and read that Theranos “give accurate and precise results.” The version Walgreens saw had Schering-Plough’s logo and language that said “give more accurate and precise results… than current ‘gold standard’ reference methods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo9pdO"&gt;Investors testified that the work Theranos had done with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;pharmaceutical companies and the armed forces&lt;/a&gt; had been important. They thought that meant the drug companies and the Defense Department had co-signed the technology, using it on clinical trials and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/JQ8iFuWnlVuVFvduRrBp"&gt;in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; — a lie journalist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;Roger Parloff heard, too&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym8zJ5"&gt;Her testimony was brief — the trial was delayed an hour and a half for a meeting in the judge’s chambers between attorneys for the two sides. The reason for the meeting wasn’t explained. The court session also ended relatively early, at 1PM Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZqZOv"&gt;Holmes, who seemed at ease on the stand, was asked to explain why the cartridges on the Series 1.0 device didn’t work. They were stacked and held together with adhesive, but the adhesive could come loose, which let the stacked layers peel apart so they wouldn’t work properly. I wasn’t entirely sure why this would matter — we knew Theranos was iterating on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMDJKl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXAPS9"&gt;Her answers were largely non-technical; whether that was because she didn’t have technical knowledge, or because she wanted to make sure she wasn’t confusing the jury, wasn’t clear to me. At times, Holmes’ testimony hewed so closely to documents that we were being shown that it was funny. After reading emails, she’d be asked what they meant, and would respond with, nearly word-for-word, a sentence in the email. In a slideshow, one slide was titled “Completed Successes.” Holmes’ attorney, Kevin Downey, asked her what success meant in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg0fOh"&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program,” she replied. And when it came to Theranos’ performance? “I remember it being really good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExXfI"&gt;The “completed successes,” in Theranos’ parlance, were almost all preliminary drug company studies. One exception was a study done with Stanford, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4091290/"&gt;was actually published.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtjj2y"&gt;The outlines of the work with many drug companies were largely the same. A big drug company would do preliminary work with Theranos, which Holmes would typically characterize as successful. But no clinical trial work manifested. This was true for Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Celgene. Theranos did create tests for AstraZeneca and worked on a clinical trial for Centocor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oHnILI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuQb2F"&gt;In the Centocor trial, the Theranos device was tested against standard labs. Asked about how her device fared in comparison, Holmes said, “It performed well.”  Many of her answers were brief and matter-of-fact, as though she were discussing the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbWEsA"&gt;The most interesting parts of her testimony, however, had to do with Pfizer and Schering-Plough. Crucially, for Holmes to be found guilty of wire fraud, the government must show that she knew she was lying when she gave investors bad information — mistakes aren’t illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKE7Yj"&gt;So we saw some emails. At Schering-Plough, Constance Cullen had been Theranos’ main point of contact. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;Cullen testified earlier&lt;/a&gt;, for the prosecution.) As Cullen testified, her company was bought by Merck while she was in contact with Holmes, and since she was put in charge of a newly-combined group, work with Theranos fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl8D96"&gt;In an email from a Theranos employee to Holmes, the employee wrote that Cullen was swamped with work from the acquisition. “All in all it was awesome,” the email went on. “I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…” Holmes was asked directly if Cullen informed her of Schering-Plough’s low opinion of Theranos’ tests. Holmes said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q63jnp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqchN"&gt;You can see where this is going — a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;generous read of the situation is that Holmes didn’t realize the technology was bad or that Merck didn’t want to work with her, she just thought that her contact dropped the ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9EXwl"&gt;As for Pfizer, the defense produced emails that showed Holmes had continued talking to the company about a partnership as late as 2015. In that email, a Pfizer employee proposed using Theranos’ Walgreens centers as clinical trial sites. This did not come to fruition, and Thearnos didn’t work on a clinical trial for Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO25d2"&gt;It is possible to believe that all these drug companies looked into Theranos’ device and chose not to move forward for unrelated reasons  — but that’s a big stretch. Put together, we’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvZCqK"&gt;The thing about today’s presentation, though, is that Theranos’ early work isn’t contested. According to the government, the fraud didn’t start until later. Besides, liars don’t lie &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="L11i8Z"&gt;As she gets closer to testifying about some of the other areas of interest, though, I hope there’s just as much contemporaneous email evidence. Because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;having now heard Parloff’s tapes of Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by how confidently she’d lied and how believable she sounded. Being preceded by those tapes means that no matter how confident or trustworthy she sounds, I still find myself doubting what she says unless there’s something else to confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will pay $5.3 million to San Francisco to settle allegations over benefits violations</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwB5Xm"&gt;Food delivery platform &lt;a href="https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2021/11/22/san-francisco-secures-over-5-million-settlement-for-doordash-workers/"&gt;DoorDash has agreed&lt;/a&gt; to pay $5.3 million to the city of San Francisco to settle allegations it failed to provide healthcare and paid sick leave to some 4,500 delivery drivers, as the city requires. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, most of which will be used to reimburse drivers who made deliveries in the city between 2016 and 2020, before a new state law covering gig workers took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ICKaI"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;voters approved in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as ballot measure Proposition 22, allows companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to treat workers as independent contractors, not employees. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;judge ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that the law was unconstitutional, but it remains in effect pending an appeal by the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3brQHp"&gt;“We believe (DoorDash couriers) were misclassified and should have been employees for years,” San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu told the &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/DoorDash-to-pay-5-3-million-to-S-F-couriers-16636498.ph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was first to report the news Monday. “That is not part of the settlement but it is the perspective of the city.” As part of the settlement announced Monday, most drivers will get between $500 and $1,000, and the Chronicle reported that both sides agreed to the settlement to avoid a prolonged court battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERyhcR"&gt;“We are proud of the flexible earning opportunities and meaningful benefits and protections Proposition 22 affords Dashers across California,” DoorDash spokeswoman Briana Megid said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While we deny any wrongdoing, we feel that this settlement represents a fair compromise that will allow us to focus on continuing to provide the best experience for Dashers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVBHsz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
