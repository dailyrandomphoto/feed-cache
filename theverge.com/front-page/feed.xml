    <title>A brief chat with Storymodebae</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ePyoeJLEir9nwz1TBHG-3JyRp0=/0x0:1287x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672864/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_5.20.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRWxWS"&gt;Briana became &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/storymodebae"&gt;Storymodebae&lt;/a&gt; when she started her Twitch channel in January 2018. Back then she was still a year away from graduating from college, and in her own words, got the idea to start making things online after she started watching Let’s Plays on YouTube when she found herself stuck in games. “I was like, ‘I mean, I like playing video games and I think I can crack a joke on occasion. So maybe I should give this a try.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwHMRg"&gt;Three years later, Storymodebae has made Twitch her full-time career — though she’s still understandably a little nervous about putting her full name online. (“You know, I don’t put the government out there,” she jokes.) Last year, Storymodebae hosted three shows for Twitch — &lt;em&gt;This is Dope&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Follow Fridays&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Weekly — &lt;/em&gt;and also live concert shows for Live Nation. Her come up has been a wonderful thing to see: she’s a very visible Black woman in a scene dominated by white guys, and her streams are &lt;em&gt;fun &lt;/em&gt;to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zadzd4"&gt;And that’s kind of the reason she started in the first place. “I decided that I wanted to start streaming because I would look for Let’s Plays and things like that, but I didn’t see a whole lot of people that looked like me,” she says. “I saw Black men on YouTube. But as far as Black women, it’s like you have to type in “Black girl gamers” or these specific keywords so you could kind of find your tribe and find your people.” So she gave it a shot herself. “And it kind of turned into all of this. It started as a hobby, and now it’s the whole career.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Af4ap"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BitterOddHerdTTours&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RqEx3"&gt;Today, when she’s not hosting shows, you can find Briana &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/storymodebae"&gt;live on her own channel&lt;/a&gt;, where she mostly plays single-player games. “I focus on story based games. That’s where Storymodebae came from,” she says. Though lately she says she’s felt at a loss for finding new games to play. “It’s like, the last game I was really excited about was &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;. And then I thought I was gonna be excited about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;. And I wasn’t.” (Though, to be fair, hardly anyone was.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMpZya"&gt;This week marks her third anniversary on Twitch, and it’s clear she’s come a long way from those early days when she was streaming without a camera; today, for example, she’s being featured in &lt;em&gt;InStyle&lt;/em&gt; magazine on a list of badass women. Which she says is exciting, but it’s not exactly her goal. “My goal with streaming, if nothing else — I really want to inspire,” she says.  “I want to inspire people that look like me, specifically women that, you know, they can do this too. And there’s room for them as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U9d2r"&gt;It’s a noble mission. “As we know, the gaming industry is a very white male-dominated and, as we saw with everything going on with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;PogChamp emotes&lt;/a&gt;, people will make it clear that they don’t want people of color, specifically Black people in this industry,” she says. “I definitely want to kick down doors and open doors not even just for myself, but for others that look like me as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ757n"&gt;And she has. Briana’s been more successful in three years that most people ever become on Twitch; she’s hosting shows for thousands, that sometimes land on the site’s front page. Even so, despite all the success the last year has brought, Briana says that 2020 was tough. Which makes sense, considering the global pandemic and the continuing rise of the authoritarian right. “Personally, I feel like it was the hardest year I’ve ever experienced,” she says. “I went through depression, second-guessing myself, and impostor syndrome. And, you know, dealing with everything going on in the news and with COVID. And the government.” But in terms of business, and in terms of streaming specifically, she says it was the most successful year she’s ever had. (This year, Briana tells me, she plans to be kinder to herself, and mostly just to keep her sanity intact.  “You can’t be in front of the computer all the time,” she says.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmj3m0"&gt;2020 was also Twitch’s best year ever. The number of hours people spent watching Twitch have nearly doubled since last year, and the pandemic meant that the gaming influencer landscape had begun to shift and become much more mainstream. While Briana jokes that she wishes she’d found streaming earlier — “so I wouldn’t have all this student debt” — she does feel like she came into the space at an interesting time. Numbers matter less when working with brands, and, she says, brands are starting to realize the content and viewer engagement is more important when choosing who to partner with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eQkW8H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AliveAdventurousEggnogSaltBae&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7rtNy"&gt;Even so, Briana says she wants to diversify her output. “What happened with Mixer really solidified something in my head, like, ‘OK, all of this could be gone tomorrow. What’s going to happen after that? What are you going to do?’” she says. “If all of my content is in one place, what am I gonna do if it’s gone tomorrow?” It’s led her back to YouTube, where she got her start, and also to TikTok. “While Twitch is starting to become a household name, a lot of people still don’t get it,” she says. Even her own family, it’s a strange conversation to have — she was in school to become a teacher, and now she plays games online for her community, the Bae Brigade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGlGpm"&gt;By now it’s the end of our interview, and I ask my favorite interview question — is there anything that I should have asked you that I didn’t? “OK, so I was starting to think maybe we should use my full name,” she says. “It’s Briana Williams. I feel like you know, 2021 is the year that I maybe start using my government name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iPuAk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUJHNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to delete your Facebook account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sYy8rKh0cwIfLUFjJKm-l3oZWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672679/acastro_180319_1777_facebook_data_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amc9vX"&gt;\\If you’ve finally given up on the world’s most popular social media network, it’s not too complicated to remove yourself from the service. But before you delete all of those pictures, posts, and likes, you should download your personal information from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv7htI"&gt;Your Facebook archives contain just about &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254?helpref=faq_content"&gt;all of the pertinent information related to your account&lt;/a&gt;, including your photos, active sessions, chat history, IP addresses, facial recognition data, and which ads you clicked, just to name a few. That’s a ton of personal information that you should probably maintain access to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAnPVG"&gt;To download your archive using the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tB7vax"&gt;Click on the “down” arrow in the upper right corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Kt1gj6"&gt;Go to “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lgR1ve"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Your Facebook Information.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cDMGa3"&gt;In the center, find and click on “Download Your Information.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HTwPMi"&gt;You can select which info you want to download (or you can just download all of it). At the top of the page, there are drop-down lists that let you create a date range (if you want to), download your data in either HTML or JSON, and choose between high, medium, or low media quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mvP37T"&gt;When you’re ready, click on “Create File.” You’ll get notified via email when your file is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can choose which Facebook data you want to download." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUZk4Q6xFgcb5peanneSZXgHkOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236250/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_3.55.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose which Facebook data you want to download.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SMQa5r"&gt;After you’ve finished downloading your archive, you can now delete your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtRjWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beware: once you delete your account, it cannot be recovered. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpYFGE"&gt;When you are ready to delete your account, go back to the page headed “Your Facebook Information” and click on “Deactivation and Deletion.” Here, you can choose between temporarily deactivating your account or permanently deleting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOhLic"&gt;If you want to delete it, either click on “Delete Account” on that page, or click &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which will take you to the same account deletion page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96KTd8"&gt;You’ll get another chance here to download your archive or choose deactivation rather than deletion. Once you click “Delete My Account,” your account will be marked for termination and inaccessible to others using Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Before you delete your account, you get another chance to deactivate or download your info." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbEa6byRI3aXdADpgdcF41SDzLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236285/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_4.06.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before you delete your account, you get another chance to deactivate or download your info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4kAsuU"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/125338004213029?helpref=uf_permalink"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that it delays termination for a few days after it’s requested. If you log back in during that period, your deletion request will be canceled. So don’t sign on, or you’ll be forced to start the process over again. Certain things, like comments you’ve made on a friend’s post, may still appear even after you delete your account. Facebook also says that copies of certain items like log records will remain in its database, but it notes that those are disassociated with personal identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tXW7T"&gt;If you’re really serious about quitting Facebook, remember that the company owns several other popular services as well, like Instagram and WhatsApp, so you should delete your accounts there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbiWVi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 9:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 28th, 2018 and has been updated to allow for changes in the Facebook interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to fix Windows 10 bug that can corrupt a hard drive just by looking at an icon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWqTcuDpF2oIp3kUrvkvUYwvOG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672420/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUYri7"&gt;Microsoft says it’s planning to fix a bizarre Windows 10 bug that could corrupt a hard drive just by looking at an icon. Security researcher Jonas L &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonasLyk/status/1347900440000811010"&gt;first warned&lt;/a&gt; about the bug earlier  this week, describing it as a “nasty vulnerability.” Attackers can hide a specially crafted line inside a ZIP file, folder, or even a simple Windows shortcut. All a Windows 10 user needs to do is extract the ZIP file or simply look at a folder that contains a malicious shortcut and it will automatically trigger hard drive corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR3OJs"&gt;Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst at the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1347958161609809921"&gt;confirmed the findings&lt;/a&gt;, and notes that there could be more ways to trigger the NTFS corruption.  Dormann also revealed the vulnerability has existed in Windows 10 for nearly three years, and that he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1347995994508693504"&gt;reported another NTFS issue&lt;/a&gt; two years ago that still hasn’t been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQpHsN"&gt;“We are aware of this issue and will provide an update in a future release,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The use of this technique relies on social engineering and as always we encourage our customers to practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nNH7iJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seems like it can also be triggered when you paste the command in the URL of a browser except ie so far &lt;a href="https://t.co/7XsGhrowps"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7XsGhrowps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Siam Alam (@Slmi0xC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slmi0xC/status/1349983599865466881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xzw3dM"&gt;Others have found that the vulnerability also occurs if you simply paste the offending string into the address bar in a browser. &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-bug-corrupts-your-hard-drive-on-seeing-this-files-icon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;has also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; the bug in a variety of different ways, and notes that it will prompt Windows 10 users to reboot a PC to repair the corrupted disk records. The reboot will trigger the Windows chkdsk process, which should successfully repair the corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mKNnG"&gt;The repair process isn’t always automatic, though. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1349905649703022594"&gt;Dormann says&lt;/a&gt; it may require manual intervention to successfully repair the corrupted disk records. The bug also doesn’t require admin rights to trigger or special write permissions. That could make it more problematic for IT admins if chkdsk fails to automatically repair affected drives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zocdoc offers COVID-19 vaccine scheduler to health care organizations  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Opens Javits Convention Center As Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCi2hS76Gjsr1-APGrL-OSuGHkE=/0x2:6644x4431/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672340/1296201464.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zmwf36"&gt;Medical appointment company Zocdoc is offering to handle COVID-19 vaccine scheduling logistics for hospitals and health systems, many of which have spent the early days of the vaccine rollout struggling to handle the crush of demand for doses. Mount Sinai Health System in New York has been using the company’s tool to handle vaccine appointments since mid-December, and has scheduled over 100,000 appointments since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDxmxH"&gt;“It’s for anyone who’s in the front lines of administering COVID-19 vaccinations, to streamline their work. That’s our contribution to the public health effort,” Oliver Kharraz, CEO and founder of Zocdoc, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The scheduler is free for any group offering vaccines, even if they aren’t Zocdoc clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBq3Tj"&gt;Without federal coordination, state and local public health departments have been left to coordinate vaccine appointments on their own, often with limited resources. Many makeshift digital platforms across the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/vaccine-registration-sites-are-opening-across-the-country-and-filling-up-in-minutes.html"&gt;crashed&lt;/a&gt; or locked people out after thousands scrambled to sign up at once. “It’s one of these things that looks deceptively simple, but it’s deceptively hard to do,” Kharraz says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APS9wy"&gt;The Zocdoc Vaccine Scheduler can slot into an organization’s website to screen patients and book appointments, while shouldering high traffic demands. At its peak, the Zocdoc-run Mount Sinai scheduler was booking 100 appointments per minute, a traffic volume that could overwhelm a system that wasn’t accustomed to that load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OygjPN"&gt;Online tools some health departments and hospitals use to schedule vaccine appointments are also complex, requiring users to navigate multiple input fields or upload attachments. They’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;difficult for older adults&lt;/a&gt; who are eligible for vaccinations to navigate. Zocdoc is used by millions of seniors on Medicare, Kharraz says, so he’s confident the user interface would be accessible to that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Li0xk"&gt;Zocdoc says it is in discussions with multiple health care organizations and health departments about the scheduler. The team is also working with cities to set up centralized clearinghouses for all their local vaccination sites. In New York City, one challenge has been that there isn’t a single appointment scheduler that integrates every site. People looking for slots have to jump from website to website, and from interface to interface. Kharraz says that Zocdoc could integrate them all together. “It’s just pointless to be going from A to B checking what’s currently available,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbPVDu"&gt;Organizations other than Mount Sinai will start to go live with the tool next week, Kharraz says. “Our goal is to have really national coverage for this,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2hVGb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaNk0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to cancel your account at Netflix, Amazon Prime, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple TV Hulu Plus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LAoTontXny1CbzxU3RJXUwAY0Y=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672182/IMG_9379.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jcHElm"&gt;Let’s face it: some of us are so busy these days — what with pandemics and presidential elections and attempted overthrows of the government — that we don’t pay enough attention to what we are subscribed to (and paying for). Especially now, when there are more and more streaming services vying for our attention, it’s easy to go for a trial subscription, or to decide that you’re going to subscribe “just for a couple of months,” and then completely forget about it. Meanwhile, your charge card is being pinged every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsPHRR"&gt;For example, Matthew Inman, the artist who creates the comics site &lt;a href="https://theoatmeal.com/"&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, recently reported (to his apparent chagrin), that he had been paying for Netflix’s DVD subscription for the last 13 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="luVyPd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today Netflix was kind enough to let me know that  I've accidentally been paying for a DVD subscription for THIRTEEN FUCKING YEARS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been renting imaginary DVDs since &lt;br&gt;George Bush was president.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lesson here: keep an eye on your subscriptions. And vote Obama 2008. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iNtpuKzkdD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iNtpuKzkdD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Oatmeal (@Oatmeal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1349076285880819714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rmTfhs"&gt;(For our younger readers: yes, Netflix started out as a DVD rental service and then segued to the streaming service it is today.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T255hD"&gt;So it may be a good idea, especially if your income is a little tight, to check your current streaming subscriptions and drop the ones that you haven’t used for several months. (After all, unless you’re grandfathered into an especially good deal — and that’s happening less and less these days — you can always re-up again if there’s something on the service you want to watch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCmqvI"&gt;One thing to be aware of: during the process of canceling a streaming service, you may need to go through several pages or pop-ups urging you to not cancel or to at least settle for a less expensive (and usually less feature-filled) version of the service. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55637140"&gt;according to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, several lawsuits by such organizations as The Norwegian Consumer Council and Public Citizen in the US are claiming that Amazon Prime’s canceling process &lt;a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf"&gt;manipulates consumers into keeping their subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. So be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoLr9T"&gt;Here’s where you can go to cancel some of the more popular streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lwjUqE"&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netflix logo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hbwCRavkGxvN1FD3H8EZ1AvimA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/755523/netflix-logo-705px.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sx7uOC"&gt;You can find your current subscription status at Netflix by clicking on your personal icon on the top-right corner and &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount"&gt;choosing “Account.”&lt;/a&gt; The second section down should be “Plan Details,” and you’ll not only be able to change your plan, but you’ll immediately see if you have a live DVD plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53wLvq"&gt;If you want to leave the service completely, there is a “Cancel Membership” button to the left in the “Membership &amp;amp; Billing” section.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9dZwQI"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oUIfS7zhlNKY0wsyu1-yML49P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233388/Prime_0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XuoS2n"&gt;If you’re a month-to-month member of Amazon Prime and decide you want to cancel, you can go to this page and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=201910380&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;click on the “End Membership” button&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohwkqg"&gt;If, on the other hand, you’ve paid for an annual membership, you can only cancel within three days of signing up. You can also cancel that paid annual membership if you’ve just converted from a free trial or “if you and your account did not make any eligible purchases or take advantage of Prime benefits since your latest Prime membership charge” (in other words, if you’ve never used any of your Prime benefits since you paid for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAg6OG"&gt;If you want to completely close your Amazon account &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; delete all of your data, you can go &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy/data-deletion?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GBa63i"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmuPy5Z2FZqt75qJPQ422GM_OPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233417/HBO_Max_Press_On_White_Horiz_300dpi_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W1o4c8"&gt;HBO Max can be subscribed to either by itself, or through a number of different providers, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Roku, and a bunch of others. The best way to find out how to drop the service is to go to HBO’s &lt;a href="https://help.hbomax.com/Answer/Detail/2334"&gt;help page on canceling your subscription or trial&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the appropriate link for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twhHFa"&gt;According to HBO, you should try to cancel one or two days before your billing cycle renews, and if you cancel mid-month, you will still have access to HBO Max until the month is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5GdnwM"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsdiTYeTe2jHpMVh0DlhWOaRtDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15985971/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mufJxC"&gt;As with HBO Max, your Apple TV Plus subscription will be useable until the end of the billing cycle, even after you cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3o7IZ"&gt;Instructions for canceling your Apple subscriptions &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="95HoHH"&gt;To cancel on your Mac, go to the App Store, click your name (at the bottom of the page) and then “View Information” (at the top). Go to “Subscriptions” &amp;gt; “Manage.” Click on “Edit” next to the subscription you want to cancel and select “Cancel Subscription.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWkYfG"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings,” select your name, then “Subscriptions.” Select the subscription you want to leave, and Tap on Cancel Subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfdY9N"&gt;Hulu&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQaMvXMCCjH7-ridKyC3od2ac2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233427/Screen_Shot_2021_01_13_at_2.52.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hulu&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ypKXj"&gt;Like Apple TV Plus and HBO Max, your canceled subscription will last until the end of your billing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2cKxA"&gt;Hulu offers &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/cancel-hulu-subscription?language=en_US"&gt;instructions on how to cancel here&lt;/a&gt;. Since, like HBO Max, there’s a good chance you’ve signed up through a third party such as Amazon, Verizon, or Sprint, there are several links on the page where you can get specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OqzcDf"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COfUCxET7zyumttSE81Rhqm55h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233437/yt_tv_full_rgb_black_copy.max_2800x2800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zpNbg7"&gt;Interestingly, you can either cancel or pause your YouTube TV subscription (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129668"&gt;links for either process are on the same page&lt;/a&gt;). Pausing is a good option if for some reason (a vacation, a work project, temporary financial difficulties) you don’t want to use the subscription for anywhere from four weeks to six months. You won’t be able to use the service during that time to watch or record, but your already-recorded content will be saved. Once the pause is over (either via a pre-selected date or if you manually end the pause period), your billing will recommence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtTO6J"&gt;If you want to leave YouTube TV entirely, select “Cancel Now” on that same page. You will still have service until the end of your payment period; after that, you’ll have another 21 days to view the recorded programs in your library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CmT6VJ"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="disney+" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mXvQjzF9LVi8uyKQpglhwA7KFZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13412121/disneyplus.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2tFAqP"&gt;To cancel your Disney Plus subscription on the website, go to your profile icon in the upper-right corner, and then click on “Account.” Find your subscription level under the subhead “Subscription,” click on that, and then scroll down to where it says “Cancel Subscription.” As with most other services, you will still have access to Disney Plus until the end of your billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVf6oh"&gt;Note that canceling Disney Plus TV does not cancel your general Disney account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vrUI9Z"&gt;ESPN Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w1-ZlWtg6ANQSl4BI5OPkfCSS90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233680/ESPN_PLUS_FC_NEG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESPN Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KSWxJH"&gt;ESPN Plus is another one of those services that is available via a number of third-party sources, such as Roku, Amazon, Apple Pay, and iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9OSuP"&gt;If you subscribed directly via the web and want to cancel your subscription, log in, select “Manage” &amp;gt; “Cancel Subscription.” Otherwise, if you subscribed through one of the services mentioned above, your best bet is to &lt;a href="https://help.espnplus.com/espnplus_hc?id=espnplus_article_content&amp;amp;sys_kb_id=f6dcac54dbb79498534deadc139619c5"&gt;go to this page&lt;/a&gt;, which links to all of the ways it’s possible to cancel, depending on how you originally subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3KWm0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ze7SrE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon opens Alexa AI tech for the first time so car makers can build custom assistants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9bhu4POTPR335YGBr_f-c__BDY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672180/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbWfpd"&gt;Amazon will now allow third-party companies the unprecedented privilege of accessing the core artificial intelligence underpinning its Alexa digital assistant, a first for the company’s AI platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bALIFC"&gt;While Amazon has allowed companies to build skills for Alexa and allows pretty much any consumer electronic device maker to integrate Alexa into a compatible product, the e-commerce giant has not licensed the underlying AI tech for use in other assistant-like products. Amazon is calling the new offering Alexa Custom Assistant, and it’s starting out with a focus on the auto market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqENyo"&gt;Amazon is doing so to allow not just automobile manufacturers, but any company with a need for a digital voice assistant more control over the software experience. This will allow companies to create their own wake words and custom voices and capabilities Amazon says will “co-exist” with Alexa as it’s designed to work today. For the auto market, this provides Amazon the added benefit of having its software built directly into cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifMQO5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Car makers can design custom wake words and record unique voices for their assistants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JAJZAn"&gt;“Building an intelligent assistant is complex, time-consuming, and costly. Further, the rate of innovation and change is accelerating and assistants are always improving and getting smarter, requiring substantial ongoing investments,” the company explains in a blog post. “The Alexa Custom Assistant addresses this challenge by allowing companies to leverage Alexa’s world-class technology stack to create their own intelligent assistant without the investment, long development cycles, and resources to build it from scratch and maintain over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLFH1G"&gt;Amazon says companies will get access to custom wake words that use “the same state-of-the-art process” used for developing new Alexa wake words. Companies can create  their own unique voices for the assistants with help from “voice science experts” from Amazon that will help manage the recording process and the machine learning-based algorithms to build out the voice library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWuXWN"&gt;The screens and software experiences inside car have proven to be a ripe market for companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. But only the latter two tech giants have their own mobile operating systems that allow for plug-in platforms like Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto. Amazon has struck some deals with car makers, most recently with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21048587/lamborghini-rivian-amazon-alexa-integration-cars-ces-2020"&gt;Lamborghini and electric vehicle startup Rivian at CES 2021 earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, for direct Alexa integrations, and Amazon’s Echo Auto platform can be accessed via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497169/amazon-alexa-app-ios-android-auto-mode-echo-in-car-voice-assistant"&gt;a mobile app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;through a dongle you plug into your car&lt;/a&gt;. But these aren’t quite as seamless as the competition offered by Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2aODS"&gt;So much like how Amazon has strategically worked around its disadvantage on mobile phones, where Siri and Google Assistant reign supreme, to carve out a dominant position in the smart home, it’s now trying to better position Alexa as a built-in solution in environments that may not require a phone at all, thereby bypassing the need to compete directly with Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KQ25v7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is using Alexa to compete with Apple and Google in the car software space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4RHsg"&gt;The first company that has agreed to build its own Alexa-based assistant is car maker Fiat Chrysler (FCA), which has had an ongoing relationship with Amazon to integrate some of its technology, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050529/amazon-fire-tv-bmw-fiat-chrysler-ces-2020"&gt;Amazon Fire TV-powered screens&lt;/a&gt;, into its cars. Financial terms of any arrangement between Amazon and FCA were not disclosed, and it’s not clear whether Amazon is charging car makers to license the AI tech rather than giving it out freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVMFVy"&gt;Regardless, Amazon also says its intentions are to give all companies, not just automakers, a faster, cheaper, and less complex route to building their own voice experiences that feel tailor-made, instead of simply bolting on an integration with a third-party service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYUczc"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant also lets the custom’s AI products stay in control of and dictate information about special features, while Alexa can handle more general app-related requests like music playback and directions. “For example, if a customer asks Alexa to roll down a car window, or how to troubleshoot a device, the request will be routed to the brand’s assistant. If a customer asks the brand’s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa,” the blog reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kWHQa"&gt;Amazon says Alexa Custom Assistant will be available starting today to companies in the US and Canada, as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6rg7m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 8:46AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about Alexa Custom Assistant and how it’s available for more than just car makers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel has to be better than ‘lifestyle company’ Apple at making CPUs, says new CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEgGbV08ddIMYpC4zYwvsn8dlPY=/57x0:1992x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672176/intellogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkclz"&gt;Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, doesn’t start his new role until February, but he’s already prepping the company to take on Apple’s M1 chips. &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;, a local newspaper in Oregon where Intel maintains a large presence, &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html"&gt;reports that the chip maker&lt;/a&gt; held an all-hands company meeting yesterday, and Gelsinger attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avnQA2"&gt;“We have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes, Gelsinger reportedly told Intel employees. “We have to be that good, in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XtsIn"&gt;Intel has been facing increased competition from both Apple and AMD recently. Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;transition to its own silicon&lt;/a&gt; back in June, calling it a “historic day for the Mac.” The transition has gone well, with M1-based Macs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;providing impressive performance and battery life&lt;/a&gt; compared to existing Intel-based Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vw39M"&gt;While Apple will still use Intel chips for some Macs in the future, the move away from reliance on Intel is significant. It comes just as AMD has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;taken the performance crown&lt;/a&gt; from Intel in gaming, and pressures its laptop dominance with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;new Ryzen 5000 mobile chips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkaWTr"&gt;Intel announced earlier this week that current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;CEO Bob Swan is stepping down&lt;/a&gt; from the position on February 15th, set to be replaced by VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger. This marks a return to Intel for Gelsinger, who previously worked at the chip maker for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8Pxaz-BEMp1KC5irsrV-gT0ABM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22237510/intel.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Intel manufacturing facility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I5psXn"&gt;Gelsinger now faces the reality of competing with Apple, AMD, and others after Intel has struggled to transition to a 10nm manufacturing process for years. Intel has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;delayed its 7nm chips&lt;/a&gt; until at least 2022, and the company now faces a tough decision whether to outsource chip fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCtzuO"&gt;That’s a decision that Intel had scheduled to make next week, but &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian &lt;/em&gt;reports it could be delayed to give Gelsinger time to weigh in on the choice. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that Intel has been in talks with both TSMC and Samsung to outsource some chip production. Market research firm &lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210113-10651.html"&gt;TrendForce claims&lt;/a&gt; around 20 percent of Intel’s non-CPU chips will now be outsourced to both TSMC and UMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKYbE0"&gt;Analysts argue that outsourcing its own CPU production would allow Intel to be more flexible and focus on its designs to recover from the 10nm issues it has experienced. Apple, AMD, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other Intel competitors are already using TSMC for chip production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bumble disables politics filter after Capitol rioters spotted in dating app</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkk_UtyJsZVSZE40kGOZzOt-laQ=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68671854/bumble_fb_share.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XLkPYf"&gt;Dating app Bumble has temporarily disabled a feature which allowed users to filter potential matches based on their political leanings, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bumble/status/1349739735950843907"&gt;service has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature allows users to identify and filter matches with options such as “Apolitical,” “Moderate,” “Liberal,” and “Conservative.” In a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-removes-political-filter-capitol-riot/?europe=true"&gt;statement given to &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bumble said it had temporarily removed the feature in the US to “prevent misuse and abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr7mLP"&gt;News of the change emerged after Bumble users reported seeing individuals on the app who appeared to have participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;riots at the Capitol building last week&lt;/a&gt;. On January 7th, Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347226225278935045"&gt;Alia Awadallah reported&lt;/a&gt; seeing “dozens” of men on dating apps that appeared to be in Washington, DC on the day of the riots. They suggested &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347231610165469185"&gt;taking screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of these profiles, and submitting this as evidence to the FBI following its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1347175086432907272"&gt;call for information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="REmxue"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm on hold with FBI and police. No idea if this will end up being useful but I feel like there's a good story there anyway, so everyone get on the apps and start screenshotting.&lt;/p&gt;— Alia Awadallah (@aawadall) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347231610165469185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbymup"&gt;One user reported getting more attention on Bumble after posting pictures of himself at the Capitol. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/-no-regrets-a-capitol-rioter-tells-his-story-from-inside"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fellows said he had entered the Capitol building with the mob, and even smoked a joint in the office of a US Senator. Fellows boasted that his profile on Bumble was “blowing up” after he posted pictures from the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAnzWW"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allisonnorris/status/1347416130500096000"&gt;widely shared tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Allison Norris reported that Bumble’s political feature filter had been used by “a friend of a friend” to increase her chances of matching with rioters who’d then send her pictures and videos of themselves in the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OAcGAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I know a friend of a friend who changed her preference on Bumble to Conservative. She’s matching with MAGA bros and they’re bragging and sending her pics and videos of them in the Capitol. She’s sending them to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;— Allison #FreeThemALL Norris (@allisonnorris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allisonnorris/status/1347416130500096000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HmxgLe"&gt;As of January 14th, users were reporting that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hilarialexander/status/1349707763686010891/photo/1"&gt;politics filter had disappeared&lt;/a&gt; as an option from the app. Bumble subsequently confirmed that it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BumbleSupport/status/1349740246909390849"&gt;temporarily disabled the feature&lt;/a&gt;, though it stopped short of saying it was disabled in direct relation to the Capitol riots. It added that it was removing the profiles of confirmed persons participating in the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s5TEcN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've temporarily removed our politics filter to prevent misuse. However, please rest assured that we prohibit any content that promotes terrorism or racial hatred, and we've already removed any users that have been confirmed as participants in the attack of the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;— bumble (@BumbleSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BumbleSupport/status/1349740246909390849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UozbMx"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; Bumble said its service prohibits content that “encourages any illegal activity” and that it would cooperate with law enforcement in relation to the profiles. “On January 6, we immediately ensured that our hate speech scanning and protocols addressed the attack on the U.S. Capitol and began removing any insurrection-related content from our platform,” a spokesperson said, “If we see anything that would suggest someone has or is in the process of committing a potentially criminal act we will take appropriate steps with law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boVtKZ"&gt;Following its call for evidence, the FBI reported earlier this week that it has received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227633/doj-fbi-evidence-capitol-trump-riot-attack"&gt;over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence&lt;/a&gt; after the attack on the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 MacBook Pro will ditch the Touch Bar and bring back MagSafe, say reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/578LDvIoamqsoVtOTsZuIoUSoFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68671647/akramer_201113_4290_0007.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43m1v7"&gt;Apple is planning a major MacBook Pro redesign for the third quarter of 2021, according to a research note written by TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo and reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/14/kuo-details-2021-macbook-pro-new-design-with-squared-off-sides-magsafe-connector-and-io-return-touch-bar-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/15/kuo-two-redesigned-macbook-pro-models-with-magsafe-no-touch-bar-coming-in-q3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo calls it the first major redesign of the MacBook Pro since the introduction of the current generation in 2016. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has followed up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; corroborating many of the same details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyoot7"&gt;The new MacBook Pro is said to have squared-off sides like the iPad Pro and the iPhone 12; the current laptop already has sharp edges, but it sounds like the top and bottom panels are going to be flatter than before as well. The new model will reportedly come in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes both featuring Apple-designed Arm processors, with no Intel options. Kuo says the laptops will use a similar heat pipe system to the current 16-inch MacBook Pro, giving more thermal headroom and enabling higher performance. Bloomberg reports that the new models will have “brighter, higher contrast” displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8rkiH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New story: For new high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, Apple indeed plans return of MagSafe, the end of the Touch Bar (finally), brighter screens, minor design changes, next-gen M-series chips and more. Launch around mid-2021. &lt;a href="https://t.co/eL3r06oexW"&gt;https://t.co/eL3r06oexW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1349973715623178241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi5ZQg"&gt;Perhaps most notably, Kuo believes the new Pro laptops will backtrack on some of the controversial changes Apple made with the current generation. The OLED Touch Bar, for example, is said to have been replaced altogether by physical function keys. Kuo also says that there’ll be a wider range of ports reducing the need for dongles, though he doesn’t get specific. And a MagSafe magnetic charging connector is also set to return. (It’s not clear whether it’ll have anything in common with the new MagSafe accessory system for the iPhone 12.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8jpjj"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; was just released in November, but that model otherwise had near-identical hardware to the existing Intel version. If Kuo is to be believed — and his track record suggests that he is — the next models could be a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbPjpx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Jan 15th, 2.45PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of Bloomberg’s subsequent report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Parler archive is being converted into an interactive map of the Capitol building attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_d3zYDe3sdttLN9gx1Rgma3_tE=/189x67:998x606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68670796/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_3.10.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Patr10tic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6BO1zF"&gt;A developer going by the name of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patr10tic"&gt;Patr10tic&lt;/a&gt; has created &lt;a href="https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/"&gt;an interactive map&lt;/a&gt; using GPS metadata and videos from the app Parler to offer a glimpse of what was happening inside and around the Capitol building during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;the violent protest&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdmm8/developer-makes-interactive-map-of-parler-videos-from-capitol-hill-riots"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtCGTk"&gt;The project is an expansion on similar maps &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;like the one &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate just how many Parler users were part of the mob that occupied the Capitol building, based off an archive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;created by a researcher known as @donk_enby&lt;/a&gt;. Patr10tic’s map (currently named “Y’all Qaeda”) uses the same archive and connects GPS coordinates with actual video, offering a map of red icons placed around the Capitol for each associated video post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1Aidl"&gt; Viewing the videos has an unsettling quality, not just because of the intersection of conspiracy theories and white supremacist ideology on display, but also the perspective they offer on the Capitol itself. Most people haven’t seen the chambers of Congress and the halls of the Capitol outside of press photos or &lt;em&gt;C-SPAN&lt;/em&gt; live feeds. Seeing protesters milling about in Congressional offices feels strange, but it’s even stranger seeing them wander through the Capitol building, unbothered, with police looking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHEkKr"&gt;Whatever feelings watching the videos provoke, the map and other projects like it could prove vital to investigating just how the events of January 6th took place. Parler’s already been identified &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/"&gt;as a site for planning last week’s protests&lt;/a&gt;, and this growing, mapped compilation of posts shows that it was one of the main ways it was documented as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fn7Q36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
