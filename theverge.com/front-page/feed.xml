  &lt;p id="G3pFw9"&gt;Sony is releasing a fresh batch of PlayStation 5 consoles today through its online storefront at 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT. Both the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;$499.99 version of the PS5&lt;/a&gt; that can accept discs and the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;discless version that costs $100 less&lt;/a&gt; will be available for order. Unlike other retailers who release PS5 consoles into the wild, Sony uses a slightly more orderly queuing system that automatically puts you in line if you’re on its site when the sale goes live. Consoles will likely sell out quickly, as they have done since the console launched late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vd7KH8"&gt;If you’re looking for tips on securing a PS5, be on time and attentive, and hope that luck is on your side for this one. Oh, and be sure to log into your PlayStation account and enter your shipping and payment information ahead of time. Sony says that it’ll ship the console for free if you purchase something alongside it in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XTs87f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="4NPUEh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yTzmyN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XG78YS"&gt;What good is a PS5 without extra games and accessories, though? As mentioned before, Sony will give you free shipping today if you check out with an extra item in your cart in addition to the console, so check out the games and accessories below to see if there’s something you might want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYRQ4W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>There’s still a place for the Note in Samsung’s Galaxy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung has filled out its S-Pen ecosystem of apps nicely." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avsTsud09fJpQdJ5U6vR6EzyvvU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738502/dbohn_201004_4226_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJ5Xmw"&gt;For the first time in many years, August will come and go without the introduction of a new Galaxy Note smartphone from Samsung. Instead, with their lower prices and improved durability, the company is giving its latest foldables — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; — a firm push into the mainstream phone market. With the Z Flip selling for a penny under $1,000, it’s certain to stand out from the iPhone and Samsung’s own Galaxy S21 devices that cost a similar amount (or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjvXvv"&gt;But for repeat buyers of Notes past and present, it does feel like there’s something missing. We’re talking about the brand that established Samsung as the leading manufacturer of huge phones. Yet the company has completely skipped producing a new Note this year and has tried to explain it away with a simple “not this time around.” For now, the lineup isn’t gone; last year’s Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will remain for sale in 2021. The latter remains a legitimately excellent phone today, so even with Samsung hitting pause for a year, at least there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeKddK"&gt;Samsung’s stance on the Note’s future is vague enough that it leaves room for an eventual return &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;if foldables don’t become the next big thing&lt;/a&gt;. But I’d argue that at least one traditional Galaxy phone with a stylus should remain in the company’s plans regardless. It’s too soon to move on from everything that Samsung was doing so right, and tacking S Pen support onto its other flagship phones doesn’t quite live up to the Note’s legacy. And there are several reasons for the company to give it another go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PmckpE"&gt;People seem to like stylus phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UJXu2I"&gt;The Note is no doubt the de facto stylus smartphone, but other companies have also found success. Motorola has said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; quickly became the most popular device in the G-series after its release, and that was enough for the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;produce a 5G-capable sequel&lt;/a&gt; this year. And before LG’s complete exit from the smartphone market, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;its Stylo phones&lt;/a&gt; were some of its more popular mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdzYW"&gt;You can’t overstate the importance of a built-in silo for storing the stylus away when it’s not being used. On the Note, the S Pen is there when you need it — for drawing, signing a PDF, or whatever else — and then it’s gone and completely unobtrusive when you don’t. No add-ons or special phone cases required. Those latter solutions only add friction that can take away from the whole appeal. Using a phone case is perfectly fine, and most people do, but trying to incorporate a stylus slot there is far from ideal if you’ve got normal-sized hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZAfKgY"&gt;The Note deserves a better swan song than the Note 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEFoBH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was true to the line’s usual recipe of stellar build quality, high-end specs, and a giant screen. But the regular Note 20 was a poorly executed misfire. Samsung’s strategy of pursuing a slightly lower price point made sense, but there were enough compromises with last year’s regular Note that it was difficult to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NitFnM"&gt;Most glaring of all was that it had a 60Hz display, when even cheaper Samsung phones like the Galaxy S20 FE had evolved to smoother refresh rates. The cameras were worse, it had a plastic back, and all of these tradeoffs were made to reach a still-expensive price of $999.99. In the eyes of many Note fans, it was a frustrating mismatch, and they rejected the Note 20 for it. Marques Brownlee went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exk34o-MMIE"&gt;call it the “Nope 20.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEbqoh"&gt;This was particularly disappointing after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20845028/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-s-pen-camera-specs-features-price"&gt;got it right the year prior with the Note 10&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t saddled with the same number of disappointing concessions. That device felt like it was meant to be a mini version of the larger, flagship Note 10 Plus. But the Note 20 came off more as an example of what happens when a company cuts too many corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Pgg2cE"&gt;A case is an imperfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="REO0KF"&gt;Samsung hyped the addition of S Pen support when it announced the Galaxy Ultra S21 earlier this year. And the experience of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the stylus seems to be on par with a Note. But then you’ve got to &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; it somewhere, and that’s where there’s no substitute for an actual Note. Without a designated slot on the phone itself, Samsung’s solution was to make a case that could keep the S21 Ultra and S Pen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryxSk"&gt;However, it came with a downside: worse ergonomics. As Dieter wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21 Ultra review&lt;/a&gt;, the phone can feel more manageable in your hands than an iPhone 12 Pro Max because it’s taller and narrower. That easier-to-hold advantage is diminished somewhat by Samsung’s silicone case for the S Pen. Since there’s a permanent holding spot for the stylus on the case’s left side, the device is noticeably larger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBtMX0cXBulzWbcDrZk12pk-S1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788254/2D9400D9_EDF5_4457_B7EF_1DAB684961DE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung bundled the S Pen with a case for the S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgCiau"&gt;For the Z Fold 3, Samsung came up with a case design that places a holster at the hinge. I think this will work out better, since the Fold is more narrow than most smartphones (including the S21 Ultra) when closed — so it won’t feel as unwieldy even with the added space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9L1q7"&gt;But unless third-party case makers come up with their own options, you’ll be limited to that one specific Samsung case if you want to carry the S Pen with minimal risk of it being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tNbHhi"&gt;Selling the S Pen separately makes it feel like an afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8x3gkZ"&gt;Even though it went to the trouble of creating a “Fold Edition” S Pen with a retracting spring tip, Samsung won’t be bundling that with its latest flagship foldable. Rather, you’ve got to buy it (or the pricier S Pen Pro) separately. The Fold Edition comes bundled with its specially designed case for $79, while the S Pen Pro is sold standalone for $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42tNGI"&gt;An S Pen still comes included with many of Samsung’s latest tablets and laptops. But making it an added purchase on top of the $1,800 Z Fold 3 will probably lead some people to pass on it entirely. If the Fold is meant to usher in a new era of smartphone productivity, why not toss the Fold Edition stylus and case in the box? Maybe that’d ease the sting of not getting a phone charger, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuuVsG"&gt;Another Samsung stylus phone could be great if done right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e68mX2"&gt;I hope that last year’s models won’t be the end of the line for the Galaxy Note. Samsung still hasn’t come up with an alternative that matches the coherence and convenience of a phone designed with the stylus in mind from the very beginning. But where should the company go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrc7lm"&gt;I could see Samsung choosing the “special edition” route (think Apple’s iPhone SE, but high end) and releasing a new, top-spec Note every few years for the diehard fans that will pay top dollar for their giant slab of glass and S Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aon35j"&gt;But an even better development would be if the stylus trickled down to at least one of Samsung’s popular A-series phones and brought more people into the experience — for much less money. That’d be a clear sign that Samsung is committed to the S Pen, even if the Galaxy Note itself remains on hiatus. The benefits of a stylus shouldn’t be reserved for the $1,000-and-up tier. You’d want a high refresh display since that does genuinely improve the responsiveness of drawing and note-taking. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Galaxy A52 already checks off that box&lt;/a&gt;, so we know it’s possible even if the company wants to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8BfJJ"&gt;Part of the problem with the Note 20 was Samsung’s messaging: it tried to pass off midrange hardware as something more premium. The pushback and so-so reviews shouldn’t have come as a surprise. But Samsung wouldn’t need to over-sell a Galaxy A-series phone with a stylus: it could be a hit all on its own merits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can get three months of Stadia Pro for free</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KViuqO"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Big-releases-Big-deals-Big-week/ba-p/66265"&gt;offering a new promotion to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt; — three free months to try the games included in Stadia Pro, as long as you’re a new subscriber (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/youtube-premium-stadia-pro-offer/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While there’s a chance someone willing to pay to remove ads from YouTube may have already messed around with Stadia, three months is a solid amount of time to see if cloud gaming makes sense for you, and it’s two months longer than Stadia’s usual free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pql7ut"&gt;The deal comes with a few caveats, naturally. Besides limiting the free months to new subscribers, Google is also only offering the promotion in the following countries: the US, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. You can claim the offer until January 31st, 2022, and you have until February 14th, 2022 at 9AM PT to redeem it, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/10693693"&gt;according to Google’s fine print&lt;/a&gt;. If you cancel, expect to be charged Pro’s $9.99 per month price once the three months ends and to lose access to any games you didn’t purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wThyw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stadio Pro’s library of games is eclectic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mIH1lL"&gt;Stadia Pro includes the benefits of a game library and higher resolution video quality for the games you stream, though it’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/games"&gt;the current selection of games&lt;/a&gt; you can claim for free is a bit... eclectic. There are beloved modern entries like &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, smaller indie titles like &lt;em&gt;Floor Kids&lt;/em&gt;, and classic options like &lt;em&gt;Killer Queen Black. &lt;/em&gt;For most newer releases, you’ll have to purchase them outright, and you can find quite a few things to play that way. Stadia Pro subscribers typically get a discount, too.  Even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google’s taken a step back from Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624023/stadia-direct-touch-control-scheme-humankind-stadia"&gt;continues receiving interesting new releases&lt;/a&gt; to purchase in its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUFUU5"&gt;You can redeem the free three months starting today. Stadia also offers games like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/every-game-you-can-play-free-stadia"&gt;to try for free with just a Google account&lt;/a&gt;: no need to provide a credit card just to find out if Stadia works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is struggling to moderate re-creations of mass shootings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzs4IVTRLtIE4tU6fX6X426A6Zk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738180/acastro_180109_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g4Y81u"&gt;For over a year, Anti-Defamation League researcher Daniel Kelley has been finding re-creations of a horrific mass shooting on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — and every time he looks, he says he finds more. Kelley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s happened three times: first in January 2020, then again in May 2021. The most recent incident came on August 13th, as he was preparing a presentation on how to report offending content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQY6tP"&gt;“I would like one time,” Kelley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljkelley/status/1426209012815704068"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; after the last incident, “to search for ‘Christchurch’ on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and not find a new recreation of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting on a game platform aimed at very young children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eT2lL"&gt;The mosque shooting, which killed more than 50 people, has been condemned as one of the most violent single acts of religious hatred undertaken in recent years. In the wake of the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern &lt;a href="https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/jacinda-ardern-on-mosque-shooting-one-of-new-zealands-darkest-days/"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEsgD2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Each game on ‘Roblox’ is a potentially a social platform in and of itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rebImC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed Kelley’s finding, locating two different &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experiences focused on the shooting through a simple text search for “Christchurch.” Both rooms had logged more than two hundred visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DffaqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; proactively monitors for terrorist content, but the scenarios flagged by Kelley seem to have slipped through. Reached for comment, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; insisted that the platform is aggressively moderating against re-creations of mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJFWpv"&gt;“We promptly removed this experience from &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; after it was brought to our attention and suspended the user responsible for violating our Community Rules,” a company representative said in a statement. “We do not tolerate racism, discriminatory speech, or content related to tragic events. We have a stringent safety and monitoring system that is continuously active and that we rigorously and proactively enforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezEion"&gt;References to the Christchurch shooting are particularly difficult to block through automatic text searches, the company said, since a catchall filter would also block references to the city. “In this case our proactive detection includes human review to balance allowing references to the geographic location (New Zealand’s largest city) but not uses that violate our policies,” the representative continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSo9pM"&gt;Part of the issue stems from &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s sheer size — the result of rapid and unprecedented growth. The game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"&gt;currently boasts over 40 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a flood of user-generated rooms too massive to manually scan. The distributed structure of the game, which relies on users generating their own scenarios and spaces, makes it particularly challenging to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Qhr9C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; filed to go public in November, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;claiming in a filing&lt;/a&gt; that the game had been played by more than half the children under 16 in the US. The company is currently valued at roughly $45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrqKM2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;The same IPO filing&lt;/a&gt; specifically names community moderation issues as a potential risk to the business. “The success of our business model is contingent upon our ability to provide a safe online environment for children to experience,” the filing reads. “If we are not able to continue to provide a safe environment, our business will suffer dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdtBdk"&gt;As an extremism researcher, Kelley is less worried about the health of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s business, and more worried that the platform could become a vector for radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqA4el"&gt;“Each game on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is a potentially a social platform in and of itself, and can potentially give refuge to players of all ages who are flirting with or fully engaged with hateful ideologies online,” Kelley says. “Every space that allows for the veneration of hateful ideologies ... contributes to the normalization of these ideologies and their spread.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS 15 beta fixes the Safari address bar and lets you move it back to the top</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQiZaXf28tT68EDKnF3rm01iCgY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738014/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tq7nN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes"&gt;Apple has updated Safari’s design&lt;/a&gt; in the latest iOS 15 beta (Developer Beta 6), making the address bar look and act more like what users are used to and giving you the option to put it at either the top or bottom of the screen. Safari’s redesign, especially on iPhones, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;been controversial&lt;/a&gt; since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Apple is starting to walk back the floating design that’s persisted throughout the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj0QLp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; founder and podcaster Federico Viticci has posted screenshots of the new design on Twitter, showing off the changes. If the user chooses to have the address bar on the bottom, it sits above a row of controls, including back and forward buttons, a share button, and the tab button. (In previous versions of the beta, these buttons were one with the address bar.) If the user chooses the option to have the address bar at the top, Safari will look similar to how it did in iOS 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wNWNe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We did it everyone:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safari in iOS 15 beta 6 features a new address bar at the bottom that sits below page content. A toolbar with buttons is back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we can put the address bar back at the top again   &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbCvauXoDy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dbCvauXoDy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427683610031702017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzlfWB214q6IXC-JQKxypW0vLhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788122/IMG_2284.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comparison, this is Safari’s UI in the previous beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjLV0"&gt;Apple has been tweaking and changing Safari’s new design since it made its debut in the first beta. The updates have been relatively small — buttons were added back into the address bar (making it a minefield of touch targets), and Apple &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qtUKzWab71Q?t=256"&gt;made the address bar easier to get to when you’re typing in a URL or search term&lt;/a&gt;. However, the incremental updates haven’t appeased those calling for a return to a more traditional design, one that doesn’t include a floating element that hovers above a webpage’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SaYo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Options should help please those who (kind of) liked the change, and those who didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRKvPp"&gt;The option to change where the address bar resides should please those who thought its new place at the bottom was a good one (regardless of how its actual design was executed), as well as those who prefer to have it at the top. It may make things tough for web designers, who will have to deal with the possibility of something butting up against either the top or bottom of their webpage, but it’s a nice option for users to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCHIpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427685686849769472?s=20"&gt;According to Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad version of Safari hasn’t changed with this update, though Apple introduced an option that more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;let you go back to a traditional design&lt;/a&gt; in Beta 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EVgo launches new pricing plans and a rewards program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOfGP7X6zVuRIgNjekL5Eebf6r8=/0x0:5231x3487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737960/B069C1F8_5E6C_495D_8097_017F02BD9DCF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9rSNR"&gt;EVgo is &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005630/en/EVgo-Announces-New-Nationwide-Plan-Options-New-Loyalty-Program-and-Innovative-Pricing-Pilot-in-California"&gt;changing how it prices the electricity&lt;/a&gt; that gets doled out on its electric vehicle charging networ, and is launching a nationwide rewards program for its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlgfKA"&gt;Starting in September, the company will start offering &lt;a href="https://www.evgo.com/newpricing/"&gt;three ways to pay&lt;/a&gt; for charging on its network across the country. There’s the typical pay-as-you go option, which has the highest price-per-minute of charging and requires a $1.99 fee for each charging session. There’s a basic membership program that requires $4.99 per month of pre-payments toward charging, but which waives the session and (in most locations) offers per-minute rates that cost a few cents less. And now there’s a higher-tier $6.99 per-month subscription plan called EVgo Plus that drops the session fees and offers even more affordable pricing, and waives the $3 fee for reserving a charging stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbn65Q"&gt;In California, however, EVgo will no longer charge per minute of charging in order to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/07/update-californias-ban-on-per-minute-billing-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;comply with new state regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will charge per kilowatt-hour (kWh). There will be three different pricing windows throughout the day: “early-bird” (12AM-8AM local time), “on-peak” (4PM-9PM), and “off-peak” (8AM-4PM and 9PM-12AM). The idea with these is to incentivize drivers to charge at hours when electricity is not only more affordable, but also when the grid is less stressed. EVgo says it may expand this windowed pricing structure to other states down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBPDfG"&gt;“We want to make sure that we’re maximizing the positive impact of the grid and give customers choice,” EVgo’s chief commercial officer Jonathan Levy tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you want to charge when it’s peak [hours] then that’s your choice, but there’s an economic reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hJ7tpM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Charging company EVgo is going public via SPAC merger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9cIi4T"&gt;EVgo is also trialing new location-based pricing adjustments in San Francisco and Los Angeles that will factor in “environmental and social justice considerations,” congestion, and “other market dynamics.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oX2v6R"&gt;Along with the new pricing structures, EVgo will give out five “points” for every dollar spent on charging, which the company says can be used toward free charging sessions. Users of any of the three pricing plans can earn these points, though EVgo didn’t say how many would be required to unlock a free charging session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leQpPJ"&gt;“Reliability has been such an important facet for electric vehicle drivers, so we want to make sure that they’re rewarded for continuing to be loyal to us and coming back to those EVgo chargers they know they can count on,” Levy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Dxh8"&gt;The changes come as EVgo recently became a publicly traded company, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;a merger with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. It’s not alone — ChargePoint went public earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210301005278/en/ChargePoint-Becomes-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Publicly-Traded-Global-EV-Charging-Network"&gt;merging with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, while others like EVBox and Wallbox have similar mergers in the works. These mergers are helping to bring a fresh round of investment to companies like EVgo, which could help make public EV chargers more ubiquitous. Expanding EV charging networks is a priority of the Biden administration and a focus of the infrastructure bill working its way through Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6fm5v"&gt;EVgo is also making these changes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;Tesla is getting ready to potentially open up&lt;/a&gt; its own Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs, something that would make the company eligible for government subsidies under the infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter launches new process for reporting COVID misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOR5shwF0-aU9ukrxB1rgkeFw-4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737830/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="euxgUJ"&gt;On Tuesday, Twitter announced that it will begin testing a new reporting feature for users to flag tweets containing possible misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYkvnT"&gt;Starting today, users will be able to report misinformation through the same process as harassment or other harmful content, through the dropdown menu at the top right of every tweet. Users will be prompted to select whether the misleading comment is political, health-related, or falls into another category. The politics category includes more specific forms of misinformation like content related to elections. The health category will also include an option for users to flag COVID-19-specific misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQcwqx"&gt;The new feature will be available on Tuesday for most users in the US, Australia, and South Korea. Twitter said it expects to run this experiment for a few months before deciding to roll it out to additional markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XGfbHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not every report will be reviewed &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hl0iZ"&gt;Twitter said that not every report will be reviewed as the platform continues to test the feature. But the data obtained through the test will help the company determine how it could expand on the feature over the next few weeks. The test could be used to identify tweets containing misinformation that have the potential to go viral as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxkvLZ"&gt;Last month, the Biden administration took a stronger stance against misinformation as new variants of COVID-19 have continued to spread. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; in July that social media platforms like Facebook were “killing people” with vaccine misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="916uUj"&gt;The statement followed a coordinated campaign from the White House pressuring platforms to more aggressively remove coronavirus misinformation. The US Surgeon General’s office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; outlining new ways platforms could counter health misinformation. The report called for “clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate” a platform’s rules and for companies like Facebook and Twitter to redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying” false information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHIY"&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588903/covid19-misinformation-section-230-facebook-joe-biden-white-house"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that would remove Facebook and other social media platforms’ Section 230 liability shield if they amplified harmful public health information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon removed Hub lockers from two Chicago parks after public outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_efPfqG5MR83nWxsJlKrAxhAVY=/0x131:2016x1475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737633/AmazonHubLockerChicaog.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqdLdl"&gt;Amazon has removed two of its Hub lockers from parks in Chicago after public outcry over blocked sidewalks, &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/14/amazon-removes-delivery-lockers-from-chicago-parks-after-furor-over-installing-them-on-sidewalks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. While they offer a convenient place to pick up packages and drop off returns, a locker making a public park less accessible might not be the kind of tradeoff even a devoted Amazon customer is comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvVEF"&gt;Photos shared by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?s=20"&gt;33rd Ward Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; make it pretty clear how egregious the placement was, at least in Brands Park. Technically, you could still roll by the locker and get to the rest of the park, but that possibility goes away as soon as someone stands in front to get something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="80TtXv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; I’ve spent a good part of my morning handling the placement of an Amazon box at a park in my ward. On this instance apparently it was installed in the wrong spot &amp;amp; will be moved. But the fact that Amazon gets to use our public parks for this because of austerity is enraging. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Rbabgcwt7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Rbabgcwt7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez    ✊    (@RossanaFor33) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6raE5"&gt;The natural response was outrage, including comments that the locker placement looked too absurd to be real. &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/chicago-park-district-remove-amazon-from-parks-keep-public-spaces-community-focused?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_30321202_en-US%3A4&amp;amp;recruiter=12705437&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition"&gt;An online petition followed&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426976743592710144"&gt;the Brands Park locker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nadignewspapers.com/2021/08/13/amazon-hub-locker-to-be-removed-from-forest-glen-park-at-alderman-nugents-request-lockers-also-installed-at-rosedale-wilson-other-area-parks/?fbclid=IwAR223XuvVcGUOAV28bqlbtv1uiEH86AZ7v7Q9jHia4e3G8c9GW5mMj-5Yzo"&gt;another locker at the Forest Glen Playlot&lt;/a&gt; were removed. Amazon also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to review future locations to prevent other problems. According to Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yF3h0Q"&gt;We value the community’s feedback and took immediate action to respond to these concerns, working with the Chicago Park District to remove the Amazon Locker. We are also reviewing our other Locker installations in partnership with Chicago Park District to ensure they are all located in appropriate areas that serve both customers and the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o8sNZa"&gt;What’s not entirely clear is how something like this happened. The Chicago Parks District tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it reviewed all of Amazon’s location choices beforehand “to ensure they met park needs,” but maybe sidewalk accessibility wasn’t a top priority? There’s also the larger question of why the city is cutting deals to put the private property of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;trillion-dollar companies&lt;/a&gt; in public parks in the first place. Rodriguez suggested to &lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; that lockers popping up in parks is a result of underfunding: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5XsF5t"&gt;When you have public institutions that are not well-funded, and can’t function with the budget they’re provided by the government, they need to look for other sources of revenue. This is how we get a company like Amazon to have a presence in our public parks. It’s disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pECZU3"&gt;Whatever the reason, the slow creep of the private and paid into public goods like parks always feels icky. It seems like the Chicago Parks District still plans to move forward with its Amazon deal, but hopefully, future placements are more thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGmjIC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBawjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9nRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1JeqBn"&gt;That huge carry handle, pump-action underbarrel grenade launcher, and digital ammo counter on the side: is there a more iconic sci-fi weapon than the &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; M41A Pulse Rifle? Now, it’s about to become an iconic Nerf blaster as well, because Hasbro has just announced a $95 version that flings&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;foam darts — enough of them that it might actually be viable in a stock Nerf war! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uli7jYcmdqpnpsPpR_wOimuGN48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787876/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_spin_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f8dSCU"&gt;You see, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;Nerf’s $130 blaster rifle from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or most of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17657140/nerf-overwatch-guns-foam-shooting-blasters-blizzard"&gt;its &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; toys&lt;/a&gt;, this 28-inch long blaster isn’t just a prop with a few token foam projectiles inside: it’s a fully-automatic blaster that takes Nerf Elite-sized dart magazines a la &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/RapidStrike_CS-18"&gt;the fan-favorite RapidStrike&lt;/a&gt;, powered by four C batteries, plus “movie-inspired blast sounds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV2waa"&gt;Oh, and Hasbro tells me that’s a genuine digital ammo counter on the side: it actually counts darts even if you hold the trigger down! The standard mag contains 10 darts, but it should fit less screen-accurate aftermarket ones to increase your capacity, and you can set the ammo counter as high as 99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7OGTna9zErJffeJvv-EgCo6Qs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787903/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gL8jbo"&gt;That underbarrel grenade launcher actually fires Nerf Mega darts (one at a time) and has a genuine spring-loaded plunger tube inside connected to a secondary trigger you can actually pull — unlike, say, the pitiful underbarrel rocket launcher on &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Demolisher_2-In-1"&gt;Nerf’s old Demolisher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/HAMP"&gt;similar blasters&lt;/a&gt; where you had to pull hard on a manual plunger to pop a rocket out. There doesn’t seem to be an internal magazine for additional Mega darts, though, so you might have to keep those in a pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NXY6VqAn5jRFCNnNk2tl49FhXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788025/Hasbro_Nerf_Aliens_Open2_FINAL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uaEXJ7"&gt;For years, toy blaster fans have been trying to replicate the features and functionality of the iconic &lt;em&gt;Aliens &lt;/em&gt;Pulse Rifle, converting their Thompson airsoft replicas and Nerf blasters into full-scale props. They’d often zip-tie or meld Nerf’s own blasters beneath their RapidStrikes or Stryfes to get an underbarrel blaster like this. My favorite so far is Campbell Nerf Works’ &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4569308"&gt;Stryfle, a 3D-printed set of parts&lt;/a&gt; you can use to combine a Stryfe and a handleless &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Magnus"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; to great effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czKkO0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DreGO7bXpRQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaHtIA"&gt;I’m actually working on a “Vitamin C Edition” of the Stryfle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424"&gt;myself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hh7SZL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My in-progress Stryfle &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZFLKeUHGTZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZFLKeUHGTZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3kmW8"&gt;But now, you don’t need to be a modder to have a fully functioning &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; Pulse Rifle that fires Nerf darts and looks far more the part. Well, at least you don’t once &lt;em&gt;October 2022&lt;/em&gt; rolls around, because today’s preorders aren’t expected to ship for a very long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpGKyK"&gt;And while $95 is a lot, it’s a good bit less than many of Hasbro’s other licensed collectibles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18760160/nerf-overwatch-soldier-76-blaster-hasbro"&gt;like the $130 Soldier 76 pulse rifle from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day Hasbro gets a licensed blaster right (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;I lay out some examples here&lt;/a&gt;), but this feels like it might be one of them. You can find preorders &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/nerf-lmtd-aliens-m41-a-blaster"&gt;at Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=Verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-games%2Fnerf%2Fproducts%2Fnerf-aliens-lmtd-aliens-m41a-pulse-blaster%2F11155847.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, with EB Games Canada to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
