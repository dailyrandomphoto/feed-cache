    <title>Supercell’s next game is all about co-operation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jayQus0oXQiV968FSc9Tqlli_LA=/71x0:830x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762844/Everdale_Splash_Alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fBxKul"&gt;Supercell, the Finnish developer best-known for mobile hits like &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;, announced its next game today — and it looks to be a big departure. Called Everdale, it’s described as “a peaceful building game based on cooperation and friendship.” There are plenty of mobile games about building towns or villages, but &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt;’s hook is that you’ll do that alongside other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEhsiD"&gt;Here’s the basic set-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kegaKr"&gt;Your village is actually part of a larger valley, where you and nine other players work together to build a big, wondrous utopia. In the valley, you’ll meet an eclectic cast of characters, make handcrafted goods, and trade with merchants from far off lands. More still, you can jump into local adventures, and level up your villagers at the esteemed valley guilds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="l1x6bq"&gt;For the most part, Supercell’s previous games have been centered on conflict, where that’s the fantasy card battles of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093052/supercell-brawl-stars-global-launch-iphone-android"&gt;the squad-based shooting in &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The peaceful tone of Everdale feels like a notable departure, and it’s also set in a brand-new universe. (Supercell has steadily been expanding the &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; franchise with new games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362092/supercell-clash-of-clans-clash-royale-new-games"&gt;including three new titles currently in development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21430993/clash-of-clans-royale-animated-short-youtube-supercell"&gt;an animated short&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBgBNF"&gt;You can check out &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt; for yourself today depending on where you’re based — the game is going into soft launch in a handful of countries, including Canada, the UK, Nordics, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The farmers market is moving online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7S9mpu_gL5egKp7N7jZs6FugaE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762774/VRG_ILLO_4687_Farmers_Markets.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought rampant growth for local food distribution platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zQpINo"&gt;For the past two decades at Crystal Organic Farm in Newborn, Georgia, a typical Saturday morning involved Nicolas Donck and, later, his partner in farming and in life, Jeni Jarrard, getting up at 4AM, loading up the truck with tables and tent and coolers and bins of eggs, peppers, okra, melons, herbs, flowers, or whatever was good that week, driving the hour to Atlanta, and spending a day in whatever weather — including sweltering heat, pouring rain, or bitter cold — before hauling the hour back, happy from feeding their community the food they spent all week growing, but also exhausted, and just a few hundred bucks richer for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUpX47"&gt;Then the pandemic came, and it hit farms hard. Supply chains, customer bases, and in some cases labor were upended. Small and medium-sized independent farms that relied on restaurant wholesale lost &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Biiu9JmAZY"&gt;huge percentages of their business&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Some local CSAs folded. Some farming operations &lt;a href="https://www.harvie.farm/blog/changes-in-the-local-food-market-2020-edition/"&gt;went belly up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRi5ME"&gt;Others, however, found a new path online. Farmer-specific e-commerce apps and services — among them, GrazeCart, Farmdrop, Farmigo, and GrownBy — have cropped up in recent years, offering the direct-to-consumer sales, customizable CSAs, preorders and delivery that farmers markets haven’t. When the pandemic began, this tech offered a new world of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HonAb7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Business is booming for food distribution platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCdhem"&gt;Donck and Jarrard were among the farmers who took the leap. When food distribution chains collapsed and people turned to local food, the pair made the snap decision to eliminate their old-school CSA program, lean into their relationships with two tech-based distribution platforms with which they’d already worked, and transition the rest of their business to sales and distribution platform Barn2Door. Now, late-pandemic farming looks like skipping the market, staying in bed for hours longer on Saturday, and enjoying a cup of coffee together — all while quadrupling business by selling online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agSsAQ"&gt;Does this ever-expanding landscape of food distribution tech make the job easy? Not in all ways, says Donck. “There’s always room for improvement. For example, everybody wants cucumbers, but we don’t have any right now,”  he says, lamenting the loss of a week’s crop to a swarm of squash bugs. “[Our customers] will have to go somewhere else for those.” But he and Jarrard agree, they don’t intend to go back to the way things were before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A web store showing pictures of different cuts of meat. A series of filters lets you view vegetables, eggs &amp;amp;amp; dairy, meat, mushrooms, and more." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-GbDgSt877eV2NyTSd5uASNPwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773614/crystalorganicstore.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crystal Organic Farm’s online store, powered by Barn2Door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4Ibto"&gt;They’re not alone. One of three digital platforms they now work with, Barn2Door, &lt;a href="https://www.barn2door.com/blog/2020/4/11/the-data-proves-it-local-farms-are-surging-online"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a 457 percent increase in revenue from orders and an 807 percent increase in the number of orders among their sellers in March 2020 alone. (In August, they ran a $6 million funding round to try and keep up.) Another — an online shopping platform called Fresh Harvest, which processes orders and facilitates door-to-door delivery across Georgia, and which Donck estimates constitutes some three-quarters of Crystal Organic’s business — tripled its year-over-year revenue in 2020, bringing in &lt;a href="https://blog.freshharvestga.com/2020-year-in-review/"&gt;$4 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWlHm5"&gt;This massive growth spans the sector: Harvie, which facilitates the direct sale and delivery of customized farm shares, launched 13 years ago. This past year, the company saw a 500 percent year-over-year increase in its farmers’ sales and quintupled the size of its team. WhatsGood, an app that facilitates purchase and pick-up between consumers and local fishermen, farmers, and foragers, grew from some 30,000 buyers to around 200,000 between January 2020 and December, according to founder Matt Tortora. The founder of Food4All, a platform designed to help farmers integrate all these other platforms, estimates growth in the past year and a half by a factor of seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bBZq37"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Farmers markets were really a counterproductive business model for a lot of farmers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zU8ZvZ"&gt;As with so many other shifts the pandemic accelerated, this growth shines a light on trends that were already in play: the &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e70ea6d10d5dc73a27d1184/t/5ea8f98be8098b7653211a83/1588132249515/SARE+Farmers+Market+Toolkit+2020.pdf"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt; of farmers market attendance; the &lt;a href="https://www.harvie.farm/blog/home-delivery-is-the-future-of-local-food/"&gt;growing demand&lt;/a&gt; for home delivery. “Farmers markets were really a counterproductive business model for a lot of farmers,” says Tortora, a former chef who founded WhatsGood in 2014. In recent years, farmers markets across the US reported a  “downward trend,” with year-over-year attendance and sales down by between &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e70ea6d10d5dc73a27d1184/t/5ea8f98be8098b7653211a83/1588132249515/SARE+Farmers+Market+Toolkit+2020.pdf"&gt;20 and 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; as of 2018, even while interest in locally sourced food has ticked &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2019/11/19/exploring-a-decade-of-big-changes-in-local-food/"&gt;upward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9VLG7"&gt;As this trend progresses, a growing number of local chefs, and eventually consumers, have come to apps like WhatsGood to connect with independent producers online. On Tortora’s app, they can browse local goods on the web or in the mobile app, fill a digital cart, check out in a single transaction, and then pick up their goods at a local hub — which might be a brewery donating space in its off hours, a single farm, or farmer’s market. In 2018, the company piloted a delivery business model, which yielded “holy shit numbers,” Tortora says. “It was a real ‘ah ha’ moment. Meat producers that would bring in $1,000 a day at farmers markets made four to five times that on their first day offering delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTWgv"&gt;While acknowledging that the last year was all kinds of terrible, the couple behind third-generation family-owned Ever-Breeze Farm in Westerly, Rhode Island, have to agree: Local food thrived. John Panciera, who runs his family’s dairy and grass-fed beef farm with his partner Bianca Lee Paredes, says the pandemic changed their community’s attitude, boosting customer interest and appreciation for locally sourced goods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An online store with photos of meat and eggs. You can buy beef bones, chorizo sausage links, Italian sausage, T-bone steak, and different packages of eggs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5W55uahTeiGuOQzgc3K8B-p9r8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773653/everbreezestore.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever-Breeze Farm’s store on WhatsGood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G1Z1mI"&gt;“I’ve been hesitant to say this to certain people, but COVID was really good for business,” Panciera says. “We just happened to take a chance, doubling the size of our flock last spring, and thank goodness we did, because as many eggs as we sold, we could have sold more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNJCuF"&gt;While, thanks to Paredes’s thinking outside the box, Ever-Breeze had already started to use WhatsGood for a sliver of their business pre-pandemic, they still largely relied on walk-in sales, peddling goods out of an old milkhouse on an honor system, in which customers would scrawl their names and purchases in a spiral-bound notebook and shove cash into a slit-topped coffee can. This made for chaotic energy, the couple recalls, with a dozen or more cars coming in and out of the driveway at all hours. Plus, it was a system that proved hard to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bPVkxx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you get it exactly right, it’s great — but you have to get it exactly right.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KH86Kf"&gt;Come spring of 2020, Panciera and Paredes decided to ditch the chaotic driveway model altogether and pivot their focus to digital distribution, which, within months, led to growing their egg market, scaling up their beef business, and even hiring their first-ever employee. In the app, Ever-Breeze’s products can reach customers from Massachusetts to eastern Connecticut — and the supply chain still feels as local as can be. “We’re being afforded this direct-to-consumer relationship,” Paredes says. “I know the names of the people I’m feeding, and that’s a big deal to me. If I stocked a grocery store in town with our beef, would I sell it? Probably, but would it feel the same? I don’t think so.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbI2ZM"&gt;The transition hasn’t been completely breezy, riddled with learning curves from permitting and expiration dates to needing unprecedented levels of consistency in their operation. And for the farmers attempting to combine and balance multiple of these apps in order to walk the tightrope between maximizing sales and meeting demand, those learning curves are even steeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Hl3"&gt;The platforms are trying to ease the friction. “In a lot of ways, this is a horrible business,” Harvie founder Simon Huntley says. “You’ve got perishable products, you’ve got high cost of goods sold, high labor costs, high capital costs, high delivery costs, low profit margin... If you get it exactly right, it’s great — but you have to get it exactly right.” Tech that can meet those challenges goes far beyond your basic e-commerce, and this niche corner of the tech world, he noted, is “littered with the corpses” of many venture capital-backed projects that came before, spent millions on product, and have “nothing to show for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRtf1a"&gt;While they perfect their methods, farmers are along for the ride. Despite two decades of doing things a certain way in Newborn, Donck and Jarrard have zero plans to go back to the market if they can help it, focused instead on perfecting the balancing act between platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JztKTj"&gt;Likewise, Panciera and Paredes are committing to the new models they adopted last spring. But already, things are starting to feel different. To keep up with the new volume, and the flock and livestock they planned around it, there will be no resting on their laurels. “We’re not looking back,” Panciera says. “But this year has shown us that, all right, you got lucky last year. Some of this just fell into our lap. But this year, we’ve had to start marketing a little harder now than we were,” he says. “From here on out, it’s going to be a different story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl8zW1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="232WH3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro review: these earbuds get a lot of things right</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The company’s most refined earbuds yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="udIoHB"&gt;The new $150 OnePlus Buds Pro are the company’s most elegant, polished set of true wireless earbuds so far. And there’s a lot of value packaged together for that price: they include active noise cancellation, wireless charging, IP55 dust and water resistance, and solid battery life. OnePlus also tosses in extras like a low-latency mode for gaming and Zen Mode Air, which plays soothing relaxation audio. They go on sale September 1st in either matte black or glossy white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anEz6R"&gt;The OnePlus Buds look quite sleek and less blatantly AirPods-esque (particularly the black version) than the company’s prior earbuds. Hopefully that’ll be enough to avoid any snags at US customs. They’ve also proven dependable and consistent in my testing so far, which couldn’t be said of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;$99 Nothing earbuds&lt;/a&gt; when I looked at those a few weeks ago. I bring up the Nothing buds because they’re the first project of OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s new company and, at least on paper, have similar capabilities, so there will inevitably be comparisons between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JrOYQd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10714688"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kT1giN"&gt;The earbuds have a shortened-stem design with a metallic finish on the stem portion. That’s a nice touch of style, and it’s also a marker of where you’ll pinch for controls. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457468/airpods-pro-force-sensor-control-audio-button"&gt;AirPods Pro force sensor&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus Buds Pro have identical controls on either side: pinch quickly with two fingers to pause, twice to skip songs, three times to go back, or hold to switch between ANC and transparency modes. There’s even the same faint little audio click in your ears whenever a pinch is registered. &lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; the AirPods, there’s no indented area of the stem for the sensor, but I found OnePlus’ approach to work reliably without it. It’s very much a borrowed idea, but one that’s at least copied well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGJAWV"&gt;I found the OnePlus Buds Pro to be airy and comfortable in my ears; they weigh 4.35 grams per earbud, lighter than both the AirPods Pro and more recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. But I never found a perfect fit with the three sets of silicone tips in the box: the large size was best, but I could still remove either earbud with the slightest pull. Their lightweight design helped mitigate this issue somewhat and kept them in my ears — they didn’t come loose when I shook my head or ate with them in — but OnePlus really could’ve used a more accommodating selection of ear tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6h63DEaW6azn8uU-w15vHQCU8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800050/DSCF4677_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case supports wireless charging and is IPX4 water resistant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsGqmS"&gt;Thankfully the less-than-perfect seal didn’t take away from their audio quality. The OnePlus Buds have 11mm drivers that the company says were “tuned for bass reproduction,” and that bears out when you listen to them. There’s a powerful, smooth foundation to tracks like “Don’t Go Dark” by Bleachers, and the OnePlus Buds Pro avoid becoming a bloated jumble of bass thanks a pleasing, non-harsh high end with ample detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoFv5b"&gt;The mids are a bit recessed, which is fairly common for earbuds at this price, and unfortunately OnePlus’ HeyMelody app (available for both Android and iOS) doesn’t include EQ adjustments. But I’ve been largely happy with how these sound, and they hold their own against the Amazon Echo Buds 2, Galaxy Buds 2, Jabra earbuds, and others in their price range. And I think they outrank the Nothing earbuds, but perhaps that should be expected for the $50 price difference. OnePlus includes an audio test to personalize your audio profile based on your own hearing. Like most other attempts at this, I wasn’t blown away by the difference and left this off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHidoHojD-9BjdUHmo8HVarF1MM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800066/DSCF4679_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds are $50 more expensive than the Nothing Ear 1s (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6yGHgkdiREzSgnRhV_7BUtpZxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800072/DSCF4681_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both earbuds have a stemmed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="peEofp"&gt;ANC performance has also been satisfactory, though I think it’d be more impressive if the earbuds sealed in my ears better. As is, the OnePlus Buds Pro let you manually pick between “extreme” and “faint” modes for noise cancellation. OnePlus says these range between 40dB (extreme) and 15dB (faint) of noise cancellation. There’s also a “smart” mode that automatically adjusts the level of ANC based on the loudness of your environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MptVMX"&gt;That’s where I left it for portions of my review, and the earbuds did seem to dial back their noise-canceling powers when I was in my living room, where the only noise was the whirl of a nearby fan. On the street and at my local coffee shop, it seemed like the OnePlus Buds Pro defaulted to cranking the ANC, which is precisely what I wanted. The OnePlus Buds Pro are quite good at ridding your ears of low-frequency noises and distractions, and they did a respectable job on New York subways. I think Amazon slightly bests them, and pricier buds like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds definitely still win out on the whole, but for $150, there’s not much to take issue with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0t7vT"&gt;The same holds true of battery life. It’s rated at up to five hours of straight playback with ANC on, and that extends to 23 hours including the case’s extra juice. Leave noise cancellation off and those figures grow to seven hours and a claimed 31 hours, respectively. I wasn’t able to fully test out the last estimate there, but in general the OnePlus Buds seemed faithful to the others and I didn’t have any unexpected battery issues or uneven discharging. The case can be charged wirelessly, and it’s even rated IPX4 for water resistance, which is pretty rare to see. The earbuds have a more durable IP55 rating for dust and water resistance, so as long as your fit is right, they’re a fine pick for workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qxv35rBi5cVrMXsNPpuDQWzDjLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800068/DSCF4682_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case is easily pocketable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZh4ou"&gt;Microphone performance was sufficient for voice calls, and those I spoke with could make me out clearly. But despite three mics in each earbud and wind noise reduction algorithms, I think it’s just a reality that as the stems of these earbuds get cut down in length, we’ll need to settle for “good enough” when speaking to people through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JojRsr"&gt;Then come the miscellaneous features. The earbuds have a low-latency “Pro Gaming mode” where their response is 94 milliseconds, but only when paired with a OnePlus phone running OxygenOS 11 or above. (This is another example of the earbuds&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627099/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-apple-airpods-pro-ecosystem-lock-in-features-companion-app"&gt; lock-in that my colleague Jon Porter recently wrote about&lt;/a&gt;.) Even then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632338/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-review"&gt;competitors like Razer&lt;/a&gt; are capable of hitting lower latency numbers like 60ms. Another OnePlus-exclusive feature is Dolby Atmos audio, which the earbuds don’t support on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CowWoW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10714700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDL9HV"&gt;More useful to me personally was the Zen Mode Air feature, which aims to help you relax by playing soothing sounds through the earbuds. You can pick which audio track you like best in the HeyMelody app — with options like warm sunrise, meditation, summer seashore, nighttime camping, etc. — and then it’s downloaded directly to the earbuds’ memory. This has the benefit of keeping the relaxation sounds available when you’re switching between different paired devices. OnePlus isn’t alone in offering this type of functionality: Jabra includes something similar with its earbuds. It’s not the sort of thing I’ll use frequently, but I like knowing this little trick is there if I need a minute or two of calm during a hectic day. Unfortunately the OnePlus Buds take after many competitors in that they currently lack multipoint pairing, so they can only connect to one device at a time. However, OnePlus says it aims to add multipoint through a future firmware update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pKrwVB"&gt;Compared to its past wireless earbuds, the refinement and strong performance of the OnePlus Buds Pro demonstrate that OnePlus has grown confident and comfortable in this market. There’s no shortage of competition at this price, but OnePlus has brought together a compelling mix of features and an attractive design with relatively few weak spots. They’re another reminder of just how much you can get for $150.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This tiny Simpsons TV lets you watch tiny Simpsons TV</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAdznz"&gt;Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/p9lasb/i_designed_and_printed_a_working_simpsons_tv/"&gt;buba447 has created&lt;/a&gt; an iconic &lt;em&gt;Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;TV with working dials that plays episodes of the long-running animated sitcom whenever it’s turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayDaEG"&gt;The palm-sized TV was designed in Fusion 360 and printed using an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcreality3d.shop%2Fproducts%2Fcreality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637549%2Fdiy-simpsons-tv-raspberry-pi-3d-printing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ender-3 Pro from Creality&lt;/a&gt;, according to its creator. Inside you’ll find a tiny &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/"&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero&lt;/a&gt; running Jessie Lite connected to the 640x480 display. The top dial turns on the TV (actually, just the display and speaker) while the lower dial adjusts the volume. Its 32GB SD Card is loaded with 11 seasons of compressed episodes that play in random order. The whole thing is powered by a USB port with a cable running out the back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 model is lighter and doesn’t need a screwdriver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kfDKfvY87GPDgmdXGudJ3Em_HPM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762521/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="deUSc6"&gt;Sony has quietly launched a revised PS5 model in Australia. &lt;a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2021/08/21/new-ps5-model-cfi-1102a-australia/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press Start&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian-based gaming site, reports that the revised PS5 models include a new screw for the base stand that no longer requires a screwdriver. Sony reportedly swapped in a new screw with a grip around the top so it can be easily adjusted by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUOoSa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press Start&lt;/em&gt; also reports that these updated PS5 models are around 300 grams (0.6 pounds) lighter than the original, but it’s not clear what Sony has removed or changed to bring the weight down. The new PS5s ship with a CFI-1102A model number, instead of the CFI-1000 found on the original.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_9hUNKuksYTnkyQfWMIdLKAlJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800017/PS5_Screws.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated PS5 stand screw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XDsBE1"&gt;Australia appears to be the first country to take stock of these slightly revised PS5 models. While Sony has removed the need for a screwdriver for the recommended base stand, you will still need one to access the optional removable M.2 SSD storage on the console. You can find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;best PS5 SSD options right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EidCUx"&gt;Sony is planning to rollout removable SSD storage with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;upcoming software update&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which is currently available for beta testers, also includes improvements to the PS5 dashboard UI, 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers, and a better way to differentiate between PS4 and PS5 versions of games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Higher-end Mac Mini reportedly landing ‘in the next several months’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBFfHymdXYfeBiDV-vf6brqPHkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762377/cwelch_201114_4292_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The port configuration on the current M1 Mac Mini. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vepgj9"&gt;Apple is planning a new model of the Mac Mini that will replace the pro-focused Intel-based model it still sells, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. A “high-end, M1X Mac Mini” is expected “in the next several months,” and is said to have “an updated design and more ports than the current model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itZkyK"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini with its own M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; late last year, but that model was intended as a replacement for the entry-level machines, and consequently had fewer ports than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;higher-end Intel version introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The M1 Mini has two fewer Thunderbolt ports, only one of which can be used for an external display, although a second monitor can still be hooked up over HDMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XvKJ1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Mac mini with M1 review: over-performer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="us03Zf"&gt;If the “M1X” nomenclature is accurate, it would suggest that the new model uses the same generation CPU cores as the M1 (and the A14 Bionic chip used in the iPhone 12), but achieves better performance by having more CPU and GPU cores across a larger chip. That was Apple’s approach to designing the “X” processors for previous iPad models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM0LFU"&gt;The current M1 Mac Mini is a great computer, but it does have its limitations for pro use, and there’s a sense that its design — virtually unchanged since 2010 — could use an overhaul. Gurman has mentioned the prospect of a new Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and he now seems surer than ever that it’s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Eternals, Foundation, The Hand of God, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZA6fBrBg944SdQPWFo-MkE_NSI=/604x0:1756x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69761277/angelina_jolie.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Angelina Jolie stars in Eternals, coming to theaters November 5th. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_me3xsvDgk&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SAp5H3"&gt;I think I have found the max number of streaming shows I can keep up with/commit to at once and that number is three and a half. I just added &lt;em&gt;Manifest&lt;/em&gt; back into the rotation because Netflix dropped season three and &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; ended. Good timing, thanks, streaming channels! A few quick recaps of the past week’s shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWaPsu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; finale. While the theme song will forever haunt me, this deeply unsettling show remained unsettling to the very end. I didn’t love it but I can’t stop thinking about it, so figure that out for me. Kathryn VanArendonk has an interesting &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-white-lotus-finale-mike-white-interview-departures-ending.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;amp;utm_source=tw"&gt;interview in &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with WL creator Mike White who says he accepts the criticism of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZHANn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; episode 5 (official title: &lt;em&gt;Rainbow&lt;/em&gt;): If it makes me a sap, fine, but I loved this rom-communism/Roy Kent-centric episode. Yes, the show has left some fairly significant plot threads (Jamie Tartt, the Dubai Air protest, the team’s financial state) simmering on the back burner for two episodes in favor of its Christmas episode and this latest one, but I don’t think it means they’ve forgotten about those plots (and I have not seen any screeners so I’m coming to each episode the same time as everyone else). And, the latest episode accomplished a very significant plot point with the aforementioned Roy Kent that should add some spiciness to the back half of the season. Just believe, you guys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dyyXZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt;: While Wanda Sykes is a very welcome addition to the show and her character is fascinating, the &lt;em&gt;Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is starting to feel a tiny bit overstuffed with quirkiness. And Wackner’s court is heading in a sinister (and illegal!) direction, which hopefully the show is going to bring full circle soon. Still, Audra McDonald and Christine Baranski make the show worth watching (and Sarah Steele needs a Marissa spinoff, imo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX4Ah4"&gt;On to this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f8JLv8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_me3xsvDgk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEFeb1"&gt;Eternals &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="irSMyY"&gt;Why didn’t the Eternals help the Avengers fight Thanos? Because they were “instructed not to interfere in any human conflicts unless Deviants were involved,” Gemma Chan’s Sersi explains in this trailer. Now the Eternals have to get the band back together to stop the Deviants and they only have seven days. Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Selma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Keoghan, Lia McHugh, Ma Dong-seok, and Lauren Ridloff star in &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Chloe Zhao. It comes to theaters November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wf5Ti4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4QYV5GTz7c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MtKXmj"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3DWsZd"&gt;As my colleague Jay Peters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632413/foundation-apple-tv-plus-trailer-game-of-thrones-energy"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, this trailer for the upcoming science-fiction series based on the Asimov novels has some “&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; but in space” vibes. I actually got a “more serious, scarier &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; with no light-sabers” vibe personally but let’s not have that argument on the internet. Jared Harris stars as Dr. Hari Seldon, who has predicted the fall of the Empire (see?) , and brings a band of loyal followers to the edge of the galaxy to try to rebuild civilization via The Foundation. Lee Pace, Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch also star. The first two episodes of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premiere on Apple TV Plus on September 24th, with the remaining eight episodes arriving weekly after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AQeQuJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFUVnhUsNws?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hz6JEJ"&gt;The Hand of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vO27CJ"&gt;Directed by Oscar-winning Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino, The Hand of God is the story of a young boy in Naples in the 1980s, who is saved from a tragic accident by soccer superstar Diego Maradona. Several years ago Sorrentino told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; the story of how Maradona inadvertently &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2015/film/global/paolo-sorrentino-on-making-youth-and-why-maradona-has-a-special-place-in-his-heart-1201660014/https://variety.com/2015/film/global/paolo-sorrentino-on-making-youth-and-why-maradona-has-a-special-place-in-his-heart-1201660014/"&gt;saved his life&lt;/a&gt;, and has called &lt;em&gt;The Hand of God&lt;/em&gt; his most personal film. Naples looks just beautiful in this trailer, you’ll be unsurprised to hear.  Filippo Scotti, Toni Servillo, Teresa Saponangelo, and Marlon Joubert star in &lt;em&gt;The Hand of God,&lt;/em&gt; which is coming soon to Netflix and theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MraTAE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQO16k5Vdow?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WRTHPu"&gt;Nightbooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u4W0Vw"&gt;Krysten Ritter looks like she is having the time of her life in this trailer, as a witch who orders a young boy trapped in an enchanted (not in the good way) apartment to write scary stories for her every night, OR ELSE. Based on the young adult novel of the same name,&lt;em&gt; Nightbooks&lt;/em&gt; stars Winslow Fegley and Lidya Jewett as two resourceful kids trying to figure out how to defeat the witch once and for all. It comes to Netflix on September 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pCs4TL"&gt;As conditions in Afghanistan continue to deteriorate and the Taliban gain control of its major cities, it’s been a challenge for its citizens to get accurate information about what’s happening from moment to moment. &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/kabul-based-crisis-alert-app-struggles-to-protect-its-own-employees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of Kabul-based startup &lt;a href="https://www.ehtesab.af/"&gt;Ehtesab&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on crowdsourced reports from vetted users to track everything from electricity outages to bombings to traffic jams, and feeds the information to its app, which then sends out push notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cJKQUw"&gt;Ehtesab means “accountability” in Dari and Pashto, and the app, formally launched in March 2020, offers streamlined security-related information, including general security updates in Kabul to its users. With real-time, crowdsourced alerts, users across the city can track bomb blasts, roadblocks, electricity outages, or other problems in locations close to them. The app, which generates push notifications about nearby security risks, is supported by 20 employees working out of the company’s Kabul office, according to [founder Sara] Wahedi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wN5xsd"&gt;Wahedi and her staff are currently working remotely for their safety — she tells &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; even they were surprised by how quickly the Afghan government collapsed — and Ehtesab avoids mentioning the Taliban in its security updates, providing information in a “discreet” way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nMzSAE"&gt;For instance, a roadblock may indicate that there might be danger, but of course we can’t directly say that there is danger. If we are accused of constructing a narrative against the government, then we can assert that we provided information about a roadblock and nothing else, since it affects people’s movement. That is the strategy we are adopting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z3OySX"&gt;It has become more and more difficult to get information in and out of Kabul in recent days, but Wahedi said she felt a responsibility to Afghanistan’s younger generation, who “have grown up in war.” Silence, Wahedi says, “gives the Taliban an upper hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0YX8R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/kabul-based-crisis-alert-app-struggles-to-protect-its-own-employees/"&gt;Go read this story&lt;/a&gt; about what it’s like collecting and disseminating crucial information amidst the chaos in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US orders six commercial airlines to provide planes to transport Afghans and Americans in Middle East</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AaJQvC"&gt;Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III on Sunday activated stage 1 of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), ordering six commercial airlines to provide passenger planes to help evacuate people from US military bases in the Middle East, the Department of Defense said in a &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2741564/department/"&gt;news release. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6Rjmv"&gt;The planes won’t fly in or out of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan, but will help transport Afghans and US citizens who have arrived at bases in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The plan calls for 18 planes total; four from United Airlines, three each from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Airlines, and Omni Air, and two from Hawaiian Airlines. The DoD said in the release it doesn’t expect the CRAF activation to have a major impact on commercial flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyKMne"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/08/22/afghanistan-kabul-taliban-live-updates/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; officials said Sunday that the planes would help move Afghans from the bases in the Middle East to places in Europe, and some to the US. The bases have seen the arrivals of thousands of Afghans trying to flee as the Taliban take over Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htjWGO"&gt;According to the DoD, Sunday is the third time CRAF has been activated; it was first activated during the war in the Persian Gulf in (from August 1990 to May 1991), and during the Iraq war (from February 2002 to June 2003).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook releases shelved content transparency report after criticism it wasn’t being transparent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lid9krPFThHD16u7231T65uUSUU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69759942/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook has released a content transparency report it initially withheld | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQfDZZ"&gt;Facebook released a &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixy9meh6vari4lf/Q1-Content-Transparency-Report-V0-US-internal-copy%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) late Saturday about its most-viewed posts in the first quarter of 2021 that it had initially shelved reportedly because it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634841/facebook-most-viewed-content-report-look-bad"&gt;made the company look bad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehuzFH"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which obtained a copy of the Q1 report before Facebook released it, the most-viewed link on Facebook between January and March of this year was a since-updated news story that suggested a Florida doctor’s death may be linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__w3jh76vv54l"&gt;Facebook policy communications manager Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1429208057947561987?s=20"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the criticism Facebook received for not releasing the report “wasn’t unfair,” but tried to unpack the complexities of how it handled that most-viewed link: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WICBf2"&gt;“News outlets wrote about the south Florida doctor that died. When the coroner released a cause of death, the Chicago Tribune appended an update to its original story; NYTimes did not. Would it have been right to remove the Times story because it was COVID misinfo?” Stone tweeted. “Of course not. No one is actually suggesting this and neither am I. But it does illustrate just how difficult it is to define misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzTytJ"&gt;Stone said Facebook had withheld the January-March report “because there were key fixes to the system we wanted to make.” He didn’t elaborate further on what those fixes were, but tweeted a link to the Q1 report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WlEHpi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On the question of the unreleased report from earlier this year and why we held it. We ended up holding it because there were key fixes to the system we wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Stone (@andymstone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1429209741130096647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxsua0"&gt;What Facebook released on August 18th was a report showing the &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;most-viewed content in its public News Feed from April to June&lt;/a&gt;, its second quarter. It offers a rosier picture of the company; the most-viewed post in Q2 was a word puzzle that invited users to pick out the first three words they saw. The second most-viewed Facebook post between April and June asked users over 30 to post a picture of themselves if they looked young. The most-viewed domains included YouTube, UNICEF, Spotify, and CBS News. Among the top ten most-viewed links on Facebook in Q2 were a &lt;a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2d32d91bcdfa6e17f18df90f1fada473/6094b00761d82f16-76/s400x600/f0383899ecb1484b10e3420a368d871d7dc68f91.gifv"&gt;GIF of kittens&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/unicef-responding-covid-19-india"&gt;UNICEF response page for India’s COVID-19 crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi4GJA"&gt;It’s not totally clear why Facebook decided to release these reports of popular content at all, but criticism of the platform’s handling of misleading COVID-19 information has been mounting in recent weeks. The Biden administration has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;urged Facebook and other social media&lt;/a&gt; platforms to do a better job at dealing with misleading or false information about COVID-19 vaccines on their sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lmvaL"&gt;Another possible motivation for Facebook’s new “transparency” reports is likely the work of &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; tech columnist Kevin Roose&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;who last year began using Facebook-owned content analytics platform &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10"&gt;CrowdTangle to compile and publish daily lists&lt;/a&gt; of the top-performing US Facebook pages, lists which frequently included pages dedicated to former President Trump, and right-leaning pundits like Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. The lists were reportedly a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;source of irritation for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrSuVz"&gt;Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday morning. You can read the full Q1 content transparency report below. &lt;/p&gt;
