    <title>Facebook is giving the Oculus Quest 2 a storage bump and recalling its foam face masks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFr2DIrIZQjIuapGDbZnN6eUEkc=/781x0:9219x5625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639071/Oculus_Quest_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aJU21"&gt;Facebook is pausing worldwide sales of the Oculus Quest 2 while it upgrades the headset’s storage and replaces its foam facial covers with a new silicone design. Starting August 24th, all Quest 2 virtual reality headsets will come with a minimum of 128GB of storage instead of 64GB. They’ll ship with a silicone interface between your face and the headset instead of the old foam design. And all current Quest 2 owners can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2Fremovable-facial-interface-alert%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;request a free silicone mask online&lt;/a&gt; to replace their foam one, thanks to a recall after some users reported skin irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMeFdQ"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth announced the news &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/community-letter/"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “As more people got into VR with Quest 2, we started receiving reports that a very small percentage of Quest 2 customers experienced some skin irritation after using the removable foam facial interface that comes with Quest 2 and is also sold separately, including as a part of the Fit Pack,” Bosworth writes. “While the rate of reports is small and the majority of reported cases are minor, we’re committed to ensuring our products are safe and comfortable for everyone who uses them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71Evny"&gt;The company is now voluntarily recalling all Quest 2 and Quest 2 Fit Pack foam interfaces in cooperation with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Owners can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2Fremovable-facial-interface-alert%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;follow the instructions&lt;/a&gt; on Oculus’ website to get a replacement — you’ll need your account login, headset serial number, and an address in &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/orders-and-purchases/headsets-and-app-purchases/quest-2-supported-countries"&gt;one of its supported countries&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you’re among the majority with no negative reaction, the Quest’s foam headset can soak up sweat during exercise and is tougher to clean than a smooth face cover, so a silicone mask could be a welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV9qw2"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306115601/https://www.oculus.com/blog/customer-support-update-for-quest-2-foam-interface/"&gt;first disclosed the foam irritation issue&lt;/a&gt; in December of 2020, saying that “about 0.01 percent of people” using the Quest 2 experienced temporary redness, bumps, or swelling. It compared the irritation to that sometimes caused by foam in motorcycle helmets or ski goggles, emphasizing that it’s different from the normal indentations or redness you might see from the weight of the headset itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50dB2L"&gt;The Quest 2 storage expansion, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/07/new-rumours-suggest-oculus-quest-2-128gb-on-the-way-may-replace-64gb-model/"&gt;was rumored&lt;/a&gt; last week following a leaked retailer product description. It won’t change the $299 base price of the headset, and Oculus will still offer a 256GB model for $399 when the upgrade launches in August — although after the upgrade, the difference between the two will be less stark.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Ghostbusters: Afterlife trailer will convince you to see this movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZjPZCVLXWKU2qiOgXyyQLVbodY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639060/ghostbusters_afterlife_sequels_1593442404614_160w.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cUboqc"&gt;There’s a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; that gives away more of the setting and plot than anything we’ve seen to date — and boy, does it look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7t8k8r"&gt;After a year of really weird Americana trailers more reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters,&lt;/em&gt; it's nice to see what this movie will actually be about. While early trailers were full of epic music and wide vistas and whispers, this trailer actually has some ghosts! And Annie Potts! And the voice of Dan Aykroyd! This is the first trailer that actually makes the movie feel like a sequel rather than a weird and mopey kid-focused reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URDVhv"&gt;Crucially, besides the welcome cameos from the original Janine Melnitz and Ray Stantz, there are a lot of actual ghosts in this trailer for a movie about the busting of ghosts. There are ghosts getting coffee and ghosts fleeing from the Ectomobile and marshmallow ghosts and an entire river of slime that appears to be coursing under some truly Byzantium ruins that echo the biggest set piece from the original film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90RjLu"&gt;If I can’t have comedy (this movie still looks pretty dang serious), some goofy ghosts and lore will do. And this trailer is loaded with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsTTWV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; will premiere in theaters November 11th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC now has huge performance improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1S77irTtNRCws-Q5UgL97k4CoI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638908/MFS_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUyZW8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting its biggest update ever on PC today, thanks to a new patch that delivers significant performance improvements. The game has been notoriously demanding since its launch last year, but the team behind the simulator has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558803/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-performance-improvements-patch"&gt;focusing heavily on improving its CPU and memory usage&lt;/a&gt;. PC players can now go ahead and download the latest update, and it should improve frame rates across a variety of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKmDWC"&gt;I’ve been testing the update for the past couple of weeks on my own PC, equipped with an Intel Core i9-11900K and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and the improvements are staggering even on top hardware. I use &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for benchmarks during our GPU reviews, and in the same section flying across Seattle, my frame rate has gone from an average of 45fps all the way up to 68fps. That’s more than a 50 percent leap with ultra settings enabled at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdQG3B"&gt;Even flying across areas like New York City sees some impressive improvements, with my machine now managing to hit 80fps average in what’s typically a very demanding part of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. The improvements are so surprising that I’ve had to double and triple check my settings to make sure I was actually running at ultra on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q92WEM4imItfZn642wMa-WP61IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742709/rEsQK2n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying over New York City now feels a lot better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Se3F9W"&gt;Overall, the game now feels a lot smoother with less random fps drops than before. It should also be a lot more playable on a wider range of hardware as a result. Asobo, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demonstrated the game running on an older system with an Intel Core i7-9700K and an RTX 2060 Super earlier this month. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; jumped from around 30fps to nearly a solid 60fps on this PC with the patch, and CPU and memory utilization also dropped significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkZIcR"&gt;“We have rewritten a lot of the parts of the engine ... in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim,” explained Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch earlier this month. The team has been mainly working on CPU optimizations, and it’s clearly worked out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkieIU"&gt;This has all been achieved without a move to DirectX 12, too. While a DirectX 12 version of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; launches on Xbox Series X / S today, the PC version will remain on DirectX 11. That leaves the door open for even more potential improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfCqSC"&gt;The upcoming move to DirectX 12 will also allow Asobo to introduce ray tracing in the game. Effects should include better water, improved shadows, and the usual reflections that are found in ray-traced games. Asobo has not yet confirmed when &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; will move to DirectX 12 on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR5wpS"&gt;“All the performance improvements come from just improving the simulator,” confirmed Wloch earlier this month. “PC has not yet moved to DirectX 12, the team is still working on it. It may bring improvements further, or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn yourself into a cartoon for your next Zoom call</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEcS0Rd9QlEC-L3x4e57KTBWGfI=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638904/cartoon_yourself_zoom.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Linguini from &lt;/em&gt;Ratatouille &lt;em&gt;stuck in endless Zoom meetings&lt;/em&gt;.  | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVFEGH"&gt;Want to make your next quarterly Zoom check-up a little more interesting? Feel like aggravating your colleagues at the virtual all-hands? If so, why not turn yourself into a freakish living cartoon, courtesy of Snapchat’s desktop app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtDLfx"&gt;We’ve written &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276091/zoom-snap-camera-filter-how-to-youtube-cat"&gt;about the Snap Camera app before&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s fun, free, and easy to use. But Snap seems to have updated it recently with the cartoon filter from its mobile app, which is worth a look in its own right. The filter turns you into a generic DreamWorks / Pixar creation, and is surprisingly fluid. Its ability to capture your full range of expressions is a little limited (it can’t quite do a proper &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamworksFace"&gt;DreamWorks Face&lt;/a&gt;, for example) but access through the desktop app means you can now use the filter on your next Zoom call, which is both dumb and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6cT2cadQdVYLmTwfiO3BSJ54i8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743093/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_3.31.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The filter is available through Snap’s Snap Camera desktop app on Mac and PC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LosE7H"&gt;To do so, you need to first download and install the Snap Camera app &lt;a href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/"&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll need to give it access to your microphone and camera, and be running Windows 10 or macOS 10.13 or later). Then, start the app, start Zoom, and make Snap Camera your camera input. To do this on a Mac, click “Preferences” &amp;gt; “Video” in the top menu. If you’re on a PC, click the gear icon in the upper-right of the app then select “Video.” Then, from the drop-down menu labeled “Camera,” select “Snap Camera” rather than your current input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jewRwM"&gt;Next, go to the Snap Camera app itself and select the filter you want from the carousel underneath the camera feed. This one is called “Cartoon Style.” Click it and you should be good to go. A little tip: you can click the video or create a custom hotkey (defined under the video feed) to switch between different cartoon styles. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08 Sport earbuds have wireless charging and a Kevlar case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EE2WUYErs7X0uucvtvpeWfhD3U=/1x0:1356x903/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638842/masterdynamic.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x98xB5"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has announced the latest addition to its distinctive lineup of true wireless earbuds. The new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fmw08-sport-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earphones&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22595944%2Fmaster-dynamics-mw08-sport-earbuds-announced-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MW08 Sport noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/a&gt; are available today for $349, a $50 price increase over the standard MW08 buds released earlier this year. The extra money gets you three main benefits: wireless charging, a redesigned case with a Kevlar finish, and the addition of foam ear tips in the box. They come in black, white, blue, or green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GnLpL"&gt;Despite “sport” being tacked on to their name, these earbuds still closely resemble the MW08 in design — though Master &amp;amp; Dynamic says it’s using sapphire glass this time instead of the ceramic from the regular MW08s. If you’ve ever wanted earbuds that are essentially scratch-proof, here you go. The company claims they’re also shatter-resistant and ready for your most intense workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPFkXS"&gt;The buds are rated IPX5 for water and sweat resistance, which matches the MW08s. Instead of coming with the same shiny, instantly smudgy stainless steel case as Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s previous earbuds, these include a redesigned case made from woven Kevlar fiber. Even the case can handle some of your sweat, thanks to an IPX4 rating. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHcaqZ5uWepRGT2DSDCz3VbTOog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743046/md.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DdKmLi"&gt;The rest of the tech specs (and sound quality) remain unchanged from the MW08; you get 10 hours of continuous listening with ANC enabled or 12 with it off. The charging case nets you an additional 30 hours. Master &amp;amp; Dynamic includes two modes each for noise cancellation and ambient sound. The star of the show remains the 11mm Beryllium acoustic drivers, and like the MW08s, these earbuds have Bluetooth 5.2 and external antennas for optimal wireless performance and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROGuhC"&gt;Aside from the normal silicone ear tips, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is also bundling in two sizes of memory foam tips. The company says these are ideal for workouts, but I often stick to them full-time if I can’t get a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; seal with any of the included silicone options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AT2CCOhHSS2MDP3RRPaCTzaYQIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743065/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_10.38.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="657QxK"&gt;Since its latest earbuds are now capable of wireless charging — another benefit of switching away from the metal case — Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fwireless-charge-pad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22595944%2Fmaster-dynamics-mw08-sport-earbuds-announced-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;releasing a very nice charging pad&lt;/a&gt; for $69 in either gray or black; it tops out at 10 watts of power for your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord now has Threads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrBzCfnfZTSvTSZCHbeQhe0b2LE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638733/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sW1vwj"&gt;Discord is launching its Threads feature today to allow servers to improve the back-and-forth of conversations on the service. Threads is distinctly different from the Replies feature that Discord introduced last year, and users will be able to create new threaded conversations using a new “#” option across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2InWF"&gt;Threads work very similar to how they do in many other chat clients, allowing Discord users to branch off a conversation away from a main channel feed. A separate feed is generated for threaded conversations, and Discord server admins will be able to control which members of a server can participate in threads. Moderators will even be able to remove people from threads if they’re being troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRu47n-thGflXLIlCBvrrOtx9B4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742905/image3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Discord Threads feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oNcnO"&gt;Discord is also introducing both public and private threads. Public threads in a channel will let any members with the send messages permission start and reply to threads, but private threads will allow certain members to create and chat in private. You’ll be able to @ invite people into a private thread or manually add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLLul9"&gt;Discord will automatically archive threads within 24 hours to try to reduce the clutter for channels. You’ll still be able to read threads in an archive tab, but you won’t be able to reply to them once they’re archived. Server admins can configure this up to three days for archive by default, but if a server is boosted to level 2 with Nitro boosts, then private threads and a one-week archive option will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gepd3C"&gt;Threads will open up into a split-view panel in Discord, with an option to see a thread full-screen by clicking on it in the channel list. In a busy server, that does mean the channel list could be about to grow in size if users create multiple threads. But the overall goal is to avoid the headache of multiple different conversations happening at once in a single channel, and threads will certainly be useful for the more active Discord servers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The careful balancing act of translating an Ace Attorney game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ofJRNVNxJSsnITK7A18aEzrjbr0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638728/TGAAC_Ryunosuke_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A chat with localization director Janet Hsu&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4Lrd8P"&gt;The success of the long-running &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series hinges on great writing. Like most visual novel-style games, the quirky legal dramas involve a lot of text, with players reading dialogue and poring over clues in order to help their seemingly doomed clients. This means that localization is particularly important — as each new entry is translated from Japanese to English, localizers need to make it approachable for a new audience while retaining what makes it special in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SF1qh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557963/great-ace-attorney-chronicles-preview-hands-on-switch-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest entry in the franchise, provided an extra challenge. While most titles take place in the modern day, the new game jumps back in time to near the end of the 19th century and features characters and plotlines connected to both Meiji-era Japan and Victorian England. “I think the more difficult parts of this game’s localization lie in the way the historical context compounds the cross-cultural issues,” says localization director Janet Hsu. Against this backdrop, there’s a new lead character, Ryunosuke Naruhodo who replaces mainstay Phoenix Wright, and stories full of death, surprise, and all kinds of wonderfully terrible puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN4m2h"&gt;The game — which is actually a collection of two titles that released in Japan in 2015 and 2017 — is only finally coming out for English-speaking audiences this week. Ahead of launch, I had the chance to ask Hsu a few questions about dealing with regional differences, keeping the story accessible, and the challenges of text versus voice acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBKaJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSVQ2OdErPDkqPS7SLm9u1_rffY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741251/TGAAC_Courtroom_02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0Sar8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you go about making the dialogue feel period-appropriate but also accessible for a modern audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCk5zB"&gt;Making the text feel period-appropriate while remaining accessible is a real balancing act, for sure. One of the ways we’ve re-created that style of writing is by using older grammar structures for certain characters’ speaking styles, while with others, it might be by using certain words. But even with slightly older words, we only ever used ones that are still in use today; nothing should be so strange or obsolete that it requires players to look up the actual period definition in a dictionary. We also actively avoided words that are too modern or American in origin, so there might be a few places where people might think, “Isn’t there a more idiomatic way of saying this?” But it’s all part of preserving the overall style. In fact, you’d be surprised just how much of our modern style of English was only created in the last 100 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="na3RCO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We only ever used ones that are still in use today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GBIB1"&gt;We also took care to balance each line’s accessibility with its importance in the larger scheme of the story or a puzzle to be solved. Places where it’s more flavor text than critical puzzle text might feature more flourishes. However, no matter what type it is, people should be able to work out what a word means through context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0xE7n"&gt;At the end of the day, what is accessible will also somewhat depend on each player’s knowledge base and life experience. I do realize, for example, that perhaps some of our younger players might not know off the top of their heads some of the higher-level words that a university student might know through more years of schooling. However, it is my hope that this game will be something people can revisit over and over and enjoy anew each time. Just as someone might see this game in a new light culturally if they come to live or work in Japan or the UK, so too might a player more fully enjoy the text once they have had more exposure to this sort of writing, I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu8nbu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like having to localize a story that involves two very different cultures with Japan and the UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4vVks"&gt;Luckily, it wasn’t as hard as you’d think due to a number of factors. The first is that [writer and director Shu Takumi] is very familiar with 19th century London, thanks to his love of classic British mystery novels. He and the original development team did their due diligence and researched everything they needed to know about both Meiji Japan and Victorian London to make the story work. From there, the UK-based English translators and I were able to simply take the Japanese and run with it. Naturally, for the UK-based translators, writing about their own culture was a lot easier than me as an American trying to do the same. That is actually one of the reasons I chose to work with Plus Alpha Translations to begin with, in addition to their history of stellar localizations. For the cross-cultural aspects, figuring out how to present them was a no-brainer for me since I’ve been doing it all my life. Growing up in a very Taiwanese household in America means I have a lot of experience “translating” culturally Asian concepts into something more relatable to someone with a more European background and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A0HnQK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was hesitant to over-explain things”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNIgTT"&gt;So more than the locations of Japan and the UK, I think the more difficult parts of this game’s localization lie in the way the historical context compounds the cross-cultural issues. Because the 19th century London setting is something quite literally foreign to Japanese players, there were some great bits of world-building written into the Japanese text to provide cultural explanations. On the other hand, however, there was significantly less information provided about Meiji Japan or it wasn’t explained in as much detail because a lot of it is assumed to be common knowledge. In fact, the opening anime’s very first line in the Japanese version simply says, “A few decades after that history-making opening of the country...” A Japanese audience wouldn’t need to be told this is referring to Japan since they use the word “kaikoku” (開国 / literally “opening the country”), which is more than enough to set up the where and when. But for a Western audience, I felt that this simply wouldn’t be enough information to go on, so we made it very clear that this was Japan and tried to strengthen the impression provided by the Japanese text of just how turbulent the times were in Japanese society through the narration’s writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXTjwK"&gt;Even still, I was hesitant to over-explain things as it would drag the tempo of the story down, so the translators and I tried to sneak in what we could to hopefully provide enough background for the game to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLZEwi1164vhH5gRBftDkWLHAq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741267/TGAAC_Dance_of_Deduction_01_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z7fSs1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems like audiences, particularly for a series like this, understand localization much more than in the past. Is this something you’ve noticed? And how, if at all, does that influence your approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RIa8y"&gt;With art and entertainment, I believe there is a relationship of sorts between creators and their audience through a piece of work. Having come from the world of fanworks and fandom myself, I’ve always been very aware of the many differing opinions on localization in general, and what the prevailing expectations among fans of all stripes are as the years go by. It’s been amazing to watch how trends have changed as professionals and fans alike debate the merits of different localization approaches. The fact that these sorts of discussions are taking place at all is fantastic, and it is definitely not something that happened to this extent when I first started localizing games over 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfnwo3"&gt;This greater awareness of localization has led me to trust my audience to think and understand a great deal more about why something might have been changed, or why a certain approach has been taken. Of course, this also means that I am very careful not to betray that trust, so I always make sure every decision I take is necessary and justifiable. But localization is also a creative process, which means not every decision I make will please every player, so it’s also a constant learning process for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qqIyDf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted to make the most of this chance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aCr3t9"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; being a standalone title that is not connected to the previous games, I wanted to make the most of this chance to make this localization something more in line with the standards of today. In the past, the complete localization philosophy worked extremely well in making foreign-made entertainment accessible to a wider audience. However, thanks in part to the internet and machine translation software such as Google Translate, it’s easier than ever to learn about other languages and cultures and enjoy foreign movies and other forms of entertainment. But that isn’t to say there is no place for complete localizations anymore, either. Just look at all of the regional remakes of TV dramas and movies that are still being produced to great popularity today. Ultimately, I think what the furtherance of understanding surrounding localization has done is it’s opened up a whole range of new avenues — new options and approaches in addition to the existing older approaches that we can consider and use in localizing pieces of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZowtFV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much did you have to worry about localization choices that were made in past games? Did they limit your options in any way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPoLkM"&gt;For this game, it didn’t worry me much at all. While there were a few very small references that were lost, I think the only major issue was what to do about Phoenix Wright and Ryunosuke Naruhodo’s familial relationship. But given how I’ve localized the mainline games to be a more Japanese-influenced version of California, it made it very easy and also made a lot of sense to simply make Ryunosuke into Phoenix’s ancestor and preserve the intended relationship from the Japanese version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQvTJ9"&gt;Actually, I suppose there’s also the issue of Prosecutor Auchi and his relation to the Payne brothers, but we’ve had Prosecutor Flynch in &lt;em&gt;Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,&lt;/em&gt; so I figured that connection’s probably not going to be too “painful” for players to make on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlOA2pL8_8Mxx4t8UsqXILR5BuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741269/TGAAC_Courtroom_01_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Cqv2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the team? How many people are involved in localizing and translating a game like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eN7tww"&gt;For the localization of this title, we had a small team of staff here in our Japan branch along with our translators in the UK. In addition, we also had a team of linguistic QA testers who checked and tightened up our text. All in all, it was a long process. But with a story-heavy game like this, too many cooks spoil the broth, as they say, so slow and steady it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbgkrh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does there being voiced elements change things at all? Do you localize differently depending on whether the dialogue is spoken or text?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvhMOJ"&gt;Just so there’s no misunderstanding, this title is not fully voiced, but there are a number of anime and real-time in-game cutscenes that are fully voiced. In addition, some new gameplay systems have enabled us to employ short voice clips to give our characters more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eJFsGL"&gt;That said, there is absolutely a difference in the way we write the lines when they’re spoken versus when it is text alone. This is due to what voice acting can convey that text alone cannot. For example, the translators wrote some really funny deadpan lines, but a few of them ended up being so dry that you could mistakenly interpret them to mean something completely different. Had those lines been voiced, I’m sure an actor’s deadpan delivery would have made it unmistakable that they’re meant to be jokes. That’s why the dialogue in a text-based game can sometimes sound a little off when read out loud since it has to be written in a way to properly convey its intended tone without the help of an actor’s delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFFTNs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwqz4Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is making accounts for users under 16 private by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OoUryKtebPxofpqD19jq08MvOKg=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638629/CD21_471_IG_In_line.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook is making Instagram safer for young people while developing Instagram for under-13s. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8svW3F"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram is introducing changes designed to make the app safer for young people. From now on, anyone signing up to the service who’s under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will have their account set to private by default, though the option to switch to public will still be available. Anyone under these ages with a public account now will be sent a notification encouraging them to switch to private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZBQrL"&gt;Instagram has been edging toward making private accounts default for young people for a while. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333580/instagram-bans-adults-messaging-teens-safety-notice-prompt"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, it started showing young people signing up to Instagram a message extolling the virtues of having a private account. Now, it’s making private the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iGkRlv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers will only be able to target people under 18 based on their age, gender, and location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGsDiR"&gt;Facebook the company is also introducing changes to how advertisers can target users under the age of 18. Previously, any user could be targeted based on their interests and activity; information that Facebook collects &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ways-facebook-tracks-you-limit-it/"&gt;from across the web&lt;/a&gt;, not just its own properties, analyzing individuals’ web browsing history, app usage, and the like. Now, advertisers will only be able to target under-18 users based on their age, gender, and location. This applies to users on Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb5Z68"&gt;On Instagram, the company says it’s also doing more to limit how problematic users interact with users under 16 years old. The company says it’s able to identify “potentially suspicious behavior” from accounts. This means the account may have been recently blocked or reported by a younger person, for example. These suspicious users will be virtually separated from users under 16: they won’t be shown under-16 accounts in their Explore, Reels, or Accounts Suggested For You pages, nor will they see comments from users under 16 on others’ posts or be able to comment on content from users younger than 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6JSop"&gt;“We are trying to figure out if an adult is exhibiting suspicious behavior,” Instagram’s head of public policy, Karina Newton, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-s-new-protections-teens-come-experts-say-tween-venture-n1275069"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. “The adult might not have broken the rules yet, but might be doing things that make us look at them more deeply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ujcqY"&gt;Instagram previously used its ability to identify suspicious accounts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333580/instagram-bans-adults-messaging-teens-safety-notice-prompt"&gt;warn teens&lt;/a&gt; when they received a direct message from one of these users. It also blocked adults from messaging teens who don’t already follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4llHV"&gt;At the same time as Facebook is trying to make Instagram safer and more private for teenagers, it’s still working on developing an app for kids under 13 (the current minimum age to sign up for Instagram). The plans were first reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, and were met with widespread criticism and complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaIcS8"&gt;Instagram’s Newton told NBC News that Instagram’s under-13 app was still being worked on and that the company was in “deep consultation with experts in child development and privacy advocates” to meet the “needs of families and youth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOwL8H"&gt;Said Newton: “We’re looking to build something that’s compelling for tweens and works for parents.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Joby Aviation’s electric air taxi complete a 150-mile flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cupr_qOWdSn59_XVg8qeSdQlW-c=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638491/Joby_aircraft.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0F9iUM"&gt;Electric air taxis aren’t a real thing yet, but a host of well-financed startups are out to change that. Chief among them is Joby Aviation, an electric aviation company based in Northern California that just posted a noteworthy video of its six-rotor aircraft completing an impressive 150-mile flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEvLu"&gt;Granted, it doesn’t sound too impressive, but it’s actually among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft. It’s equivalent to a trip between Seattle and Vancouver, or Los Angeles to San Diego — the type of regional trip conducted hundreds of times a day by regional partners to major airlines. Swapping out those polluting airplanes for a zero-emissions aircraft like Joby’s could be a major step toward the reduction of CO2 emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kOIeP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;among the longest flights ever performed by an electric aircraft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i29d2p"&gt;The company, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;backed by Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;acquired Uber’s flying taxi division&lt;/a&gt;, has said that it plans to have a full-scale air taxi service in operation by 2024, including regional trips. The point of the 150-mile flight was to demonstrate how far its aircraft could fly on a single charge, to allay concerns about the vehicle’s range and battery. If you want to fly from New York City to Montauk, Joby wanted to show that it can get you there without running out of juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nT2B4l"&gt;“We’ve achieved something that many thought impossible with today’s battery technology,” JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, said in a statement. “By doing so we’ve taken the first step towards making convenient, emissions-free air travel between places like San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, Houston and Austin, or Los Angeles and San Diego an everyday reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DdfO6V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xysDJ6"&gt;Rather than fly between two points, Joby’s aircraft flew in a 14-mile circle 11 times for a total flight time of one hour and 17 minutes. It’s an impressive feat, given the challenges of electric flight. The power-to-weight ratio is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;biggest inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a given system — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground. To weigh it out: jet fuel gives us about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk8aIO"&gt;But Joby says that its commercially available lithium-ion batteries have been specially adapted for aerospace uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="56LfSK"&gt;An 811 NMC cathode and a graphite anode cell were selected, following internal testing, to deliver the optimal trade-off between the specific energy required to fly the aircraft 150 miles, the specific power to take-off and land vertically and the cycle life to deliver an affordable service. We have demonstrated in the lab that this battery is capable of more than 10,000 of our expected nominal flight cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="90FfoL"&gt;The team developing Joby’s energy system is led by Jon Wagner, head of powertrain and electronics, who previously led battery engineering at Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdjhrp"&gt;It helps that Joby is starting small with a five-seater vehicle. Higher capacity aircraft won’t come until the energy density in the current batteries improves. But Joby has a financial buffer, having just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;gone public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. As part of the deal, Joby will get $1.6 billion in cash, which it will use to continue to tinker and perfect its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRdygE"&gt;The question is: will it be enough to get the company to 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="raXxxl"&gt;Sony has announced the ZV-E10, an APS-C interchangeable lens camera it hopes will appeal to the needs of vloggers. It brings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;many of the features we liked from the fixed-lens ZV-1&lt;/a&gt; into a bigger sensor format, including shortcuts to focus and exposure settings vloggers may need to access quickly. Being a bigger camera, there are also some significant benefits that the pocketable ZV-1 didn’t have the real estate to accommodate, like a headphone jack, better battery life, and a larger sensor with more depth-of-field flexibility. And at $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens, it’s a pretty good deal — just over the ZV-1’s current $749 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b0f0n"&gt;While the ZV-E10 addresses many of our complaints with the ZV-1, the latter still has one feature not offered in the new camera: hardware-based image stabilization. While the ZV-1 included stabilization built into the lens, the ZV-E10 only offers electronic stabilization. To supplement this, it also includes the ability to record gyro sensor data in metadata that can be utilized when applying stabilization in post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LGv8qH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10671612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oHpaCL"&gt;The ZV-E10 offers a 24.2-megapixel sensor with a native ISO range of 100-32,000 equipped with the excellent eye and subject-tracking AF that both the ZV-1 and Sony’s recent interchangeable-lens cameras offer. It also includes the ZV-1’s vlogger-friendly Bokeh Switch mode, which toggles the aperture to blur your background or bring it into focus, as well as a Product Showcase mode to apply AF settings best suited for presenting products on camera. There’s a fully articulated touchscreen display for easier operation from in front of the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9EWzA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XnhV8"&gt;Video recording tops out at 4K / 30p and is taken from oversampled 6K footage. Hybrid log-gamma, S-Log2, and S-Log3 profiles are included for videographers who plan to grade footage after capture. Slow-motion footage can be recorded up to 1080 / 120p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gflbTl"&gt;Microphone and 3.5mm headphone jacks are included, and a three-capsule directional microphone is built in with a windscreen included in the box. Livestreaming via USB is supported for phones with Android 11, though not yet available with iOS devices. The ZV-E10 claims up to 80 minutes of video recording on a single battery charge, which is almost double the ZV-1’s claimed 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlmhce"&gt;The Sony ZV-1 will go on sale in August for $699 body-only or $799 with a 16-50mm kit lens.&lt;/p&gt;
