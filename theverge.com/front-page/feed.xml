    <title>Amazon says new FTC chair shouldn’t regulate it because she’s too mean</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/921OtduGrYj6pSPoyRHuGFbd2b8=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525849/1232438982.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3j6q5"&gt;Amazon is pushing back against Lina Khan, the newly confirmed chair of the Federal Trade Commission, by filing a recusal motion against the longtime antitrust advocate, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-lina-khan-in-antitrust-investigations-of-company-11625067962"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The petition asks Khan to restrict herself from any proceedings involving Amazon on the basis of her past statements about the company, including claims that Amazon is a monopoly and should be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJCMX0"&gt;“[Federal ethics rules] require recusal when a new Commissioner previously has expressed views that go beyond general policy commentary and has made statements about specific factual and legal issues relating to a particular company,” the petition reads. “Chair Khan has made numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements regarding Amazon, including on market definition, specific conduct and theories of harm, and the purpose, effects, and legality of such conduct. Indeed, she has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mSUwsi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AvSyO3"&gt;It’s unlikely that Amazon’s petition will succeed. Recusal petitions against FTC commissioners are rarely successful, and it’s common for an FTC chair to have previously worked for nonprofit groups or as a congressional staffer. The petition highlights an unusually high number of public editorials by Khan, but even those are well within the limits of political commentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x428oR"&gt;More importantly, Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;was confirmed with bipartisan support&lt;/a&gt; specifically because of her influential anti-Amazon views, which are increasingly widely held in Congress. The Senate wants the FTC to push back on Amazon, and Khan’s previous statements about the company are a big part of why she got the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1dS9E"&gt;That doesn’t mean Khan will be able to do everything she wants: the courts are a huge check on the FTC’s power, as the commission just found out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;in its case against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. But with backing from both the White House and Congress, she’s earned the chance to try. The real message of today’s petition is that Amazon will be fighting that agenda every chance they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uTN7z1"&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s Revvl V Plus 5G offers a huge display and battery with a tiny $199 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPwSFHkhNKNr8Mf8QgigKb2R2nk=/0x0:1666x1111/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525847/revvl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newest Revvl phone offers 5G, a massive 6.8-inch screen, and a rear-facing triple camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ken1yu"&gt;The year of cheap 5G phones is upon us, and T-Mobile is offering its customers yet another low-cost 5G phone with today’s announcement of the Revvl V Plus 5G. The T-Mobile-branded device will cost $199, with a huge 6.8-inch 1600 x 900 display and 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale first through &lt;a href="https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/revvl-best-budget-smartphones"&gt;Metro by T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; starting on July 12th, with sales through T-Mobile starting on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsBwsY"&gt;The Revvl V Plus 5G comes with Android 11 and uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor designed with inexpensive 5G phones in mind. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM plus 64GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via microSD. It offers a main 16-megapixel rear-facing camera along with two more unspecified 5-megapixel and 2-megapixel sensors on the back as well as a 16-megapixel selfie camera. There is, of course, 5G connectivity available, and while you won’t get the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss; it’s hard to find), you do get access to T-Mobile’s more widespread and relatively strong sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NzrWNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2PXtdy"&gt;The V Plus 5G undercuts the OnePlus N200 5G — another inexpensive big-screen-big-battery 5G phone — by about $15 to $40, depending on where you buy it. (It’s $216 through T-Mobile and $239 unlocked from OnePlus.) The N200 5G is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;our current top pick&lt;/a&gt; for T-Mobile customers looking for 5G on the cheap. And while the Revvl offers some similar features at a lower price, it will be hard pressed to match the N200’s very good 1080p 90Hz display. What we can say for sure is that the 5G price of entry continues to drop, and it likely won’t be long before we see 5G devices priced well under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShcyZS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s Watch Parties feature is rolling out to Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGx-W9wEOMnHE30ccmH7uaW45YU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525666/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9zopfG"&gt;Amazon-owned Twitch is rolling out its Watch Parties feature, which lets streamers host viewing parties for movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, to Android and iOS, the company announced Wednesday. Watch Parties first launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418599/twitch-watch-party-rollout-global-amazon-prime-video-streaming"&gt;desktop web in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgU6jS"&gt;While Watch Parties are a potentially fun way for Twitch streamers to hang out with their communities, there’s one important catch: only viewers who also have an Amazon Prime or Prime Video subscription &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/watch-parties?language=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Watch_Parties_M4&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=763455050422471806&amp;amp;utm_medium=Help+Page&amp;amp;utm_source=Creator+Updates#join"&gt;can join&lt;/a&gt; the party to watch what’s being shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEzGAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch Parties are now rolling out on an Android or iOS device near you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about Watch Parties, including how to host your own, check out the help article at &lt;a href="https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6"&gt;https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5aQC9It02G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5aQC9It02G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1410285296718028803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRV4aI"&gt;But with the expansion to Android and iOS, Twitch is offering more devices from which streamers can host Watch Parties, meaning you might see more of your favorite creators using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWnPEr"&gt;Virtual watch parties have become popular due to the pandemic, and other streaming platforms such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; have introduced their own watch party features. Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;add SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you watch content with other people over FaceTime — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;as long as apps support the feature, that is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood saddled with historic $70 million fine from financial regulators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGDzmfErEDe42eyh9My9T2yo86s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525584/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DtYWLv"&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s fining Robinhood almost $70 million to settle charges over issues it identified with the company’s stock trading service. The authority claims that the financial app company neglected its duty to supervise trades, maintain its own technology, and protect its customers. The fine is the largest in FINRA’s history and Robinhood has agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bF0ubY"&gt;FINRA says since 2016 Robinhood has periodically provided false and misleading information on topics like whether customers were able to place trades on margin (using credit from Robinhood to buy shares), including displaying inaccurate information in its app on how much cash was in customers’ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pUQ6zZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s lack of customer communication has caused problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J1Get4"&gt;The authority’s announcement doesn’t specifically identify the case, but it does appear to obliquely reference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273600/robinhood-alex-kearns-wrongful-death-lawsuit-stock-options-trading"&gt;the death of Alex Kearns&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide after finding a negative $730,000 balance in his Robinhood account from unintentional margin trades. Robinhood was sued following Kearns’ death and ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fswlc6"&gt;FINRA also takes issue with Robinhood’s reliance on algorithms to approve customers for options trading and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163048/robinhood-outages-major-2-days-leap-year-investing"&gt;the outages the platform has suffered&lt;/a&gt;, locking customers out of their accounts “during a time of historic market volatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGmc75"&gt;For those errors and failing to report customer complaints to FINRA, the financial authority is requiring Robinhood to pay a $57 million fine and $12.6 million in restitution to affected customers. Robinhood hasn’t owned up to FINRA’s complaints or denied them, but it did say in a statement that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ji93r2"&gt;We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HRKV8X"&gt;The timing for all of this is pretty poor for Robinhood. While FINRA doesn’t directly take issue with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the company’s role in the rush to buy GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;Robinhood is expected to go public soon&lt;/a&gt;, and a multimillion-dollar fine is kind of a gigantic blemish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igHMqN"&gt;Robinhood is attempting to address some of FINRA’s problems without fully acknowledging them. In &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com"&gt;a company blog post&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday, Robinhood announced it’s expanding its customer support team, planning on offering “enhanced in-app educational resources,” and attempting to address the issues around providing accurate customer information and supervision on trades. Your guess is as good as mine whether that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNCl5l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wow, there sure are a lot of sports on during the workday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Day Two: The Championships - Wimbledon 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/amO5SgR7v5VcdCDJ_XlFvzvtS-Q=/0x0:3267x2178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525399/1326135110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfIM2m"&gt;Right now, you could wake up and turn on Wimbledon. By the afternoon, there will be Euro matches. And then, in the evenings, we’ve had some thrillingly chaotic basketball — both men’s and women’s, plus hockey and baseball and the Tour de France. What a time to be alive (and working from home)! Best of all: it’s all streaming, and I think finally, in 2021, we’re in a place where it’s relatively effortless to watch sports without being tethered to the dregs of convoluted cable packages. Is this the golden age of watching sports during the workday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdqC9b"&gt;I mean, I wouldn’t know. Because I, like all staffers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, am an extremely diligent employee and would never do anything that would distract me throughout the entire workday. Bosses, if you’re reading this, the reason I am not responding to your Slack messages has nothing to do with our secret and very active sports channel. No, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691747/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_12.43.00_PM.png"&gt;I am probably updating Asana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KLEvd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine telling your loved ones “Great news: we now have a trial FuboTV subscription”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="91yi4e"&gt;Besides, though it might be easier than ever, watching sports in 2021 means signing up for a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244771/streaming-services-niche-crunchyroll-ovid-acorn-tv"&gt;confusingly named streaming services&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine telling your loved ones “Great news: we now have a trial FuboTV subscription” and then having to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691784/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1.03.29_PM.png"&gt;explain what FuboTV is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bit like Candyman rules. If you say FuboTV three times in your household, your partner leaves you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n6Qn"&gt;Or it means spending an arm and a leg on YouTube TV, assuming your arm and leg are worth, collectively, $64.99 a month. (Though for the summer, I personally think it would be worth my two remaining limbs given you’ll be able to stream nearly all the sports in one place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="397vFu"&gt;Okay, yes, it’s never been simpler to stream live sports. But this is all moot, because I remain attentive and focused on my work and am absolutely not streaming Euro matches during my Zoom meetings. If you see my eyes drift to the right, know that it is not because the YouTube TV app is open on an iPad propped up beside my laptop. I just have a weird eye thing that happens when a meeting drags on for more than three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Af8i"&gt;And for the co-workers who, earlier this week, heard me mutter “holy shit what the fuck” while I was accidentally unmuted in the middle of a video production call, it had nothing to do with Spain’s keeper whiffing an embarrassingly easy passback and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/06/28/spain-own-goal-euro/"&gt;letting the ball roll into the goal&lt;/a&gt;. No, I was just responding dramatically to, uh, whatever it was that we were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSZIDd"&gt;Since I am explaining myself, let me address a couple other instances: a few weeks back, did I turn in edits to a writer late because I was so enthralled with a Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic French Open semifinal match? The timing may seem coincidental, but those notes came in late because I had a migraine. The migraine just happened to last exactly the amount of time that it took for Nadal and Djokovic to complete what is now considered by many to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrissieEvert/status/1403452352091283462"&gt;one of the greatest sets of tennis ever played&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGqXvv"&gt;And during the all-staff meeting, when I was furiously pounding my desk and chanting “COCO! COCO! COCO!” — that had nothing to do with Coco Gauff’s tight first-round Wimbledon victory over Francesca Jones. I merely thought someone had asked me what my favorite Pixar movie was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsgXtP"&gt;Oh, and just a fair warning for later this month. My internet provider has alerted me that they will be doing scheduled maintenance. So my connection might be spotty, and I may be hard to reach, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+are+the+olympics&amp;amp;oq=when+are+the+olympics&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i131i433l2j0l5j0i131i433j0.2695j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;starting on July 23rd and going through August 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VNqnrn"&gt;
&lt;p id="J5fH3r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article called the soccer tournament the EuroCup. It’s the Euros. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCMh9N"&gt;The state of Maine now has the most stringent laws regulating government use of facial recognition in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymjgca"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP1174&amp;amp;item=2&amp;amp;snum=130"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; prohibits government use of facial recognition except in specifically outlined situations, with the most broad exception being if police have probable cause that an unidentified person in an image committed a serious crime, or for proactive fraud prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jLTUa"&gt;Since Maine police will not have access to facial recognition, they will be able to ask the FBI and Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) to run these searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHShv9"&gt;Crucially, the law plugs loopholes that police have used in the past to gain access to the technology, like informally &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/secret-emails-reveal-how-washington-state-cops-shared-facial-recognition-tech-db8a799c6de6"&gt;asking other agencies&lt;/a&gt; or third parties to run backchannel searches for them. Logs of all facial recognition searches by the BMV must be created and are designated as public records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtuWAP"&gt;The ACLU trumpeted this new law as a major win for state action to block facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdCcbw"&gt;“Maine is showing the rest of the country what it looks like when we the people are in control of our civil rights and civil liberties, not tech companies that stand to profit from widespread government use of face surveillance technology,” Michael Kebede, a lawyer at the ACLU of Maine, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/maine-enacts-strongest-statewide-facial-recognition-regulations-country"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7nLVC"&gt;The only other state-wide facial recognition law was enacted by Washington in 2020, but many privacy advocates were dissatisfied with the specifics of the law.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Washington law gives police &lt;a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/story/we-need-face-surveillance-moratorium-not-weak-regulations-concerns-about-sb-6280"&gt;generous carve-outs&lt;/a&gt; to conduct surveillance with the technology and also allows the technology to be used to deny access to services like housing or education enrollment. Notably, it was written by State Senator Joe Nguyen, who is a &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/a-microsoft-employee-literally-wrote-washingtons-facial-recognition-legislation-aab950396927"&gt;current employee of Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sf8cz"&gt;Virginia and Massachusetts legislatures have also banned some police use of facial recognition, but both fall short of regulating the tech in schools and other state agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcsgRp"&gt;Maine’s new law also gives citizens the ability to sue the state if they’ve been unlawfully targeted by facial recognition, which was notably absent from Washington’s regulation. If facial recognition searches are performed illegally, they must be deleted and cannot be used as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCsKPG"&gt;The law was enacted after passing state legislature and will not require a signature from Maine Governor Janet Mills. It will go into effect on October 1st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Simpsons is getting a Loki short because Disney owns everything</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKZdeTHOcJ642K0OOYGiluFGSLg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525315/image002__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYAxuy"&gt;Disney’s IP has once again fully synergized with the arrival of a new Marvel-themed &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; short titled “The Good, The Bart, and The Loki.” Disney very much appears to be putting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154508/simpsons-avengers-episode-poster-21st-century-fox-acquisition"&gt;$71 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in IP from 21st Century Fox to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EweuQN"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/loki-simpsons-short-premieres-july-7"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that the special will debut July 7th exclusively on its streaming service Disney Plus. Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, will also voice Loki in the &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC8UuH"&gt;Because Disney owns everything and we’ve evidently reached peak content, the key art for the animated short is styled similarly to that of Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; — which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154508/simpsons-avengers-episode-poster-21st-century-fox-acquisition"&gt;not even the first time&lt;/a&gt; Disney has done this. But Lisa as Thor and Ralph Wiggum as Hulk raise a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMiY5T"&gt;Per Disney’s announcement, the special will center on Loki’s banishment from Asgard as he faces “his toughest opponents yet: the Simpsons and Springfield’s mightiest heroes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18kXRF"&gt;Look, &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; has always been a stage onto which its corporate overlords like to thrust other company-owned characters. Other Fox characters like Hank Hill from &lt;em&gt;King of the Hill&lt;/em&gt;, Jay Sherman from &lt;em&gt;The Critic&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Griffin from &lt;em&gt;Family Guy,&lt;/em&gt; and even Mulder and Scully from the live-action &lt;em&gt;X-Files&lt;/em&gt;, all appeared on the show for some peak corporate synergy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk2LET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; also got a May 4th special titled “The Force Awakens from Its Nap” in which Maggie Simpson found herself “on an epic quest for her stolen pacifier.” For those interested, the special is still &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fmaggie-simpson-in-the-force-awakens-from-its-nap%2F2pjsLoN9XE9q&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streamable&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus. The Avengers and &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; also previously collided in “&lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/the-simpsons-season-31-avengers-crossover"&gt;Bart the Bad Guy&lt;/a&gt;,” which aired last year, but the series has featured &lt;a href="https://www.fandom.com/articles/awesome-simpsons-marvel"&gt;several Marvel references&lt;/a&gt; in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riqRbA"&gt;Disney has been hoarding the kind of IP that makes these crossovers possible for the better part of two decades. Under its Disney Plus service alone, we’ve seen the company throw the full force of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, Pixar, Disney, and National Geographic behind its service in order to muscle its way into the streaming fray — and it’s working, too, if those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;100 million-plus subscribers&lt;/a&gt; are any indication. But the&lt;em&gt; Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; Loki episode is a friendly reminder that Disney owns a whole lot more than just a handful of superhero and sci-fi properties. It owns pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaynJ3"&gt;Vertical integration, baby. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; is Marvel canon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 won’t launch fully until later in 2021, but you don’t need to be a developer to test the public beta right now. If you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs in order to try out the new features, we’re going to walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;These betas will update periodically leading up to the final release. Judging from years past, that release should be around the end of the summer, close to when Apple hosts its usual autumn hardware event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain bugs that won’t be squashed until the final releases roll out later in 2021. Also, it’s possible that some of the promised features won’t be in the beta initially. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Check out Allison Johnson’s in-depth breakdown of other major updates coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MhlCIp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"},{"title":"Apple’s Live Text is going to read all the text in all your photos with AI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the homescreen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. It’s not a perfect system, since iOS won’t let you have duplicate icons for apps (so you can’t have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and Google prepare to battle again after ending six-year truce</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNlsQ7V-JI8QMTP8Rt67X5lOo4U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525051/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jass1C"&gt;Microsoft and Google have reportedly ended a six-year truce on legal battles. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c4fcea11-fc92-45c8-994c-be08cb0e1055"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/google-microsoft-truce-crumbles-amid-feud-over-cloud-ad-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; are both reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft and Google formed an unusual truce in 2015, which expired in April. The pact was reportedly forged to avoid legal battles and complaints to regulators. It meant we haven’t seen Microsoft and Google complaining publicly about each other since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5135626/scroogled-microsoft-ads-attack-google"&gt;days of Scroogled&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign that attacked Google’s privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucokJa"&gt;Now the gloves appear to be off once again, and we’ve seen some evidence of that recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327306/google-microsoft-attack-open-web-online-news-australia-laws"&gt;Google slammed Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for trying to “break the way the open web works” earlier this year, after Microsoft publicly supported a law in Australia that forced Google to pay news publishers for their content. Microsoft also criticized Google’s control of the ad market, claiming publishers are forced to use Google’s tools that feed Google’s revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtPeEn"&gt;The rivalry between the two has been unusually quiet over the past five years, thanks to this legal truce. Microsoft was notably silent during the US government’s antitrust suit against Google last year, despite being the number two search engine at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8nh4744F9i_4YsJtFxiNW_bG8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679088/lcimg_9abbdc71_7b16_4ba0_b22a_2e6b359bcd82.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has had to turn to Amazon for Android apps on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="72zulP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that the agreement between Microsoft and Google was also supposed to improve cooperation between the two firms, and Microsoft was hoping to find a way to run Android apps on Windows. That obviously didn’t pan out, and Microsoft has turned to Amazon instead to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;get Android apps running on Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFBFXy"&gt;Some of the battles between Microsoft and Google were intense before this agreement, and they’re likely to get heated once again. During the height of Windows Phone in 2013, there was a particularly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/16/4627342/microsoft-google-battle-over-youtube-windows-phone"&gt;bitter battle&lt;/a&gt; between Microsoft and Google over YouTube. Months later, Microsoft was out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/20/5127052/microsoft-scroogled-mugs-t-shirts-store"&gt;selling anti-Google mugs&lt;/a&gt; and T-shirts, and acting rather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/6/5181974/why-is-microsoft-scared-of-chromebooks"&gt;nervous about Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7GZPV"&gt;A lot has changed for both Microsoft and Google since the days of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5135626/scroogled-microsoft-ads-attack-google"&gt;Scroogled&lt;/a&gt; — including new leadership on both sides — but Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327306/google-microsoft-attack-open-web-online-news-australia-laws"&gt;scathing attack on Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year proves that these tech giants are ready to battle once more.&lt;/p&gt;
