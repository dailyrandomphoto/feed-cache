    <title>There is no ‘best’ time to release new Mandalorian episodes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2OFG9yQ5xP5A7au0JRIwfWzYzI=/75x0:483x272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548489/mando_finale.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hm4zrI"&gt;For the last eight weeks, waking up on Friday morning has come with a gamble for many &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans: check Twitter to see the latest headlines &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;watch the new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; before anyone has a chance to spoil it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV4Rjt"&gt;This week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a perfect example. The second season finale includes some moments that Twitter’s trending tags and “news for you” curated topic sideline are already ruining. Without getting into spoiler territory here (and use this as a warning to stay away from Twitter if you haven’t seen the finale yet), one of the proposed solutions to this problem seems simple: release the episodes at a later time. Instead of dropping episodes at 3AM ET, why not pivot to 8 or 9PM ET, similar to how &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;used its 9PM slot on Sundays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZQUuj"&gt;It’s complicated, and it’s important to remember the desire to change the time episodes drop is largely coming from a US audience. There are a couple of key factors to remember here that didn’t impact &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;quite as much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uAjBwy"&gt;Disney Plus is a global streaming service that debuts its originals at the same time in every region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DlJGiN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a family show, enjoyed by young kids as well as adults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqGye0"&gt;Having episodes up early on Friday gives people the weekend to enjoy if they don’t care about spoilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hBW8J1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;didn’t run into many of these issues. HBO is still a primarily domestic service, with episodes airing in international territories through other carriers (like Sky in the UK) the next day. HBO can focus on its American audience because that’s where the majority of its customers are. Disney can’t. About 25 percent of Disney Plus’ overall subscriber base is &lt;a href="https://www.afaqs.com/news/media/of-868-million-disney-subscribers-30-are-from-disney-hotstar-company-is-eyeing-350-million-subs-globally-by-2024"&gt;signed up through Hotstar in India&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is rapidly rolling out the streamer to other big regions, like Latin America. While the US is still a major market, it’s not the sole area Disney has to focus on. And 9PM ET on Sunday is too late or too early for a number of other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUueo0"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;also isn’t a family show. Sure, families &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;watch it together, but it’s likely not the type of series that parents are sitting down with their seven-year-old child to watch. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together — Baby Yoda is more than just a plot device — and 9PM ET is too late. This came up in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack today when I was complaining about waking up at 6:30AM to watch the episode before starting work, which requires Twitter. 9AM ET is great for the UK crowd (5PM their time), but it’s still early, and it’s even earlier for the West Coast of the US. While it seemed like 7 or 8PM ET would be a good compromise, that means it’s 4PM PT for the West Coast crowd (a little early on Friday) and midnight for people in the UK. Better, and one that I prefer, but not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kqm3s"&gt;Then there’s the most obvious point: not everyone who is watching &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is starting their days with Twitter or Instagram or TikTok. They might not even see the spoilers — or they possibly don’t care. What a blissful life! For these &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;fans, having the episode drop early on Friday gives them Friday evening and the entire weekend to watch whenever they want. This question — “What is the best time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes?” — doesn’t apply to them, really, because they’re not bothered by spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zG5QvU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The Mandalorian’ &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together, and 9PM ET is too late&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vhqDaZ"&gt;Is there a good time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes? Depending on who you ask and where they live, the answer varies — but the reason people are asking for episodes at a certain time doesn’t. Fans want that feeling of appointment viewing back. It’s a phrase that we last used with &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad &lt;/em&gt;before it. It’s the anticipation of a new episode (&lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;certainly has that) and making sure you’re situated in front a TV or laptop or phone right when the episode begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzTRaC"&gt;By the time the episode ends, Twitter is full of jokes and gasps depending on what played out over the last few minutes. Friends who have gotten together for watch parties are bouncing. Memes start spreading. Watching a big show feels more like a communal affair than a solitary activity — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22151466/avengers-endgame-disney-2020-black-widow-infinity-war-pandemic-streaming-theaters"&gt;we really needed this year&lt;/a&gt;. People want &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;earlier or later because they &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to experience it with the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOt21n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is the biggest TV event of the year. It’s the thing that rolls around every Friday and we bemoan our friends to hurry up and finish watching because we want to talk about it. People are waking up at different times, they’re busy with kids in the morning, or have any number of other priorities that mean they can’t sit down and watch &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;at 6 or 7 in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfLhnw"&gt;It’s nearly impossible to find a perfect time that works for everyone, so releasing episodes at midnight PT &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;make the most sense, especially in a streaming-dominant world where preference and choice define the watching experience. It just sucks that an event-type show as big as &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;can’t really ever create the same beautiful, appointment TV, communal viewing experience that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;provided. I predict it’s an issue we’ll see grow as the major streamers expand globally. Think &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, but again and again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1Am_c5giPcg6onGRkpdlHj42xM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548275/VRG_ILLO_4348_BikeBoom.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Og6Kxu"&gt;This year, millions of people turned to bicycles as a safe and socially distanced way to get out of their homes, shake off that cabin fever, and get some fresh air, and suddenly — thanks to COVID — bikes were &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;. But unless concerted efforts are made to ensure people can continue to cycle safely and in great numbers, all those bikes may soon be gathering dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqrAXv"&gt;Things looked grim at first, with bike sales plummeting as cities went into lockdown. But as the year plodded along, bike sales started really getting up to speed. Popular bikes went on backorder. Local shops and big-box retailers struggled to keep up with demand. The humble bicycle emerged as one of the rare winners of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MBJDR"&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes. Driving rates dropped around the world as people sheltered in place. Cities closed down streets to cars to encourage walking and biking, or repurposed parking spaces for outdoor dining. Some cities, like Paris, Brussels, Seattle, and Oakland, announced plans to make these spaces permanently car-free, in the hopes of encouraging more sustainable transportation to fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y0yuPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6UlMX"&gt;But the cars are coming back because the cars always come back. Vehicle miles traveled in the US were only down 9 percent in September compared to last year, after dropping nearly 40 percent in April during the height of the first wave. The cycling community is worried about the sustainability of this latest boom. “This could be a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster our ranks by sharing the joy of cycling,” &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a32781813/keep-new-riders/"&gt;Eben Weiss wrote in &lt;em&gt;Bicycling &lt;/em&gt;magazine in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The last thing we need is to send these new riders back to their SUVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxsnHw"&gt;The need for the bike boom to roll on beyond the pandemic is about more than the love of cycling, though. You’ll literally breathe easier when you start replacing more car trips with bicycles. We’re talking less carbon emissions, less traffic congestion, and a healthier population — the essential ingredients that make people happier and less stressed out. In the &lt;a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20.pdf"&gt;World Happiness Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;, countries with &lt;a href="https://ecf.com/resources/cycling-facts-and-figures"&gt;high bicycle use&lt;/a&gt; tend to be among the happiest overall, like the Netherlands (ranked sixth; daily bike use: 43 percent), Denmark (ranked second; daily bike use: 30 percent), and Finland (ranked first; daily bike use: 28 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnDSo7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bike boom, by the numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0t01z"&gt;A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62 percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144 percent increase year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7alosh"&gt;It’s not just in the US, of course. Europeans are projected to buy an extra 10 million bikes per year by 2020, a whopping 47 percent more than the annual number in 2019. And China, where most of the world’s bikes are manufactured, exported over 40 million bikes in the first nine months of 2020, a number four times the EU’s annual bike production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28dqiS"&gt;Major bike manufacturers saw a huge windfall, with companies like Giant and Dorel (parent of Cannondale, Schwinn, Mongoose, and Pacific) reporting substantial revenue increases throughout the year. And popular e-bike brands like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, Gocycle, and many others all say they are doing record sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiBk4u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haters gonna hate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJcd9I"&gt;Wall Street is betting that the bike boom will eventually fizzle because they’re ghouls who don’t believe we can have nice things. (Kidding, kidding — please don’t tank my retirement account.) Actually, they assume that Americans will eventually ditch their new two-wheeled friends once a vaccine is widely available — which is a pretty low opinion of our level of commitment, so it’s probably accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBCKBR"&gt;Bike stocks plunged last month on the news that Pfizer had developed an effective coronavirus vaccine, &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/11/13/wall-street-thinks-the-bike-boom-is-over-and-thats-the-problem/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Giant fell 9 percent, Dorel Sports fell 7.6 percent, and bike parts maker Shimano fell 13.1 percent in one day. A month later, those stocks are still trading lower than at their summer peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5tdVUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvyNVL"&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past. The invention of the “safety bicycle” with its chain-driven transmission in the 1890s led to one of the biggest bike crazes of all, but it couldn’t survive the advent of the automobile. Another boom in the 1970s, spurred both by the introduction of 10-speed derailleur racing bikes and the oil crisis, faded after gas prices became more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH4SB5"&gt;Bikes may once again be flying off the shelf, but &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-biking-driving-commute-aa3b4059-958f-4f82-b84f-b0f6d486468c.html"&gt;Americans are actually biking less than in previous years&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely due to the steep drop in overall commuting rates as more workers chose to work from home. It would seem that recreational biking isn’t enough to offset the difference. But we’re also driving a lot less, too. It remains to be seen how it will shake out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoPX3u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to sustain the boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL9Yc9"&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope to keep people riding bicycles may rest with the federal government. The upside is the fixes may be as simple as providing money to cities for protected bike lanes, as well as approving financial incentives like tax credits for new bike and e-bike purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4opw4"&gt;The best way the government can encourage more cycling is to reform automobile regulations, which is likely a heavier lift. Currently, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assigns safety ratings to new cars and trucks through its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). But this rating is based solely on risks posed to automobile occupants — and not the danger posed to vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8z6J9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope may rest with the federal government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2LKF"&gt;The number of cycling fatalities grew &lt;a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/historical-fatality-trends/deaths-by-type-of-incident/"&gt;38 percent from 2008 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the US recorded the highest number of pedestrian deaths in 30 years. This is related to the increase in big SUV and truck sales. The number of pedestrians killed by drivers of oversized vehicles has skyrocketed by 81 percent in the last decade, according to a report released last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1Ly3"&gt;The European Union’s version of the NCAP is different and obviously better. Vehicles receive a five-star review only if they can demonstrate an ability to come to a complete halt — or at least slow down — before colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. Under President Obama, NHTSA began the process of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/12/16/2015-31323/new-car-assessment-program"&gt;revising NCAP to address safety of those outside the vehicle&lt;/a&gt;; under President Trump, that effort was abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0vgim"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden could easily revive these efforts. And given Biden’s affinity for two-wheeled transportation — the incoming president spent a recent Saturday on what looked to be a &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a34728527/joe-jill-biden-delaware-bike-ride/"&gt;delightful bike jaunt around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware&lt;/a&gt; — there is hope that he will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaqcSL"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it will be a fight. Or more accurately, it will be a turf war, as bikes will need to take physical space away from cars to maintain any forward momentum. But there are a lot of positive signs that bikes can gain the upper hand. Bike-share systems are setting records for ridership, and the popularity of electric scooters are helping to send the message to cities that a commitment to protecting the environment starts with protecting those who choose two wheels over four. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJgW5h"&gt;The push to protect cyclists and encourage more biking began long before COVID; let’s keep the fight going after the pandemic is over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Two new Google antirust cases and an AirPods Max review </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xXH0EyRgeu85YDcw4g1bvVtJx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548235/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time is running out to snag these deals before the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PhGMFVJ1TXjHlYYFe8JwAYBbt4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548233/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_Layout_SCRN_11_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch offers some much-needed joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpkgON"&gt;The holidays are upon us, and we’re just about to enter crunch time for gift-getting. If you haven’t made your selections, it’s possible that gifts might not get where they need to go on time — unless you pay for rush shipping or you take advantage of curbside pickup services. I know that’s a lot of pressure, but if you’re ready to make a few purchases for tech fans in your life, we have a few last-minute suggestions that also happen to be good deals. Depending on the retailer, these might not arrive in time for the holidays, but it’s the thought that counts, right? You’ve got this!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb-rYrx0aIIqbpRvhnYsRL7skeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19927387/DSCF5984_1_2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lMg7Sf"&gt;Google’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds rarely see a discount, but they’re $35 off at online store Antonline. Normally $179, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/google/pixel_buds"&gt;they’re $144&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;antfarm&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This deal is available until December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yO3sUFwh9SHcxCjhbb_m1O4BWY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699852/IMG_0626-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRSHkA"&gt;Sony’s ever-popular WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones are $278 at several retailers, which is the same $72 discount we’ve seen pop up a few times this season. Normally $349, they’re a solid option if you want high-end sound and effective noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kcIwS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1lhEhV"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are still selling for a great price at Woot. $190 is the best price heading into the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGiBjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LiwFZ5"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show series of smart displays just got Zoom support, so you can easily boot up a video call with family over the holidays. The most affordable model is the Echo Show 5, which is just $45 at a few retailers. If you want a bigger display and better sound performance, check out the Echo Show 8 for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g4uAJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yjmxPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLClPI"&gt;Giving your home Wi-Fi signal a boost is never a bad idea. If you or a loved one has a one-router setup that just isn’t cutting it with the work-from-home lifestyle that the pandemic has forced us into, check out this deal on a three-pack of Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers. Normally $279, you can get them for $223 at Best Buy and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kyOOYe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScwMZ2"&gt;If you’re new to the Nintendo Switch and are in need of some games, a few of the best are discounted, including &lt;em&gt;Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield, Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2VlfjW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="DEjyKW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QdeD6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="turCoo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zreOKq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s holiday event brings back airplanes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBxLaG9xeb1R9Ge9xyFFuwQ2rKw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548224/fortnite_snowmando_quest_frost_squad_and_snowmando_outfits_1920x1080_2177b76f5c5c.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LYRfLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s annual holiday event is back, and this time, it brings a surprise: the return of airplanes. “&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/operation-snowdown-starts-now-in-fortnite-unlock-free-outfits-take-flight-and-more"&gt;Operation Snowdown&lt;/a&gt;,” as it’s called, lasts from December 18th to January 5th, and it adds the expected to the game, including a snowy map and free unlockables like a soldier snowman called Snowmando. Everyone who logs in before January 5th will also get a free caroling emote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sO2KGL"&gt;The biggest feature, though, is the return of airplanes. The timing is perfect: planes were first introduced in season 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128743/fortnite-season-7-trailer-details-battle-pass"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was also a winter-themed update for the game. (There was even a militarized Santa character.) They were later removed, and it sounds like their latest appearance will be short-lived as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIgCMh"&gt;In addition to the new missions and free unlockable cosmetics, the event will also include a rotating selection of limited time game modes, starting with the return of Air Royale. There will also be new holiday-themed items for purchase, including a shifty-looking candy cane man.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybhlMgrKADaDljfpV46DSA5QIpw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182372/fortnite_holiday_outfits_1920x1080_1f6b8460b369.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NBzyDm"&gt;It’s been a busy month for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a massive supervillain-themed live event&lt;/a&gt;, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;kicked off its latest season on December 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, introducing new characters like the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt; have joined the battle royale game, and Epic has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176382/fortnite-epic-120-fps-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;continued to improve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge guide to The Mandalorian</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1SbcAl"&gt;For a show about a tiny alien, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; sure had a huge impact. The first season of the series helped sell millions on Disney Plus, the company’s Netflix-style streaming service, while simultaneously showing how the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe could translate to prestige television. It was, to put it succinctly, a hit — one that became even more popular thanks to the adorable Baby Yoda. Er, I mean, &lt;em&gt;The Child&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwG2Cb"&gt;The second season, meanwhile, faces a very different challenge. Not only does it have to live up to the hype generated by season 1, but it’s also releasing at a time when many of the biggest movies and TV shows have been indefinitely delayed due to the ongoing pandemic, making it arguably the biggest entertainment release of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9llms4"&gt;To help you keep track of everything related to the show — reviews of the latest episodes, analyses on what its success means for Disney’s business, and yes, cute pictures of Baby Yoda — we’ve created this landing page to gather up all of the biggest &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; stories in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5C5C7"&gt;If you need to stay up to date — this is the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian collides with the broader Star Wars universe in its season 2 finale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iwapxodp2S5oKhVthHa2hMdRMQw=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548017/HUC2_FF_002658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZjGd5"&gt;As expected,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; finale culminated in a dramatic showdown between Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) — aka, Mando — and Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) over the fate of Grogu (née Baby Yoda). But “The Rescue” didn’t just run into the expected complications for an assault on a massive Imperial cruiser: it also ran into the mainstream &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;universe in the biggest way yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSi3rP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Spoilers for the entirety of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 2 and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Wars: The Last Jedi &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FoJsH"&gt;Par for the course for Mando, though, things didn’t go quite as planned. While the armored hero did succeed in saving his adopted son, it came at a bittersweet cost: Grogu’s earlier callout for any other Jedi was answered by none other than Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, reprising the iconic role through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/27/14090152/rogue-one-animators-star-wars-grand-moff-tarkin-peter-cushing-cgi"&gt;not entirely convincing&lt;/a&gt; CGI de-aging effect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0U9Xh"&gt;The result? The Child is saved, but Luke is taking him away to continue his training in the ways of the Force. After avoiding the larger &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe for two seasons, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; has found itself right in the path of the Skywalker Saga. It’s a move that has big ramifications, for both Mando and the show that bears his name.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hYa6pUTQoGYX0LjSSKGh9Rr9MH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182173/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_8.36.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RqgJmf"&gt;After all, Grogu has been practically synonymous with &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; for the last two years. He’s been the guiding star that Mando has followed, the catalyst for his transformation from a cold bounty hunter who just follows the money to his next job into a loving, caring father figure. Even at the end, Mando finds it hard to let go. “He doesn’t want to go with you!” he tells Luke, before almost tearfully taking off his helmet to say goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiJWkG"&gt;Where things go next is unclear. The Luke who we meet here is a very different person from the young Jedi who fought with Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star a few years earlier or the grizzled, jaded hermit living in self-imposed exile after his failure to train Ben Solo / Kylo Ren. (Interestingly enough, Ben is about four years old at the time of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;— meaning Grogu might be getting a new toddler friend who is also strong with the Force.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LWYP5"&gt;This is Luke at his prime, back when he still believed in the idea of training a new generation of Jedi. The sequence that sees Luke calmly dismantle a platoon of Dark Troopers (itself almost an inverse of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14040916/darth-vader-rogue-one-final-lightsaber-scene-star-wars"&gt;chilling Vader hallway scene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a demonstration of the height of Luke’s power here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIlcfW"&gt;Of course — and, rather concerning where Grogu is concerned — we know that Luke’s efforts are doomed to failure. In just a few short years (a blink of an eye for Grogu, given the comparatively slow aging of his and Yoda’s race), Ben Solo will turn on his master, slaughter the Jedi trainees at Luke’s temple, and be reborn as Kylo Ren at the forefront of the First Order. Hopefully, Grogu won’t be among them when he does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B33OSmDVIXt6G_qpZBpKRZsi1Rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182193/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_9.54.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pAy4ca"&gt;But that’s all relatively far in the future. For now, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season leaves bigger questions unanswered. Where does Mando go next without his son? Does Din backslide into bounty hunting, scraping out a living now that he no longer has someone to take care of or a grand quest to pursue? Will he be dragged into the contentious world of Mandalorian politics as the current wielder of the Darksaber? And is the show really going to put Grogu — its most popular, most iconic character — on the sidelines? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rustgz"&gt;“I’ll see you again. I promise,” Mando tells Grogu before giving him over to Luke. And with &lt;a href="https://tvline.com/2020/12/10/the-mandalorian-renewed-season-3-premiere-date-disney-plus/#:~:text=The%20Mandalorian%20Season%203%20Will%20Bow%20Christmas%202021%2C%20Disney%2B%20Confirms&amp;amp;text=Christmas%202021%20has%20come%20early,Walt%20Disney's%20Investor%20Day%20presentation."&gt;more seasons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;spinoffs&lt;/a&gt; looking to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168619/disney-plus-star-wars-rangers-of-the-new-republic-ahsoka-mandalorian-spinoffs"&gt;build out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s corner of the galaxy in the coming years, it seems likely that this won’t be the last we see of the adorable green child. After all, if there’s one thing that we’ve learned about Mando in the last two seasons, he always keeps his word. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government adds DJI to Commerce blacklist over ties to Chinese government</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9qdgB"&gt;DJI — one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199842/bloomberg-businessweek-dji-drone-market-share-china-government-security"&gt;largest and most popular drone companies in the world&lt;/a&gt; — has been added to the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List, designating the Chinese company as a national security concern and banning US-based companies from exporting technology to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmUYKT"&gt;DroneDJ &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, which was &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-adding-chinese-drone-company-dji-to-economic-blacklist-official-2020-12"&gt;confirmed by Reuters&lt;/a&gt; based on a conference call with a senior commerce official. The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for further details. DJI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yl8G3Q"&gt;The ban was put in place through the same mechanism as the US government’s ongoing ban on Huawei products, and is primarily focused on blocking the export of US technology to the drone-maker. As such, the ban will make it difficult for US businesses to provide parts or components for DJI to use in its drones, which is likely to disrupt the company’s supply chain. It may also make it difficult for US stores to directly sell DJI products or transact with the company, particularly if China responds to the action with further restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kYfGd"&gt;The ban is set to go into effect when the list is officially updated at 11:15AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NQEvgh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“for actions deemed contrary to the national security”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKOrKn"&gt;The new additions to the entity list came alongside a more specific action &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/12/commerce-adds-chinas-smic-entity-list-restricting-access-key-enabling"&gt;against China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, or SMIC, which was listed in response to purported ties between the company and the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGieXd"&gt;Less explanation was given for DJI’s addition to the list, although Commerce said other companies were added “for actions deemed contrary to the national security or foreign policy interest of the United States.” This is &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/"&gt;likely a reference&lt;/a&gt; to DJI’s involvement in providing drones to the Chinese government to surveill detention camps in the Xinjiang provice, &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F2020-03-26%2Fdji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price%3Fsrnd%3Deconomics-vp%26sref%3DExbtjcSG&amp;amp;a=1722098870466579501&amp;amp;uuid=0129be77-04d4-4fff-93e3-0a2eea64f11f&amp;amp;uid_bam=1720778310608519800&amp;amp;ar=1726904878611144427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as detailed in a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Businessweek&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0CFJW"&gt;But the United States government has also cited several concerns in the past over security issues with the drones, which are largely made in China and contain Chinese parts. The Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to ground its drone fleet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940921/us-interior-department-drone-grounding-china-spying-cybersecurity-risk"&gt;as it reviews&lt;/a&gt; whether there are any major security concerns of Chinese spying or cyberattacks. And the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/media/document/ojporderfundingdrones.pdf"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; buying foreign-made drones — which includes DJI’s products — using agency funds back in October, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/520269-justice-department-issues-policy-banning-use-of-grant-funds-for-certain"&gt;citing similar security concerns&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Defense has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;certified several other drones&lt;/a&gt; from competitors like Parrot and Skydio for governmental use instead, after several years of review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nryl2v"&gt;It’s a significant escalation in President Trump’s ongoing efforts to block Chinese tech companies from operating in the United States. Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;placed Huawei on the entity list by executive order&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, citing national security concerns. Europe and the UK have largely declined to follow suit and continue to use Huawei hardware in their telecommunications networks. Trump took similar measures to block TikTok and WeChat from being hosted in US app stores, although the efforts were held up by court challenges and both apps remain widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzZmjH"&gt;It is unclear whether President-elect Biden will continue these policies after taking office on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3yEtg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple explains how the AirPods Max conserve battery life — with or without the case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mbEe7tg3aOiglzwJ2U5i7-NDI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547607/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckRZ6B"&gt;After some initial confusion around how the AirPods Max handle power management, Apple has tried to clarify the issue with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886"&gt;an updated support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining how and when its new $550 headphones automatically conserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyxn56"&gt;Originally, the company said that “when stored in their soft, slim smart case, AirPods Max enter an ultra‑low‑power state that preserves charge.” But there was uncertainty about what happens when they’re left &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the headphones lost only a few battery percentage points when left out overnight with no case — nothing close to a worrying level of drain. But not everyone had that experience; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvvo6vUpJRc"&gt;Marques Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; observed a greater amount of battery loss when the AirPods Max were idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgLlfQ"&gt;According to Apple, the AirPods Max enter a “low power mode” when removed from your head and left stationary for five minutes outside of the case. If they’re left in that state for 72 hours, they go into a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; power mode that switches off Bluetooth and features like Apple’s Find My location tracking. This, essentially, sounds like when they actually turn “off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgvvoN"&gt;But somewhat surprisingly, the smart case doesn’t immediately trigger this deeper sleep mode as quickly as I would’ve thought. Inserting the AirPods Max into the case puts them into that lighter low power mode right away. But it takes 18 hours of the headphones being in the smart case for them to enter the ultra-low power mode. When the case is factored in, Apple never mentions that the headphones have to be “stationary” to enter these modes. But the fact that it takes almost an entire 24 hours for the AirPods Max to hit that point where they maximize battery — even in the case — is a bit surprising to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnVW3m"&gt;Clearly, the company is prioritizing quick device reconnections and convenience over eking every last bit of battery out of the AirPods Max. One big question is what happens if the headphones are left worn around your neck when removed; since they’re not stationary in that scenario, my guess is that they remain fully active until taken off and put on a table or stand. It’s possible that Apple could adjust these default behaviors through firmware updates, but for now, this is how the AirPods Max work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Qv0J"&gt;Even if I’ve seen minimal battery drain, and just as I say in our video review, I still wish they had a power button. For simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA will fly Orion deep-space crew capsule ‘as is,’ despite failed component</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dor0bnohP2ZyUY0vlxq9lw03dBs=/0x0:5040x3360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547603/KSC_20201028_PH_JBS01_0137_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z0TMsK"&gt;NASA is opting to fly its future deep-space crew capsule Orion “as is” next year, after the agency discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726753/nasa-orion-crew-capsule-power-unit-failure-artemis-i"&gt;one of the spacecraft’s power instruments had suffered a failure&lt;/a&gt;. Engineers had been mulling over whether to replace the instrument before the vehicle’s flight but ultimately decided that there was enough redundancy in the system to withstand the failed component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDvPKa"&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system, which has been through thousands of hours of powered operations and testing,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/12/17/artemis-i-orion-progress-update/"&gt;the agency wrote in a blog post announcing the decision&lt;/a&gt;. “Engineers will perform additional testing and continue to monitor the health of the spacecraft while Orion is powered on to provide continued confidence in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jOhTvM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRTH1v"&gt;In November, engineers at NASA and Lockheed Martin, Orion’s primary contractor, found that part of an instrument known as a power and data unit, or PDU, had failed. One of eight PDUs on Orion, the instrument is needed for activating various functions while the capsule is in flight. It’s also in a fairly hard-to-reach place. This PDU is located in the adapter that connects the Orion capsule with its service module, a cylindrical trunk that supports the vehicle during flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4jedO"&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix. Engineers were looking at options that would have taken four to 12 months to complete. The fixes would have involved either taking apart the vehicle or tunneling through the outer walls to reach the PDU, and the extra time could have potentially caused a delay for Orion’s target launch date in November 2021. Instead, NASA has chosen not to replace the PDU. The instrument can still function; it just lost one of its power channels used for redundancy. That means this PDU will fly without a backup system in case its primary channel fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ie9Hil"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4rVy4"&gt;NASA claims that fixing the PDU presented more risk than flying &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the PDU. “[Engineers] determined that due to the limited accessibility to this particular box, the degree of intrusiveness to the overall spacecraft systems, and other factors, the risk of collateral damage outweighed the risk associated with the loss of one leg of redundancy in a highly redundant system,” the agency wrote in its blog post. “Therefore, NASA has made the decision to proceed with vehicle processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3j4F"&gt;No people will be on board this Orion spacecraft when it flies. The vehicle is slated to fly uncrewed on top of NASA’s future massive rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. That rocket is also undergoing testing ahead of that flight, and it’s unclear if it will be ready by November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
