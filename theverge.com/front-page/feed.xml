    <title>Amazon’s new CEO says it’s not done making video games, despite problems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VpZKxCXHnWSfbBrex_Q-Uf09VCQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767228/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lNyzLd"&gt;Amazon’s incoming CEO, Andy Jassy, says he’s committed to Amazon’s video game development efforts, in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week about the problems facing the team. “Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy wrote in a staff email &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS [Amazon Game Studios], I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQoXul"&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter,” Jassy continued. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaoMsI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpYBO"&gt;The message comes at a critical time for Amazon Game Studios, the e-commerce giant’s video game development arm. The decision to set up the division reportedly came directly from outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who recently announced he is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down from the position later this year&lt;/a&gt; to be replaced by current Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy. With the company reportedly spending almost $500 million a year on its as-yet unsuccessful video game division, it’s important that it has the support of the incoming CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fgh2ND"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous report alleged that Amazon Game Studios has faced a host of problems including a studio head who lacks experience in video games, a “painfully slow” in-house game engine, and a “bro culture” that doesn’t give women the same opportunities as men. In response to the report, studio head Mike Frazzini has reportedly emailed the team, saying that there’s “zero tolerance” for “anything less than a fully equitable and inclusive environment.” In his email this week, Jassy expressed support for Frazzini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSQujC"&gt;Despite Jassy’s support, Amazon Game Studios is still facing challenges. Last year it released, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;pulled and cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;, a hero shooter that drew inspiration from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. Another of its tentpole games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World,&lt;/em&gt; was also delayed&lt;/a&gt;, while a video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; was released to such poor reviews in 2019 that it was later &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt;removed from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. AGS might have the support of Amazon’s next CEO, but it’s got a long way to go if it wants to earn the support of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9iGoD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPJjtA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen wants its new Beosound Level to outlast your average connected speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2UmWk02WaWaQ-89lSjQS0waIcmw=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767124/CS_Level__wood__5.tif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level is available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pd7iNU"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s Beosound Level is the Danish brand’s latest battery-powered connected speaker. It supports voice controls via Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and you can also stream to it via the AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Spotify Connect standards. B&amp;amp;O says the Beosound Level uses a modular construction that it claims will make it usable far into the future. It’s a welcome feature, considering the speaker’s high $1,499 (£1,099) starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPdH9g"&gt;While many stereos and amplifiers from the middle of the last century can still be used today, the average lifespan of modern integrated audio systems is far shorter. If your music system contains a computer, then it’s inevitable that it’ll eventually become outdated. B&amp;amp;O’s hope is that the modular design it’s using for the Beosound Level will help the company keep it supported for longer, as well as making it easier to repair when components fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9NQ4JyqbVwWT8bWUztyLLCT1es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278651/CS_Level__fabric__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level can be wall mounted...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j8gJmwmZVFV6VQU8juXJL8YFC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278652/CS_Level__wood__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...or used as a freestanding speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmd68"&gt;Central to this modularity is the Beosound Level’s streaming module, which houses the speaker’s digital signal processing (DSP) chip, wireless connectivity tech, and antenna array. It’s B&amp;amp;O’s first speaker to use it, but the company says it won’t be the last; it’ll be standardized across its future lineup of home speakers. B&amp;amp;O says there’s enough processing headroom in the hardware that ships with the Beosound Level that it should be able to handle updates in the immediate future. But when the hardware reaches its limit, the company plans to offer an upgrade service for users who are prepared to send their device in to the company to have the streaming module replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFPNXQ"&gt;The Beosound Level’s battery is also modular, and unlike the streaming module, it’s user-replaceable. However, its form factor won’t be standardized across B&amp;amp;O’s speaker lineup, so replacing it will require a battery made specifically for the Beosound Level. Battery life is rated at up to 16 hours with volumes at moderate levels, dropping to four hours at max volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aUz6zQbX6ew7-7-1Z4uyJ9cmQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278655/CS_Level__wood__4.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A magnetically attaching disc can be used to charge the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xL3roo0AwpHZtJ02PwzutPz_u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278845/BangOlufsen_BeoSoundLevel_MeroxCMA_Warm_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level’s modular components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LI9Qhi"&gt;Other features include a built-in accelerometer that allows the Beosound Level to adjust its sound depending on whether it’s standing vertically, horizontally, or hanging on a wall. (A wall bracket is available separately for $119, or £89.) Internally, the speaker has five drivers: two 4-inch woofers, one 2-inch full-range driver, and two 0.8-inch tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8D90"&gt;Charging is either handled via a USB-C port on the speaker itself or by attaching a small magnetic plug (which is powered over USB). The speaker has an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, touch controls, and it’s available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z6XQv"&gt;We’ve seen companies try to take modular approaches with their devices before, but success has been elusive so far. Modular smartphones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; gotten off the ground, and Alienware’s promises about a modular future-proof laptop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;fell apart after just one year&lt;/a&gt;. Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen tells me it hopes to support the Beosound Level for years after it eventually stops producing the speaker, so it might be some time before we see if it’s able to deliver on its goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDgIa3"&gt;The Beosound Level is available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If Twitter’s dark mode has recently changed for you, you’re not alone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/md38uSlRwmgL0w4XB5xw0uWS4xo=/0x93:1376x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766315/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_3.53.27_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not the familiar dark blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UeeSN"&gt;The feeling of opening Twitter and noticing that something’s &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; probably isn’t a new one, but it usually isn’t related to the site’s color scheme. Yet some users (and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff) are now seeing that Twitter’s desktop dark mode has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johncoryk/status/1357003602842292225"&gt;gotten darker&lt;/a&gt;, or worse, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GarbageApe/status/1357074376953323521"&gt;been changed to light mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe92UL"&gt;Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the change from blue to black was intentional — it’s part of an update to make the Twitter website respond to the light and dark modes on your OS. Of course, if you miss the dark blue, you can bring it back by going to Twitter’s display settings and choosing Dim mode (instead of the inky black Lights Out or the bright Default), and the site should remember that preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nye0M"&gt;If your Twitter switched from dark mode to light, though, the company says that wasn’t supposed to happen. That was caused by a bug, and could’ve happened to you if you had Twitter set to Dim or Lights Out mode but had your OS in light mode. Head to your display settings to change that back, if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of Twitter’s accent and background color settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-LvZe-3xmBSYfj5R4pGqTPsMMlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280097/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_5.09.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter should remember your color and background settings after you choose one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xpVeYb"&gt;While you’re there, you can also choose an accent color, if you’re tired of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Alexa can now help find a COVID test or ruin your morning with Minions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ig-JGJFUKULDO-b4P6X_qcvrLBs=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766104/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EzzUls"&gt;Amazon added a few abilities to Alexa last month, introducing a variety of Super Bowl-related skills and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249044/amazon-alexa-update-proactive-hunches-guard-plus-subscription"&gt;the ability to do home automation on its own&lt;/a&gt;, but today the company’s telling us about some new alarm and COVID skills that snuck under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0GnI"&gt;You’ve been able to set custom alarms and alarm sounds using Alexa devices for a while now, but now you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBCUniversal-Media-LLC-Minions-Alarm/dp/B08R978HDV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=minion&amp;amp;qid=1612394275&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;do it with Minion sounds&lt;/a&gt;, if you just haven’t been waking up angry enough. The sounds include such classics as “Peep Peep Peep”, “Banana,” or “Boing Boing Boing!” Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rp4Rg5"&gt;There are now a variety of branded alarms available for Alexa, including sounds from Disney, Spongebob, Jurassic World, and Harry Potter. They can be set by saying “Alexa, wake me up to Minions/Jurassic World/Spongebob/etc alarm tone.” Some of the alarm tones are free, some can be expanded with in-skill purchases, and some cost money, starting at $1.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCmtbg"&gt;The alarm sounds can be added by asking your Alexa device for them, and you can also browse and add them in the Android version of the Alexa app. If you’re using the iOS version of the app, you’ll just have to read the list and ask your smart speaker to install them. It seems Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;was able to work out a deal with Apple to get Prime video rentals working&lt;/a&gt;, but not Alexa skill payment processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lICnS2"&gt;Turning to skills that could be slightly more useful, Alexa can now help you find the nearest COVID testing site, or help you find vaccine trials. Asking Alexa “where can I get tested for COVID” will make it read out a list of the nearby places you can get tested at. You can then have Alexa call one of the locations if you want more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QscwZE"&gt;If you’re looking for vaccine trials, you can also ask “Alexa find a COVID trial”, and it’ll look for any within 30 miles of you, using research organization IQVIA to search for trials. Of course, this is information that you could find on the internet yourself, but it might be a convenient option if you don’t mind Amazon knowing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t buy Teslas during a production ramp, Elon Musk says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4psoip0hoqOweF9LfHc97V-k0I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68766096/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkcit7"&gt;The quality of Tesla’s cars suffers any time the company dramatically scales up production, CEO Elon Musk admitted in a February 2nd interview. Musk also said that Tesla was making cars so fast near the end of 2020 that it was messing up the paint jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xenZiH"&gt;Tesla has gotten a lot of criticism for the quality of its cars, especially after it started making them at relatively high volumes with the Model 3 and Model Y. But in the interview with industry analyst Sandy Munro, Musk was unusually candid about quality control problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBnWih"&gt;“It took us a while to kind of iron out the production process. Friends ask me: ‘When should I buy a Tesla?’ And I’m like: ‘Well, either buy it right at the beginning, or when the production reaches a steady state,’” Musk said in the interview. “But during that production ramp, it’s super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the little details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xHCbJG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAtLTLiqNwg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQJKVX"&gt;Munro then asked why his brand new Model 3 sedan had paint issues, when another one built a month later that he saw was “spectacular.” Musk replied that Tesla had improved its paint quality “toward the end of last year, even in the course of December.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thYxfT"&gt;While the Model 3 is now more than three years old, Tesla spent much of 2020 trying to hit an ambitious target set by Musk of selling 500,000 vehicles. That push apparently led to more quality problems with the paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tPGfo"&gt;“One of the things that was happening when we were ramping production was the paint wasn’t necessarily drying enough,” Musk said. “So, it’s like, if you go faster... it’s like, you just discover these things. Like, If we knew them in advance, we would fix them in advance,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf3BeD"&gt;Munro is well known for tearing down cars of all types, but his critiques of Tesla’s vehicles are especially popular. His examination of a Model 3 in 2018 was particularly tough, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-model-3-teardown-by-engineering-firm-reveals-qual-1822678045"&gt;comparing the quality to a Kia from the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. “I cant imagine how they released this,” Munro said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxwZVK"&gt;“I thought your criticisms were accurate,” Musk said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lKrKx"&gt;It’s one of the more illuminating interviews Musk has granted in a long while. He and Munro also &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-epically-nerdy-interview-elon-musk-discusses-build-1846181756"&gt;went deep&lt;/a&gt; on a number of other Tesla topics, like the company’s custom seats, how it’s trying to avoid similar quality problems with the Model Y SUV, Autopilot, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler’s CEO has been fired</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxuKfD"&gt;After his social media platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;was largely wiped off the web&lt;/a&gt;, Parler CEO and co-founder John Matze says he has been fired by his company’s own board of directors, according to &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-hes-been-terminated-by-board-i-did-not-participate-in-this-decision"&gt;a memo obtained by Fox News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parler-ceo-says-he-was-fired-by-conservative-political-donor-rebekah-mercer-11612397380"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a text message confirmation &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2K95IO"&gt;he sent to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His LinkedIn page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22265298%2Fparlers-ceo-has-been-fired#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; an employment end date of January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2As8L"&gt;Parler, of course, is the social network that found itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;wholly deplatformed&lt;/a&gt; after its role in the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the app from their app stores after being unsatisfied with the company’s attempts to moderate the spread of calls for violence. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon decided&lt;/a&gt; to terminate the company’s AWS website hosting completely. And though Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;did try to sue Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22231457/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-judge-preliminary-injunction-denied"&gt;denied a demand&lt;/a&gt; for its website hosting to be reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIwp1a"&gt;On January 10th, Matze told Fox News that all the company’s vendors — and even its lawyers — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;had abandoned him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZyYgKS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are the violent threats that made Amazon drop Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"},{"title":"Why platforms had to cut off Trump and Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EUsa7Z"&gt;Today, Matze claims he was terminated by a board led by Rebekah Mercer (of the Mercer family, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;who are prominent conservative donors&lt;/a&gt;), and suggested he was fired due to his “strong belief in free speech” and his product vision, including “what I believe is a more effective approach to content moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp0M7X"&gt;It might also have something to do with the company getting run into the ground under his watch. In addition to the difficulties of simply staying up on the internet, it came to light that Parler may have had some privacy issues. Researchers were able to scrape a tremendous amount of users’ content, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;including their geotagged locations and videos&lt;/a&gt;, which were later converted into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;interactive maps of the Capitol building attack&lt;/a&gt; that proved many Parler users were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZPwVp"&gt;The House Oversight Committee even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called for an FBI investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Parler’s involvement in the attack on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyCPib"&gt;Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;does currently have a website again&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the hosting services of Epik, a company that also supports controversial websites like Gab and 8chan, and Parler suggested on January 17th that it hoped “to welcome all of you back soon.” But that was over two weeks ago, and the website is mostly a timeline of grievances about how the company has been treated unjustly. Matze hasn’t posted there since Monday, January 26th. His last post was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;a Bernie Sanders meme&lt;/a&gt; with the text “I wish that John guy would hurry up already.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGyybz_Qxr8KZP9LAd0sFAq5IFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279936/matze_last_post_parler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iub5X2"&gt;Apparently, Rebekah Mercer agreed with that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUACSk"&gt;Parler didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon plans to install always-on surveillance cameras in its delivery vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Amazon Prime delivery van is seen in London..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcfLhnq9JOAjelSzFpIBLfAFLUY=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765487/1229783847.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhKWYf"&gt;Amazon plans to install high-tech video cameras in its delivery vehicles in order to better monitor the behavior of drivers as they deliver packages, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-plans-ai-powered-cameras-to-monitor-delivery-van-drivers"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMq0Fc"&gt;The hardware and software will be supplied by Netradyne, a California company behind a platform called &lt;a href="https://www.netradyne.com/driveri/"&gt;Driveri&lt;/a&gt; that uses cameras and artificial intelligence to analyze a driver as they operate the vehicle. The camera then gives real-time feedback — including automated suggestions like “distracted driving” and “please slow down” — while collecting analysis that is used to later evaluate drivers during their shifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8MICg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Netradyne cameras record 100 percent of the time and automatically upload footage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhOww8"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F504570835%2Fe80ee265bc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22265031%2Famazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unlisted, week-old video hosted on the website Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; details the partnership. It’s narrated by Karolina Haraldsdottir, Amazon’s senior manager for last-mile safety, and outlines the company’s goals as reducing collisions and holding drivers more accountable for mistakes on the road. The initiative mirrors one Amazon has taken with its long-haul trucking fleet, in which SmartDrive cameras monitor freight drivers for signs of fatigue and distracted driving, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-amazons-trucking-ambitions"&gt;separate report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNbHUY"&gt;The marketing video showcases how the cameras record “100% of the time” (though without audio and not viewable live) and upload footage to a dedicated safety team for review if any one of 16 signals is triggered through an incident happening on the road or an action the driver takes. The driver is able to manually disable the camera, but only when the ignition is off. Drivers are also allowed to manually upload footage when they choose to. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yv7OFtakQ7D0kMonzGrFoJPZc_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279686/amazon_netradyne_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LSxCh1"&gt;“We’re always searching out innovative ways to keep drivers safe. That’s why we have partnered with Netradyne to help make improvements to the driver experience,” Haraldsdottir says on camera. She describes Netradyne as the first company to merge AI with video “to create industry-leading safety systems, reducing collisions by a third through in-cab warnings and another third through improving driver behaviors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY8tMw"&gt;Haraldsdottir says Amazon wants to “set up drivers for success and provide them support for being safer on road and handling incidents if and when they happen.” But &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;talked with some drivers who are concerned the use of Netradyne’s technology might constitute unfair and invasive surveillance and place even further burdens on them as they try to meet tight deadlines. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GZVGF1Ak6qE_2bNnt6zN8GgCuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279685/amazon_netradyne_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i68Q0j"&gt;Amazon has historically relied on last-mile operators like the US Postal Service and UPS to get packages to customers’ doorsteps, but the company has increasingly begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;using its own growing logistics network&lt;/a&gt; of airplanes, trucks, and delivery vehicles to cut costs. For last-mile deliveries, that has included both third-party delivery companies Amazon contracts directly and a growing platform of Uber-like workers using their own vehicles under the Amazon Flex platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZoH47"&gt;As part of this network, Amazon operates a fleet of tens of thousands of delivery drivers all over the country that, as part of these third-party firms, are not technically company employees. Nonetheless, these drivers operate Amazon Prime-branded vehicles and are subject to any restrictions or monitoring the company puts in place in many ways similar to the intense control Amazon exerts over its warehouse workers. That includes minute-by-minute surveillance via mobile app of where a driver is on their programmed route and whether they’re falling behind schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4R4Vkjjv2QNp6eV0S-5Bog7ennI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279672/amazon_netradyne_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4I3AVv"&gt;Those monitoring tools appear to also include new Netradyne cameras, although &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says it’s not clear when Amazon intends to install the cameras and how widespread throughout its delivery fleet they’ll be. “We are investing in safety across our operations and recently started rolling out industry leading camera-based safety technology across our delivery fleet,” an Amazon spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcrFjL"&gt;In using its own network of both professional and civilian delivery drivers, Amazon has faced scrutiny in recent years for prioritizing speed and consumer convenience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035849/amazon-delivery-network-safety-speed-buzzfeed-propublica-report"&gt;over the safety of delivery personnel&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time placing increasingly onerous restrictions and requirements on its drivers dictating the route they take and the order in which they drop off packages to avoid delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IJ6RsL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is stepping up its surveillance of contract workers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSv6c2"&gt;Last fall, Amazon was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418057/amazon-surveilling-flex-delivery-drivers-facebook-groups-subreddits-strikes-protests"&gt;caught surveilling contract Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; in private Facebook groups to see whether some were planning labor actions like work stoppages or strikes. In March of last year, Amazon came under fire for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168724/amazon-flex-coronavirus-warner-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-instacart-doordash"&gt;declining to pay Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; forced to stay home due to the coronavirus, despite Uber and Lyft opting to compensate their drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kHeLF"&gt;Amazon delivery drivers have also caused dozens of accidents over the last half-decade, including some that resulted in deaths, but the company often avoids liability for the accidents due to the way it employs third-party firms and independent contractors, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html"&gt;reported &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Just earlier this week, Amazon was ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;pay more than $61 million to Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over wage theft allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqQZ7E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 3rd, 7:59PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from Amazon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check out these new videos from Super Nintendo World in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bct66zrHPuyvpKXXLaA24KYZWY=/163x29:1278x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765471/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_5.12.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="795d5Y"&gt;Today, the fan site Universal Parks News Today &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv_E2dSTHw4&amp;amp;list=PLy9eoiZLpVdIB_HEfawrE6qGXm935KAbO"&gt;dropped a slew of videos from inside Japan’s Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt; that show what the whole experience of going to the park is like. It’s a cool look at what’s sure to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189601/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-universal-studios-japan-mario-shigeru-miyamoto"&gt;a very popular post-COVID destination for Nintendo fans&lt;/a&gt;. From what I can tell, the park seems stuffed with people and attractions. It looks surprisingly normal, though everyone is wearing a mask. They went on every ride! They tried all the food! It’s guaranteed to make you want to go yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rjLvPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQpKApIRE_0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sgxDB4"&gt;What’s a little stranger is the videos show the park stuffed with people, but it’s not supposed to be open yet. The original plan was to open the Osaka park on February 4th, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230412/super-nintendo-world-opening-date-delay-osaka-japan"&gt;but a state of emergency was declared&lt;/a&gt;. Universal Studios Japan &lt;a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/company/news/2021/0114.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the park wouldn’t set a new opening date until the emergency declaration was lifted, and there’s no word on when that might be yet. In the meantime, you can tour the entire park through Universal Parks News Today’s videos to take the edge off while you plan your own trip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 in silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in gold&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has this model on sale for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 in silver with a white sport band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast is delaying its rollout of 1.2TB data caps that would have hit 12 states in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comcast sign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzNoJseOeFmZ3_ym_P7v0RLx1Ws=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765466/Comcast_sign.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ8L2R"&gt;If you live in one of the twelve states where Comcast is planning to roll out 1.2TB data caps, we have some moderately good news: you won’t have to start monitoring your bill for extra charges until July. The ISP &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;had planned to start&lt;/a&gt; charging customers $10-and-up fees for using more than 1.2TB of data starting this March, but the rollout has been delayed (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/03/comcast-suspends-data-caps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This gives us a few more months until the scourge of Comcast home internet data caps are truly nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSOEqb"&gt;The areas affected are in Comcast’s Northeast region: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as parts of North Carolina and Ohio. If you live in one of those areas, your bill in August could have up to $100 of overage fees for your July use. That’s a lot of extra money, but at least now you have a bit more time to see if you’ll be affected and to make a plan if you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S7YU0s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Of course, Comcast is happy to sell customers an unlimited plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m58ICX"&gt;The cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;was scheduled to roll out this March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s being delayed after Pennsylvania’s attorney general raised objections, saying that now, when we’re struggling with the pandemic and using the internet for work and school, is “not the time to change the rules when it comes to internet data usage and increase costs.” After negotiations, Comcast has agreed to not only push back the data cap start date, but to also waive early cancellation fees for customers who don’t want to be subjected to the caps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/at-ag-shapiros-urging-comcast-delays-new-data-thresholds/"&gt;a press release from the attorney general’s office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHzdZ"&gt;While Comcast customers in the region are probably happy for the delay, the ability to cancel your service with no fees is only useful if you have another ISP that will provide you service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;which many across the US do not&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;has had data caps for a while&lt;/a&gt;, and people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/23/11494510/comcast-att-wsj-data-cap-report"&gt;haven’t liked them&lt;/a&gt;. Yet they’ve rolled out anyway because the ISPs have basically no real competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="itm40i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"},{"title":"Most Comcast customers now have a 1TB home internet data cap","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DdsjFY"&gt;Comcast is, however, giving its low-income customers a bit of a break. It announced that it was doubling the speeds of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261402/comcast-internet-essentials-doubling-speed-uploads"&gt;Internet Essentials plan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and it’s apparently not going to be imposing data caps on that plan for the rest of 2021. Comcast confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this policy was nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAV19i"&gt;The 1.2TB-plus overage fees will come to the Northeast in July, showing up on August bills. If you go over the 1.2TB limit, you’ll have to pay $10 for every additional 50GB, with the fees capped at $100. You do get one “courtesy” month, where if you go over you won't be charged extra, but after that the fees will start rolling in. Of course, if you find yourself going over often, Comcast is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fexp-unlimited-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;happy to upgrade you&lt;/a&gt; to unlimited data for only $30 a month or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Finternet-service%2Fdata&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as part of a $25-a-month xFi Complete bundle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jFcFtlR92GeenTLIV-guQW8N0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279627/HOW11276_121719_03.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comcast shows your data usage in its app or on its website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="za899U"&gt;If you live in the Northeast and are worried about your bill going up come July, Comcast &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fdata-usage-usage-history&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a tool to check how much data you use&lt;/a&gt;. Since that usage is what they’ll be billing you for, you can see if you’re typically over 1.2TB of usage or not — and now, you’ll have a few more months to figure out what to do if you’re consistently over. It is possible you won’t be, though. Back when I had a data cap, I generally stayed under, and I’m a pretty heavy internet user who backs up a lot of photo and video to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lonFK7"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
