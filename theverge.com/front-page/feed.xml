    <title>Google considered buying ‘some or all’ of Epic during Fortnite clash, court documents say</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrXeKy"&gt;Google considered buying Epic Games as the companies sparred over Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Android app, according to &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.159.5.pdf"&gt;newly unsealed court filings&lt;/a&gt;. Last night, Google lifted some of its redactions in Epic’s antitrust complaint against Google, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;Epic amended and refiled&lt;/a&gt; last month. The complaint still omits many details about Google’s dealings with specific companies, but the new details reflect internal Google communications about competition on the Android platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INWwJm"&gt;Epic claims Google was threatened by its plans to sidestep Google’s official Play Store commission by distributing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through other channels, and in an unredacted segment, it quotes an internal Google document calling Epic’s plans a “contagion” threatening Google. Here’s Epic’s description of the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CPWveA"&gt;Google has gone so far as to share its monopoly profits with business partners to secure their agreement to fence out competition, has developed a series of internal projects to address the “contagion” it perceived from efforts by Epic and others to offer consumers and developers competitive alternatives, and has even contemplated buying some or all of Epic to squelch this threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fS8Kau"&gt;The internal messages discussing that possibility remain secret, and the complaint doesn’t indicate that Google ever reached out to Epic with these plans. It also doesn’t give a timeframe for the discussion — although it presumably happened after Epic started its plans to launch &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Android in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vptrsW"&gt;Epic has also alleged that Google offered it a “special deal” to launch &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the Play Store. In another unsealed section, the complaint describes a Google Play manager reaching out to Epic about its plans to sideload &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;— and apparently admitting that sideloading is a “frankly abysmal” experience in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="a7s2R3"&gt;One manager contacted Epic’s Vice President and Co-Founder to gauge Epic’s interest in a special deal and, among other things, discussed “the experience of getting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Android” via direct downloading. The manager’s call notes state that she viewed direct downloading &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as “frankly abysmal” and “an awful experience”, and that Epic should “worry that most will not go through the 15+ steps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtn6co"&gt;Another section says that “staff members have acknowledged internally that the difficulty Google imposes on consumers who wish to direct download leads to a ‘[p]oor user experience,’ in that there are ‘15+ steps to get app [via sideloading] vs 2 steps with Play or on iOS.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXsgkm"&gt;Overall, “Google understands that the myriad barriers it erects to direct downloading have the effect of protecting its app distribution monopoly and limiting developers’ ability to distribute their apps,” Epic alleges in its complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7VDskJ"&gt;In an internal document titled “Response to Epic”, a Google employee explained that the “install friction” associated with direct downloading was “not only a bad experience” for users but that Google knew “from its data that it will drastically limit [Epic’s] reach”. The document goes on to explain that “[f]uture [&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;] updates will be challenged re: targeting, update experience via web”; that the direct downloading approach was “most associated with malicious apps”, which would be “incompatible with [Epic’s] brand/demographics”; and that “[t]he approach will create significant user confusion, since [Google Play] will still attract [billions] of users who will search for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and run into deadends that aren’t clear how to resolve”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cFM5Yg"&gt;Epic’s lawsuit was recently linked with a much bigger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;state antitrust complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt;. Like Epic, a group of state attorneys general alleges that Android is much less open than Google claims, saying it cuts create deliberate barriers — including Android phone features and deals with phone makers — to restrict third-party app stores and discourage downloading apps directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zK36MC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has called Epic’s lawsuit “meritless”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uqMigR"&gt;Google also removed some redactions in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.159.3.pdf"&gt;the state complaints&lt;/a&gt;, mostly relating to its internal descriptions of how Android works. In a 2017 presentation about Amazon’s App Store, for instance, Google apparently noted that “if we were honest we would admit that most users and developers aren’t consciously ‘choosing’ they are going with the default.” And in 2019, it referred to Apple and Android as “new closed internet ecosystems” that “centralized content distribution via app stores… [and] payments via app store services” — although the larger context of those remarks isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wegBHb"&gt;Google has strongly denied the claims in both suits. “The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users,” it said in a previous comment on Epic’s amended filing. “While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. We will continue to defend ourselves against these meritless claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJN2R"&gt;Epic filed lawsuits against both Apple and Google last year after it introduced a new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; payment system that sidestepped their payment systems and in-app purchase commissions, leading both companies to kick &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off their mobile stores. (&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is still available on Android devices via sideloading.) Epic’s case against Apple went to trial in May and is currently awaiting a ruling from the court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Bitcoin tax plans could stifle greener blockchain tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_DbxJX6oXJJeyM3-xmBU1CfR14=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69688305/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrtts"&gt;Ongoing efforts to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill could reshape the cryptocurrency world, as lawmakers debate new tax-reporting requirements on various parts of the blockchain system. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that, on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directly lobbied lawmakers to keep stronger cryptocurrency tax provisions in the infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4g880"&gt;It’s a sign of how committed the White House is to bringing cryptocurrency into the broader tax-reporting system, even as the details of the new requirements threaten to upset the delicate political balance of the infrastructure plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c7xhHI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A broad new requirement on cryptocurrency brokers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehXjZp"&gt;From the beginning, the drafters of the bipartisan infrastructure framework hoped to offset the rush of new spending with $28 billion in new cryptocurrency taxes (levied over 10 years). Broadly, the tax proposals have been uncontroversial — but the details of who will bear the burden of reporting transactions have been maddeningly difficult to agree upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzLslD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;The initial bill text released on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; placed a broad new requirement on cryptocurrency brokers to report transactions as part of their tax returns, similar to existing requirements for trading conventional assets. But the original text left the definition of a “broker” vague, potentially extending to wallet developers or miners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WarTYF"&gt;An amendment from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17606974/oregon-senator-ron-wyden-interview-internet-section-230-net-neutrality"&gt;Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR)&lt;/a&gt;, Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Pat Toomey (R-PA) would explicitly exempt miners from any reporting requirements, but the amendment has yet to pass. More recently, a group of lawmakers led by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18056610/facebook-mark-warner-congress-cambridge-analytica"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)&lt;/a&gt; has offered a slightly harsher compromise, which has gained more support in Congress but left many cryptocurrency advocates uncomfortable. In particular, advocates are concerned that the uneven reporting requirements in the Warner amendment could lead to a lasting split between different blockchain technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GT9Yke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is no way to make policy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcDiYe"&gt;Most cryptocurrency still relies on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, which require energy-intensive mining to certify new entries on the blockchain. But a new model of blockchain would allow miners to certify blocks by staking a certain amount of currency (hence “proof-of-stake”), thus allowing for faster and more complex transactions. Proof-of-stake blockchains are still less popular, but some larger coins (&lt;a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/"&gt;most notably Zcash&lt;/a&gt;) are actively considering a switch to the new mode. Ethereum is &lt;a href="https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/eth-2-faq"&gt;in the process of launching&lt;/a&gt; its own staked blockchain, called Ethereum 2.0 or ETH2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsdTZ1"&gt;The Warner amendment defines “broker” to include proof-of-stake miners but not proof-of-work miners, due to the additional complexity and financial flexibility of proof-of-stake mining. But cryptocurrency groups worry that the additional regulatory burden will drive coins away from proof-of-stake systems, stifling the new innovation before it has a chance to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM9BRI"&gt;“The language in the new amendment enshrines one of many competing technologies in law,” Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is the government picking a winner on an otherwise competitive field. And worst of all, tech policy of this magnitude is being done as last minute tax provision buried in a massive must-pass infrastructure bill. This is no way to make policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8t84v"&gt;The split is particularly divisive given the intense energy demands of proof-of-work mining, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;a long-standing sore point for cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; that many had hoped proof-of-stake systems would address. In a tweet Thursday night, Sen. Wyden criticized the Warner amendment through the lens of climate policy, calling it “a government-sanctioned safe harbor for the most climate-damaging form of crypto tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GfzNj"&gt;Most Bitcoin groups, including Coin Center, are now pushing for the Wyden amendment as the least damaging option, despite the White House’s lobbying. “This will not happen without your elected reps hearing from you,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1423044785166864390"&gt;said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. “Please contact your senators and ask them to support the amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYCcJacwoXruHGMTQ1O8R-0y1zg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69688190/Vesemir_Character.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDKE91"&gt;Perhaps the most emblematic image of Netflix’s take on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is Henry Cavill as Geralt, giant shoulders sunken, muttering a raspy “fuck” as he realizes the depths of the problem in front of him. Geralt’s gruffness is a big part of the appeal of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, as his down-to-earth nature stands in contrast to many other fantasy stories full of royalty and long-prophesied saviors. He’s not out to be a hero; he’s just here to do a job. Saving the world just seems to happen whether he wants to be involved or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1antd"&gt;When it came time to create &lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, a prequel that stars Geralt’s mentor Vesemir, producer and screenplay writer Beau DeMayo knew he wanted a very different kind of character. Across video games, books, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;a live-action show&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve seen plenty of the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe from Geralt’s perspective. It was time for something new — and a lot less serious. “Geralt grunts at a problem,” DeMayo tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Vesemir winks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxWuQF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; is a feature-length anime that debuts on Netflix on August 23rd. Animation was handled by Studio Mir — which previously worked on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Boondocks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22346867/dota-dragons-blood-netflix-anime-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — while DeMayo penned the story. He says he initially came up with the treatment while working on season 1 of the live-action Netflix show (DeMayo wrote the third episode), and then crafted &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;’s story in the lead-up to season 2. “In many ways it was like getting to write the same show twice in two different formats,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7iHDlp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZANFe4zS-yk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl2Oiq"&gt;The setting and character of the movie were interesting, he says, because &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is “at its core about families and how we pass along what we learn to future generations.” As Geralt’s mentor and father figure, Vesemir was the ideal protagonist. It allowed the team to explore a new time period, before the events of the show, but also have an entirely different kind of lead. Vesemir and Geralt are both witchers, mutated mercenaries who kill monsters in exchange for gold, but their personalities are completely opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adwreT"&gt;“I was thinking about my own relationship to my parents and how so much of my identity is formed in opposition to what my parents are,” DeMayo explains. “And so if Geralt is the grumpiest person alive, it made sense to me that Vesemir would be an extrovert and this kind of charismatic character. Where it became interesting for me was taking the world we knew through Geralt’s point of view, which is a hard world with a hard character, and then we put this life-loving, pleasure-seeking character in that same world, and see how he interacts with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uN4nNa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Geralt grunts at a problem. Vesemir winks.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IrZdXg"&gt;One of the big changes for DeMayo was shifting to longer-form narrative. Across mediums &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is typically built on episodic storytelling, whether that’s a collection of short stories, a game based around lots of quests, or a live-action show. It fits the character well, as Geralt is essentially a traveling sword-for-hire, venturing to new towns to fight monsters and reluctantly solve problems. It’s often structured like a fantasy detective story. That didn’t work for a full-length film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdyWqf"&gt;“It felt like the longest sidequest in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; video game,” DeMayo says of the process. “Episodically, it’s a little bit easier, a little more contained to tell those stories. The [points of view] episodically, you usually have one or two characters; here it’s a bit more of an ensemble. I think that’s probably why we have a really big quest section. That’s the thing that really came into the longer format, it allowed us to lean into the traditional dark fantasy, or just fantasy, idea of the epic quest. The ‘leaving the Shire’ kind of moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnCqZR"&gt;The shift to animation also had its benefits. As well as Cavill was able to inhabit Geralt, he is still a human, saddled by petty problems like “gravity.” This made creating action scenes a bit more fun in the anime. “You’re not constrained by set hours, you’re not constrained by insurance policies, you don’t have to worry about killing an actor,” says DeMayo. Kwang Il Han, director at Studio Mir, points out a much more practical benefit. “The actors had difficulty carrying multiple swords at the same time [in the live-action show], because they were too heavy, so they were only carrying one sword at a time,” he says. “In the anime we don’t have those restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CtFYnbftDn8_VQkFvorPZE64RJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22751348/Tetra_Character.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzFDFr"&gt;For DeMayo, a longtime fan of the franchise, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;was also a chance to get really nerdy and answer some lingering questions about the witchers and their place in the world. In a way, the movie serves a dual purpose. It’s meant to lure in new fans who might use the anime as a starting point, but also satiate longtime &lt;em&gt;Witcher &lt;/em&gt;buffs with some interesting new tidbits of lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iDPYSe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In some cases there are no answers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aattQU"&gt;“What [&lt;em&gt;Witcher &lt;/em&gt;writer Andrzej Sapkowski] did very well is he hinted at things in the backstory, that made you go ‘Ooh, what’s that all about?’ If you’re a really diehard person you’ll probably go on wikis and Reddit and really fall down the rabbit hole to figure out those things,” he says. “And in some cases there are no answers for those things. I do think the prequel gives you some answers to things that we’ve all as &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; fans wondered about for a very long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlE4T6"&gt;Perhaps the most shocking thing fans will notice about Vesemir is that the grizzled old man has turned into a young hottie. “It just happened,” DeMayo says. “I did put dashing in the script, I think. Because in my mind he was a &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; version of Zorro, and Diego is not a bad-looking dude. So I think it probably was my fault.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DURs6"&gt;But that also means that — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586549/witcher-anime-film-teaser-trailer-nightmare-of-the-world-premiere-date-august-23"&gt;as anyone who watched the latest trailer already knows&lt;/a&gt; — young Vesemir seems right at home in yet another &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; bathtub scene. Given &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/19/17028476/witcher-3-geralt-bath-tub-statue-dark-horse-toy-fair"&gt;how prevalent&lt;/a&gt; those have become since the opening sequence of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I had to ask: was it now a prerequisite for all &lt;em&gt;Witcher &lt;/em&gt;stories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBzogo"&gt;“No,” says DeMayo. “I just wanted one.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBsrbe"&gt;The pandemic-delayed return of Netflix’s flagship nostalgia series &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; has a release window: 2022. A brief teaser (stick around for a few new frames near the end) promises that “it” is almost here. While today’s news fulfills director Shawn Levy’s &lt;a href="https://collider.com/stranger-things-season-4-release-date-announcement-when/"&gt;promise&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; press tour that we would know more about &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611123/free-guy-review-ryan-reynolds-jodie-comer-video-game-movie"&gt;that video game movie&lt;/a&gt; is released, it doesn’t go far into spoiler territory but wait, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;who is that holding the flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWKPAd"&gt;Maybe that’s for the best? There’s something to look forward to, albeit three years after the third season premiered. Season 3 set Netflix viewing records (at the time), as the streamer &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/08/stranger-things-3-viewership-sets-record/"&gt;said more than 40 million accounts watched&lt;/a&gt; within four days of its release.  If you can’t wait another five months or more to see how tall Will, Eleven, and the rest of the gang are now, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/stranger-things-season-4-premiere-date-trailer-1234810287/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the teaser trailer will also air on NBC tonight during coverage of the Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s 27-inch QHD gaming monitor is 25 percent off at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYWNH5odV11F5OZ_t7ICGGIhI4Y=/0x0:1155x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69688000/lgultragearlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o10KG3"&gt;Gaming monitors can be a very expensive component of building or upgrading your PC. If you don’t want to shell out $500 or more, Best Buy has an attractive deal on a monitor that ticks a lot of boxes for the cost. LG’s 27-inch UltraGear costs $300 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748323878573797617#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YGZL8XF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from $400, and it has a 1440p IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and fast 1ms response time. For adaptive sync, it has both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. It has slim bezels with up to 350 nits of brightness for its display. Around its back, there are two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJIHmK"&gt;If you’re ready to make the jump from 1080p to 1440p, this seems like a fantastic monitor at the right price. It doesn’t have HDMI 2.1 ports, but &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/lg/27gn800-b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to review site &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it has variable refresh rate (VRR) support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUJG7K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10429642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wXKAe5"&gt;Apple’s Smart Keyboard folio cases for the 11-inch iPad Pro, the fourth-gen iPad Air, and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablets &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-mu8h2ll-a-apple-smart-keyboard-folio-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_7_9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $110 new at Woot until stock sells out&lt;/a&gt;. This is far less than what many retailers are selling them for. The 11-inch model usually goes for $150, while the larger keyboard is priced a little higher. This folio case can provide multiple viewing angles. Importantly, it can cover both the front and back of your iPad when the folio is closed. These have a one-year warranty through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j0RiNj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="uebqA1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="These Sony earbuds do what AirPods can’t|70136" data-volume-uuid="9511ba7c9" data-volume-id="70136" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-995" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WnXUHU"&gt;If you’re willing to entertain a deal on refurbished earbuds, &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15203131-sony-wf1000xm3-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds-certified-refurbished-with-free-s-h-for-68-tax-at-ebay?src=frontpage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that you can get Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 wireless earphones for a measly $68 at eBay from a seller with great ratings. You can currently choose between the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F264460772531%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22612674%2Flg-27-inch-qhd-1440p-gaming-monitor-g-sync-freesync-apple-keyboard-ipad-sony-wf-1000xm3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F264460772531%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22612674%2Flg-27-inch-qhd-1440p-gaming-monitor-g-sync-freesync-apple-keyboard-ipad-sony-wf-1000xm3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; colors. Once you add one to your cart, the code &lt;strong&gt;B2SCRSAVING &lt;/strong&gt;will bring the price down to $68 before tax. This purchase is eligible for free shipping. This eBay listing says the “product functions like new and shows minimal if any, signs of wear. All standard accessories included.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0QBpP"&gt;The WF-1000XM4 that recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are better all-around than the XM3&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re significantly pricier at this moment in time. At less than $100, this deal’s price seems like a great value for the older model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scMaL7yhAqctduO7lUG16ZZ6KzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687901/awhite_200223_3916_0446.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Shopping for a phone plan doesn’t have to be painful&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sWASXY"&gt;Some of us get excited about shopping for a new phone (New technology! Megapixels! Fancy screen!), but none of us enjoy shopping for a new phone plan. Spending any amount of time at a wireless retail store is not high on our list of things to do with our precious time on this planet. And yet we must. While we can’t promise to make it an enjoyable experience, we can help you do a little homework ahead of time to make it less painful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQUpt4"&gt;If you prefer to cut right to the chase, we’ve got two recommendations from the major US carriers for you: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone-plans%2Fessentials&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’re looking for unlimited, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon’s 10GB Shared Data plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you’d rather have a set amount of data each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObrwNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682646" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EVX5wr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682697" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YxiK3j"&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials plan is your best bet for a cheap phone plan with unlimited data: at $60 per month for a single line, it’s the least expensive unlimited plan from a major carrier and includes some nice extras like wireless hotspot data (at slower 3G speeds, but better than none at all — which is what you’ll get on comparable plans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGcWlt"&gt;Verizon’s 10GB Shared Data plan is $65 per month for a single line and should provide plenty of data for most people. Verizon lets you roll over unused data and includes mobile hotspot usage for no extra fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZtrZO"&gt;We’ll go into more detail about these plans and some of our recommendations for the best cheap unlimited plan, best premium unlimited plan, and best cheap by-the-gig plan a bit later, but first, take a look at a few things to consider before you pick a plan. If you also happen to be shopping for a new device, we’ve got suggestions for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_qJ3xeWXCnCBAPAWbr7rMnn2vM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13250625/akrales_181010_3013_0161.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nUzok3"&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fL0aST"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10686366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTOBax"&gt;This is an obvious — and important — first consideration in your mobile plan shopping process. On a high level, you’ll want to know which wireless carriers cover your area. If you’re in or near a major city, you’re pretty much guaranteed service from any of the major carriers. If you’re in a rural area, you may have fewer choices and a smaller, regional carrier might serve your needs better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5Jvjw"&gt;Carriers’ published coverage maps are a good starting point. They’re not reliable enough to gauge coverage in a particular neighborhood or on your street, but they can help identify carriers without a significant presence in your area. Check US Cellular’s coverage, too, since it tends to offer service where some of the major carriers don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3O97am"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; provides a thorough, balanced evaluation of the major carriers’ network performance across the country every year; &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2020"&gt;take a look at 2020’s results&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/which-us-5g-network-is-fastest-were-revving-up-to-find-out"&gt;keep an eye out for 2021 results soon&lt;/a&gt;. And it doesn’t hurt to poll your co-workers and neighbors about their wireless service for more data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FHTFCl"&gt;Budget basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xeRavP"&gt;When you start shopping around, you’ll see some very attractive prices on the major carriers’ unlimited plans, like $30 or $45 per month. Remember that those are prices &lt;em&gt;per line&lt;/em&gt; on your account, and the prices carriers like to show you are based on their best per line rate, which is usually available when you have four or five lines. If you’re shopping for a single line, expect to spend around $70 per month, plus taxes and fees in most cases. For four lines, expect around $140 for your total bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LEeRV"&gt;The quoted prices on carriers’ websites also include a discount for signing up for autopay. If you’re not comfortable signing up for autopay, you’ll need to add a little more to your monthly bill — $10 per line per month in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="702rIO"&gt;Shared data versus unlimited&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DnX0ZR"&gt;Plan costs add up fast, but there are ways to save a little bit if you’re okay with looking outside of the big carriers’ marquee plans. If you’re a lighter data user, a shared data plan with a set allotment of data per month can save you a bit of money. AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon both offer such plans starting around $50 per month for a single line. (All of T-Mobile’s plans offer some kind of “unlimited” data service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaXT4w"&gt;Shared data plans seem to be on their way out, and carriers will be much happier to steer you toward an unlimited plan. There are some downsides to shared data plans, too. They tend to be limited to 4G or low-band 5G, which isn’t a big deal now but could be in the next few years. But on the plus side, both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T allow mobile hotspot use on their shared data plans, which isn’t an option on either carrier’s basic unlimited plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0GJll"&gt;Which brings us to one of the great mysteries of carrier unlimited plans: they aren’t really unlimited. Even the most expensive unlimited plans include limitations on how much data you can use via mobile hotspot. Most plans also include monthly data thresholds that, once exceeded, leave you subject to temporary slowdowns in times when the network is busy. Before you pick an unlimited plan, it’s a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;read up on the fine print&lt;/a&gt; so you know just what you are (and aren’t) getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePTP7Pj9AsZJelzBrpC_kv5cKl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11579471/akrales_180620_1777_0481.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wEQp9g"&gt;MVNOs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Fwtn3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10685640"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CN3dzx"&gt;Signing up with a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) can also help you save some money. These companies resell service on the major carriers’ networks, so with a couple of exceptions, you’re getting access to the same network for less money. These plans are better suited for those who don’t need the absolute best network speeds because they typically include lower prioritization thresholds than the major network plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7hMrT"&gt;Many MVNOs are set up to operate without retail locations, too, which could be a positive or a negative depending on if you prefer to walk into a store to troubleshoot issues with your connectivity. They’re also more eagerly adopting eSIM, which many newer phones support and which removes the need to wait for a physical SIM card to pop into your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQzs7e"&gt;Generally, you’ll find more plan options with set data limits per month than the few shared data options that remain with the big carriers. You’ll also find more prepaid options and fewer requirements like credit checks or contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2YDxaJ"&gt;Prepaid versus postpaid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="tFCoEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10685643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCKEFj"&gt;In addition to MVNO prepaid options, the big three carriers also offer their own prepaid plans. These plans don’t require credit checks, but you’re still getting your service and customer support directly from the network operator. There are data-capped and unlimited data options across the board, and if you’re willing to spend more, you can get premium features like HD streaming video and mobile hotspot data that not even all postpaid unlimited plans include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjDshy"&gt;Prepaid plans directly from the big carriers can also be nearly as expensive as postpaid. Depending on your situation, it may make sense to pay a little more per month for a postpaid plan or go with an MVNO for a better price. But they’re a decent option, especially if you’re looking for a single-line plan, have predictable data usage habits, and need to avoid the credit check on postpaid plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3gBzjR"&gt;Best phone plans in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SSIljM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our plan recommendations take into account cost, features, and restrictions imposed on the carrier plans we evaluated. They should be considered along with network performance in your area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ei18fC"&gt;At $60 per month for a single line, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone-plans%2Fessentials&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s Essentials&lt;/a&gt; is the least expensive of the major carriers. Assuming T-Mobile coverage in your area is sufficient, it offers the best value for someone who just wants to stay connected and not worry about data overages. Plus, it includes 3G hotspot data and access to all flavors of T-Mobile’s already-strong 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi9lYS"&gt;It’s always subject to data slowdowns when the network is busy, but so are the other carriers’ basic unlimited plans. T-Mobile may impose additional slowdowns for users who go over 50GB of data in a month, so if you’re a heavy data user, you may want to consider a more expensive unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnoIck"&gt;T-Mobile offers a handy way to test-drive its network on your own phone without switching from your current provider. It’s only available with certain iPhones right now, and you should be aware that you might experience faster speeds than you’ll actually get with data prioritization on the Essentials plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoeptR"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10682646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EncFUu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5g314D"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ymV6yH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best premium unlimited plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Play More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$80 / month for a single line (with autopay)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dSigOl"&gt;The major carriers offer two pricier “step-up” plans with the exception of Verizon — it offers three, but the middle two are essentially the same except for the mix of included services. For very heavy data users and those who want the highest possible streaming video quality, the top tier plans make the most sense, but for most people, one of the middle-of-the-road options is likely a better fit. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s Play More Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; (and nearly identical Do More) plan isn’t the cheapest option, but it strikes the best balance of cost versus features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj6Tfo"&gt;You’ll get 720p HD video streaming (though this needs to be enabled in your Verizon account) along with a healthy 15GB of mobile hotspot data and a 50GB threshold of premium data before slowdowns can be imposed. Crucially, it includes access to Verizon’s Ultra Wideband (UW) 5G, which will become important over the next few years as it brings new spectrum online. You get super-fast but hard to find mmWave 5G, too, which isn’t worth upgrading for, but it’s part of the UW bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOY5Dj"&gt;Finally, the included services are worthwhile. Play More includes access to Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus, which is shared across all lines on the account. If you’re not interested in those streaming services, Do More includes 600GB of Verizon Cloud storage as an alternative, though, honestly, that sounds like a lot less fun than having nine seasons of &lt;em&gt;Letterkenny&lt;/em&gt; included with your phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8N4bl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685853"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7d2fg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best family plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Play More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$180 / month for four lines (with autopay)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YNWBrA"&gt;Verizon’s Play More is also our top pick for families. Four standard lines will cost $45 each for a total of $180 per month, but parents with younger kids can mix and match the standard plan with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s Just Kids plans&lt;/a&gt;, which are cheaper and offer parental control features. Just Kids lines come with a limit of up to 20 contacts for talk and text, and speeds capped at 5Mbps — good for a younger kid whose phone use you want to keep closer tabs on but not well-suited for older kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGmyt7"&gt;At least one unlimited plan line is required to add Just Kids lines, which are $35 each for an account with four lines, making a plan with two Play More lines and two Just Kids lines $160 per month. And Disney Plus included with the price of the plan doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tn0aVJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GtZ2fZ"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KrlGCb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best postpaid shared data plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon Shared Data Plan — 10GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$65 / month&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KapvP3"&gt;We think &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePhonePlans08052021/https://www.verizon.com/plans/shared-data/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s $65 per month 10GB plan&lt;/a&gt; provides the best bang for your shared-data buck compared to its 5GB plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4GB plan (T-Mobile doesn’t offer postpaid shared data plans). However, if you buy a phone from Verizon on a two-year contract, that monthly price goes up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFCXUf"&gt;The 10GB plan typically costs $40 per month for account access and an additional $25 per month per line (with autopay), adding up to $65 per month for a plan with a single line. If you’re on a two-year device contract, that $25 fee per line per month goes up to $40 — with or without autopay enabled — so you’ll pay $80 per month for a single line plus the cost of the phone itself, which varies depending on the model. If you prefer buying your phone through your carrier on a two-year plan, then an unlimited plan may make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBAB6t"&gt;Otherwise, the 10GB plan is about the same price as the company’s basic unlimited plan but comes with the ability to stream video at 720p (once enabled for your account) and use your data via a mobile hotspot. You can also carry unused data over to the next billing cycle, and use your data on other non-phone connected devices like a tablet for an extra $10 per month per device; unlimited requires a separate device plan starting at $10 per month for a smartwatch or $20 for a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b8q5vP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685884"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Jgd2CY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oVlryv"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6KFJ2Z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best cheap phone plan (by the gig): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/plans/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Fi Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting at $30 / month for a single line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T7sKQo"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap data-capped phone plan is &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/plans/"&gt;Google Fi Flexible&lt;/a&gt;, which costs between $30 and $80 per month. It isn’t the least expensive, and it’s certainly not the one with the easiest pricing structure to comprehend. But it does live up to its “Flexible” name and offers some inclusions that cost extra on other plans, like mobile hotspot data and additional SIMs for non-phone devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4jQDm"&gt;Here’s how it works: on the Flexible plan, you prepay a set access fee per line at the start of every month, depending on the number of lines on your account. (It’s $20 for one line.) At the end of that, you pay $10 for every 1GB of data used during the month, up to a set maximum amount determined by, again, the number of lines on your plan. That’s 6GB on a single-line plan, so your plan will cost at most $80 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9wbPA"&gt;You can keep using data beyond that limit, but you won’t be charged more, and you won’t experience drastic slowdowns until you reach 15GB. At that point, you’ll be dropped down to 2G speeds for the rest of the month unless you add more data at $10 / GB. Again — not the cheapest plan by any means — but if you can get by most months on 2 or 3GB of data, your $40 or $50 bill will look pretty good compared to most alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zugdMm"&gt;It’s a little bit more complicated than your typical phone plan, but it means you’re only paying for the data you use in a month — with a lot of flexibility built in if you need to use a little or a lot more data than usual in a typical billing cycle. And it includes a somewhat rare feature: the option to add data-only SIMs at no extra charge so you can use your plan across other devices like tablets and smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U9Psqx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685910"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GWgECJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682574"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jsQiQH"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fhbd29"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best cheap unlimited phone plan: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fproduct%2F12-month-unlimited-sim-card-plan%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mint Mobile 12-month Unlimited Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$30 / month (pre-pay $360)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BXc1NS"&gt;Going by raw numbers alone, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fproduct%2F12-month-unlimited-sim-card-plan%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22606623%2Fbest-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mint Mobile’s $30-per-month unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; stands out with easily the lowest monthly cost for unlimited data. However, to get that price you’ll need to prepay for 12 months of service for a sizable $360 upfront cost. New customers can try the service for three months at that $30 rate. But after that, you’ll need to renew for the full year or pay a little more for a six-month plan ($35 per month for an upfront cost of $210). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh5oxm"&gt;If paying up front is doable for you, then you’ll get one of the best deals in wireless. The plan includes 5G, comes with 5GB of mobile hotspot data per month, and you won’t experience significant slowdowns unless you surpass 35GB of data in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlENcl"&gt;If paying for six or 12 months of service up front isn’t the best option for you, then we think &lt;a href="https://visible.pxf.io/c/482924/1068329/12909?subId1=VergePhonePlans08052021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visible.com%2Fplan%2F"&gt;Visible’s $40 per month standard plan&lt;/a&gt; is the next best option. Visible runs on Verizon’s network (and is, in fact, owned by Verizon) and includes some perks you won’t even get on Verizon’s own basic unlimited plan. You’ll get UW 5G access — capped at 200Mbps, but still, probably at least as good as your home Wi-Fi. Mobile hotspot usage is also included, though it is capped at 5Mbps. That’s a bit slower than 4G, so you won’t want to rely on it as a primary connection for your laptop, but it’s good enough for basic internet browsing and email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxZkPP"&gt;Of course, Visible customers are more likely to see their speeds slow down compared to Verizon’s own subscribers when the network gets busy, so there is some benefit to signing up directly with the network. But it’s a significant step up from $40 per month to the $70-per-month Verizon Start Unlimited plan in order to guarantee faster network speeds at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SpJLD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="j797LN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10682576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to use DuckDuckGo’s email protection app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_O0JIUiyxZh6PN-t24m4C2O1_RE=/250x0:1600x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687605/Email_Banner___static.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DuckDuckGo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yItPIR"&gt;It’s well-known that filling in a form with your email address — say, to get a discount on a product, receive a newsletter, or get the results of a quiz — means you are going to get email from that vendor, and possibly from a bunch of other vendors and / or advertisers, forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOtU2N"&gt;One of the ways to subvert this has traditionally been to create a free email account to use for sites that you want to register with but that you suspect will be the gateway for a large amount of spam. This is what I did. However, over time, that designated email account can become so well-used that it stops being a hidey-hole for spam and becomes another account that offers advertisers and others a source for information to aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBxxTa"&gt;This is where DuckDuckGo’s latest product comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyiB0I"&gt;DuckDuckGo is a browser that is known for its security and privacy safeguards. Recently, the company came up with a new feature to help its users keep their info to themselves: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22576352/duckduckgo-email-protection-privacy-trackers-apple-alternative"&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection&lt;/a&gt;. It provides you with a special email address that you can use as an intermediary for sites that you suspect will probably collect data on you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxBGoo"&gt;It works this way: you use your DuckDuckGo address for any site that is suspicious (or just commercial). All email that is sent to that email address will be filtered for hidden trackers and then forwarded to your “normal” email address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1t4nU"&gt;Intrigued? The feature is currently in beta, but you can sign up if you want to give it a try. According to a company rep, they are keeping a waitlist, and people will be picked up from that waitlist “on a week to week basis.” DuckDuckGo is planning to eventually offer invites that its users can distribute as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OP5MWQ"&gt;How to sign up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qOkS5m"&gt;So, with all that in mind, here’s how to sign up and use the new DuckDuckGo Email Protection feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jbshu"&gt;Sign up from the DuckDuckGo mobile app. (You can find links to Apple’s App Store and Google Play &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZqySk"&gt;Once you’ve installed the app, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Email Protection.” Here, you can join the private waitlist (or enter an invite code, if you have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFYn0g"&gt;Your invite will probably come in the form of a link. Go ahead and click the link. You’ll be taken through a series of screens that explain that DuckDuckGo does not save your emails, use your data for advertising, and that your data is encrypted, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6noya"&gt;After you’ve read the usual service terms, you get to choose your unique DuckDuckGo email address (a combination of 3 to 30 letters or numbers which will be appended with @duck.com). You also need to specify an address where your email should be forwarded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DuckDuckGo Email Protection gives you an extra email address to use to avoid trackers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5N9a2NJthjtWLCdZSTtOxs7ce8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763547/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_11.59.41_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection gives you an extra email address to use to avoid trackers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fughzF"&gt;Now, whenever you use the DuckDuckGo email address to fill in a form, any email that is then sent to that DuckDuckGo address — an acknowledgment, an ad, a newsletter, whatever — will first go through DuckDuckGo’s servers and then will be delivered to your usual email address stripped, according to the company, of any trackers that were attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6aF6Yg"&gt;How the beta works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo3ouq"&gt;As I tested out the beta of DuckDuckGo’s email feature I found one or two glitches, but on the whole, it did seem to operate as promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xny9nC"&gt;I signed up at two sites using the duck.com address. The emailed acknowledgment from the first, Allrecipes, took over an hour to appear in my regular Gmail listing. There was a statement at the top that “DuckDuckGo removed trackers from LiveIntent and more.” I clicked on the statement and was taken to a DuckDuckGo website that listed a tracker from LiveIntent (an ad distributor) and Allrecipes itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An email sent through DuckDuckGo will include an accounting of the trackers that were removed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gr8Ln99WU9pKGUl9OrHGmBq4wFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763550/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_4.34.24_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An email sent through DuckDuckGo will include an accounting of the trackers that were removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the tracking report on your email, and you’ll be given more details." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eh0nEju9rVTpFBWIXg5cBDUmZV4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22765803/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_4.34.41_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the tracking report on your email, and you’ll be given more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ugZfuw"&gt;After I signed up with the second retailer, a clothing company called Travelsmith, I got an email from the company in the “Promotions” section of my Gmail account within a few seconds. It told me that “DuckDuckGo removed 1 tracker.” I clicked on the statement; it was a single tracker from Travelsmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3XfVev"&gt;Browser extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0Fijkw"&gt;Right after you register for the email account, DuckDuckGo offers to install an extension on your browser (according to a company rep, the extension is available for all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, and Safari). This extension lets you autofill forms with your DuckDuckGo email address or with a randomly generated address (which will also forward to your chosen email account). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The browser extension lets you autofill fields. (The email address here was edited for privacy.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hU-QNnGcjvVdkZQklsx--Y462zg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763573/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.28.55_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The browser extension lets you autofill fields. (The email address here was edited for privacy.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2st5Ll"&gt;The browser extension comes with several other interesting features. It reports on the number of trackers on the current site and rates it for security. It also enables something called Site Privacy Protection which, &lt;a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/embedded-content-protection/"&gt;according to DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, “blocks social media embedded content by default” in order to prevent tracking codes from being loaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrDxC"&gt;Be aware, though, that this particular feature can interfere with certain sites. For example, it prevented me from typing this article into &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s content management system. Once I realized what the problem was, it was easily fixed: the extension lets you disable the protection for specific sites by just toggling it off. After that, the feature was automatically toggled off every time I visited that site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The browser extension also rates the site you’re on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/848DAzMXSvYb1D6OdjG_OWpfdOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763593/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_11.23.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The browser extension also rates the site you’re on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nrvkMC"&gt;Mobile App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys1gGa"&gt;You can use the email protection feature in DuckDuckGo’s mobile app as well. If you’ve already registered as a beta user, then once you’ve installed the iOS or Android app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="N2R9iW"&gt;In the app, use the three dots in the upper corner to get to Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1cHysa"&gt;Scroll down to find “Email Protection” (it will be marked as beta) and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSKfBg"&gt;You will be asked if you want to join the waitlist, if you have an invite code, or if you already have a Duck address. If you haven’t registered yet, tape on “I have an Invite Code” and you will be led through the registration process. If you’ve already registered, tap on “I already have a Duck Address” and you will be sent a passphrase through the “real” email address that you registered with. Once you’ve entered that passphrase, you’ll be able to use your @duck.com addresses on your mobile device as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find “Email Protection” in the mobile app’s settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1IzuB_vMXS68DiuDEjy_cJiPjIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764611/Screenshot_20210805_163518.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find “Email Protection” in the mobile app’s settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can register for email protection or use your preregistered Duck address." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fn0iMIsYRoHx-9-Jc2EPaimTTnY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764614/Screenshot_20210805_165931.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can register for email protection or use your pre-registered Duck address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eseVzN"&gt;So should you try DuckDuckGo’s email protection if you can get in on the beta? Why not? At the very least, trackers are a pain in the neck; sign up for one service, and suddenly, you’re getting emails from a dozen or more. Having an alternate email address to prevent at least some of the nuisance spam — not to mention preventing other data about you from possibly getting distributed — can’t be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkI0mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s ‘Super Duper Secure Mode’ for Edge trades speed for better security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zI5ZNbDoGchmCb8iUbsrknt2ZhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687559/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UH2OrV"&gt;Microsoft’s browser vulnerability research team is &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/"&gt;working on a mode&lt;/a&gt; to make the Edge browser more secure, and it’s given it an incredible name: “Super Duper Secure Mode” (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/microsoft-announces-new-super-duper-secure-mode-for-edge/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The mode is currently very experimental, but could help make it harder for attackers trying to exploit bugs in Microsoft’s browser by turning off certain optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1fve7"&gt;To make the browser “super duper secure,” the mode turns off a feature of Edge’s JavaScript engine that’s meant to make a website’s code run faster. The technology is called Just-In-Time compilation (or JIT), and while it can help improve performance, it’s also fiendishly complex. This makes it easy for bugs to slip in, which can lead to security exploits — Microsoft points to &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FslzTx4b7sKZK4BR-DpO45JZNB1QZF9wuijK3OxBwr0/edit#gid=865365202"&gt;analysis by Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; that showed that over half of the real-world Chrome exploits since 2018 were related to JIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnDdBq"&gt;(If you’ve got some programming knowledge, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-iiEDtpy6I"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; provides an interesting overview of how Just-In-Time works for JavaScript.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhlEeM"&gt;Of course, there are concerns that turning off technology meant to make a huge part of modern websites run faster could hurt performance. &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/"&gt;The blog post notes&lt;/a&gt; that disabling JIT can lead to significantly lower JavaScript benchmark scores, but the team says that, in the real world, people didn’t usually notice much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bC5JXg"&gt;I can at least somewhat back that up — I turned on Super Duper Secure Mode for myself (if you’re running &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/"&gt;a test version of Edge&lt;/a&gt;, you can enable the mode using a flag), and haven’t noticed any sites feeling particularly sluggish. Of course, everyone’s web use is different, so it’s possible that you’d notice a difference if you spend your days in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/8/4/22610448/kid-pix-html-port-web-art-drawing-memories"&gt;complex webapps&lt;/a&gt;. The Microsoft team does note, though, that it’s looking into making the mode smart by having it turn protections on and off based on the risk a website may pose, or how resource intensive it may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfUH9S"&gt;The experimental mode still seems to be in its very early stages — there are things the team wants to enable but hasn’t, it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423011020524589059?s=20"&gt;doesn’t work on all the platforms that Edge supports&lt;/a&gt;, and the team says there are “quite a few technical challenges to overcome” before the feature launches. It is, however, exciting work being done — since Edge is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321779/microsoft-edge-legacy-spartan-browser-support-ended"&gt;now based on Chromium&lt;/a&gt;, it uses &lt;a href="https://v8.dev/"&gt;the same JavaScript engine&lt;/a&gt; that Chrome does. This makes it conceivable that the feature could end up being adopted by other browsers if it’s successful on Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi3yrh"&gt;As for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snazzyq/status/1179425532875812866"&gt;Tesla-esque name&lt;/a&gt;, vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423011022902759425?s=20"&gt;says that at some point it will have to change&lt;/a&gt;, in part because explaining how secure something described as “super duper secure” is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spoofyroot/status/1423056237281771520"&gt;to lawyers&lt;/a&gt; would be challenging. Still, if there’s any way that Microsoft can make it happen without incurring extra liability (people may understandably be upset if they fell victim to an exploit in Super Duper Secure Mode), it would bring some welcome whimsy to the browser alongside the additional protection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This PS2 mod is a handheld dream come true</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laJwzrp2EZJcLl61vC_GNhoxacE=/0x0:1818x1212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687387/20210626_184744.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: GingerOfOz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PmGxs8"&gt;GingerOfOz, the console modder you might remember from his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;excellent Game Boy-sized portable Wii&lt;/a&gt;, is back with another home console-turned-handheld. This time &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ7x2b6BlHk&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;it’s the turn of the PS2&lt;/a&gt;, objectively the best console ever made and the one that just so happens to be the first I ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWBisA"&gt;Dubbed the “PS2 Eclipse,” the mod involved trimming down an original PS2 motherboard and packing it into a 3D printed chassis with a set of PlayStation Vita buttons, Nintendo Switch joysticks, a 5-inch 480p display, batteries, and a couple of extra custom circuit boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMrz7h"&gt;It’s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; neat little handheld, and the fact that it’s using original PS2 hardware rather than emulation means it doesn’t have any major compatibility issues with the console’s library of almost 4,000 games. That said, the way the console loads games slowly off a USB drive means that some titles can stutter slightly, and load times are apparently a bit arduous. Battery life sits at around two and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6XSzRr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a peek into what the internals look like: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GZjGFv6jvb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GZjGFv6jvb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GingerOfOz (@GingerOfMods) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GingerOfMods/status/1423381531364524032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCbFvK"&gt;Although GingerOfOz has done a great job with the handheld’s usability, including building in speakers, a headphone jack, and a battery life indicator, he admits that it can sometimes struggle to detect that there’s a controller attached. As such, some games will refuse to load, and are effectively unplayable. GingerOfOz says he hopes this can be fixed in software at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1DjEQ"&gt;Unfortunately, if you want to get your hands on the portable, GingerOfOz says he has no plans to sell them like he did with his previous portable Wii. After making fifty of the handheld consoles over the past two years, the modder says that building this many to order “is just miserable.” So if you’re interested in taking your PS2 library on the go, you &lt;a href="https://www.gingerofmods.com/building-your-own-portable"&gt;might need to get your soldering iron and 3D printer ready&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, I thoroughly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDfr25a1fzOgWZFwvIIRuHg"&gt;GingerOfOz’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, and reading his &lt;a href="https://www.gingerofmods.com/eclipse"&gt;full writeup&lt;/a&gt; of what went into the PS2 Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s justification for banning third-party researchers ‘inaccurate,’ says FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7HuCAN4Q5Wrumhkv9ZwobK6W8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69687343/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AuF2oA"&gt;When Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned the personal accounts&lt;/a&gt; of academics researching ad transparency and misinformation on its platform this week, it justified the decision in part by saying it was only following rules set out by the Federal Trade Commission. But the FTC itself says this is “inaccurate” and that its rules require no such action, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/05/facebook-nyu-ftc-dispute/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUoUx9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt;Facebook claims&lt;/a&gt; it banned the accounts “to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people’s privacy in line with our privacy program under the FTC Order.” The &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/c4365facebookmodifyingorder.pdf"&gt;order in question&lt;/a&gt; was put in place following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and says Facebook must obtain “affirmative express consent” from users before sharing their data with a third party (known as the “consent decree”) and maintain a “comprehensive privacy program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wobUTS"&gt;Facebook’s wording about which part of the order from the FTC mandated its actions is ambiguous, but the agency was nonetheless unhappy about its claims. The FTC’s acting director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection, Samuel Levine, complained to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9RFwL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC doesn’t want to be blamed for Facebook’s actions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1vnwm"&gt;“Had you honored your commitment to contact us in advance, we would have pointed out that the consent decree does not bar Facebook from creating exceptions for good-faith research in the public interest,” wrote Levine. “While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apdWGP"&gt;In a later &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-reason-banning-researchers-doesnt-hold-up/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne acknowledged that it was not the FTC’s consent decree that forced its hand, but rather the stipulation that Facebook maintain a “comprehensive privacy program,” which the company says the researchers violated. However, this makes the ban Facebook’s decision, not the FTC’s. If Facebook wanted to it could make allowances in its privacy program for such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEZ852"&gt;The research itself was based on a browser plug-in called Ad Observer, which Facebook users can install to collect information about which political ads they’re shown and why. This information is pooled by the researchers, and used to find out more about political advertising. As well as helping track who is funding political campaigns, this work helps track misinformation on Facebook, as political ads aren’t fact-checked. The Ad Observer plug-in is &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;still live and operational&lt;/a&gt;, but Facebook banned the pages advertising the project on the social network as well as the personal accounts of researchers involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfQVuz"&gt;Facebook also says it banned the plug-in because it violated users’ privacy by collecting information about users who had not installed it. But an independent audit of the plug-in’s code by Mozilla says this claim is also false. As Mozilla’s Marshall Erwin &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis his): “We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency. It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads. &lt;strong&gt;It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhIcXm"&gt;We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
