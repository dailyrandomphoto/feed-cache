    <title>Dish is begging authorities for help with T-Mobile’s CDMA shutdown looming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost Mobile, owned by Dish Network, serves 9 million customers — more than half of which rely on the older CDMA network.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CY4Z8b"&gt;Dish Network issued a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission this week, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the urgent situation it faces if T-Mobile moves ahead with its planned January 2022 CDMA network shutdown. “We believe that T-Mobile’s actions raise significant competition and public interest concerns,” the letter states. It would be a blow to Dish’s business, but most importantly, millions of Boost Mobile customers would feel the impact as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWrRn"&gt;Boost Mobile, a former Sprint MVNO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632376/boost-mobile-sale-sprint-tmobile-merger-approval-promise"&gt;sold to Dish&lt;/a&gt; as part of T-Mobile’s acquisition, serves 9 million customers. According to the letter, more than half of them rely on CDMA service. Its prepaid service is an accessible alternative to contract plans for low-income customers; there’s no credit check required or even a credit card. Customers can pay for phones and service at retailers like Walmart and top them off as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y9BNlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1N4zX"&gt;It makes for an appealing service if the costs and contracts of major carrier plans are prohibitive, but it’s also what makes migrating these customers to a newer network uniquely challenging. Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company, and those still using slower 3G CDMA devices are likely doing so not because they prefer it, but because they can’t afford a new phone. In less than a year, they’ll be forced to choose between making that purchase or losing their current cell service altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9poK8v"&gt;Bearing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21207520/coronavirus-deaths-economy-layoffs-inequality-covid-pandemic"&gt;disproportionate effects of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and related economic fallout, it’s likely not a great time for these customers to be shopping for a new phone. Dish also points out that the global chip shortage makes it an especially bad time to try to secure a large number of new devices for customers. Overall, the company’s letter to the FCC makes quite clear how dire the situation is in its view: “A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible and will leave potentially millions of Boost subscribers disenfranchised and without cell service come January 1, 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4StEr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHOBXK"&gt;As part of the Sprint merger, T-Mobile agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;help set Dish up as the US’s fourth wireless carrier&lt;/a&gt;, and selling the prepaid Boost business to Dish was one step in that plan. However, in late 2020, T-Mobile notified Dish that it would be shutting down the CDMA network that many Boost customers use in early 2022, several years earlier than Dish had anticipated. It’s a move the company has been quick to call anti-competitive, both in &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/dish-chairman-calls-out-t-mobile-for-being-anticompetitive_id130387"&gt;previous communications&lt;/a&gt; and in this latest letter to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXfQq"&gt;T-Mobile doesn’t see things the same way. It isn’t technically violating the agreement by doing so, and in the company’s view, it has given Dish plenty of notice. Here’s what it had to say in a statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S0FHwM"&gt;Everything we are doing here is exactly consistent with the agreement that DISH made with us a year and a half ago, and we have been very proactive and transparent about the timing for this transition with all of our MVNOs, including DISH. We gave DISH notice in October 2020 for a January 1st 2022 transition – far more than the required 6-month contractual agreement. Our agreement with DISH is also clear that they are responsible for migrating Boost customers, just as we are responsible for migrating Sprint customers, and we are confident that DISH is already making plans to take good care of their impacted customers prior to the transition date. Given the advance notice that they received, just a small percentage of Boost customers should need to upgrade their handsets by the end of this year, and typically those customers would be supported with incentives and promotions to get their handsets upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tn11Sl"&gt;In fact, the company is taking a kind of victory lap on the anniversary of the acquisition with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fceo-mike-sievert-merger-year-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F2%2F22364126%2Fboost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the 5G network it’s been able to build with Sprint’s former spectrum. Based on the tone of this latest letter to the FCC, it’s a celebratory mood that Dish certainly doesn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Wifi router management is getting rolled into the Google Home app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8iCmdFMDu_u-YaNG2ibX8ANjX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068059/vpavic_191010_3722_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mDfRH"&gt;Google is killing off its dedicated Google Wifi app for managing its routers, rolling that functionality over to the Google Home app as the company continues to “help our customers control and manage all their connected products in one place and enable routines across them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZcjMu"&gt;The switchover to the Google Home app will come in two phases: first, Google will disable most of the functionality of the Google Wifi app on May 25th. Starting then, users will only be able to view the current status of their networks — but any changes, including adding new routers or access points — will have to be done in the Google Home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YQtF4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting on May 25th, users will have to use the Home app to make any changes to a Google Wifi setup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FoEx91"&gt;Then, sometime in June, Google will remove the Wifi app from the Play Store and iOS App Store, funneling all users to exclusively use the Google Home app. (It’ll also stop supporting the old app at that time for existing users, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkqFL1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9547597?p=wifi_migrate&amp;amp;utm_source=transactional&amp;amp;utm_medium=email_service&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GS106039&amp;amp;utm_term=learnmore1&amp;amp;utm_content=110398454&amp;amp;visit_id=637529843289028306-3069274133&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;Google points out&lt;/a&gt; that migrating existing Wifi setups to the Google Home app will offer some new benefits, including the ability to use Google Assistant for things like pausing the Wi-Fi connection, testing your current internet speed, and (in a neat bit of product synergy) showing a guest Wi-Fi password on a Google Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwLzNM"&gt;Migrating a network setup seems to be a relatively simple process, although Google’s how-to warns it’s a one-way street: once you switch over to the Google Home app, you can’t go back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered more cars than it made in the first quarter of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Tn8-FFNOwq2pJPmI3C-aPXFGxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067798/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z2zOwc"&gt;Tesla delivered nearly 185,000 cars in the first quarter of 2021, more than it produced over the three-month period, according to numbers &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q1-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;the company shared on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has been ramping up production capacity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;just nearly missed&lt;/a&gt; CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 cars in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlCEcl"&gt;Of the cars Tesla delivered in Q1 2021, nearly 183,000 were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, more than the 180,000 of those models produced in Q1. On top of the Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, the company also sold an additional 2,020 Model S cars that had been produced in previous quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HSzsIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla could beat last year’s 500,000-car goal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rzxpko"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced redesigns&lt;/a&gt; for the Model S and Model X in January 2021, which added new powertrains, higher range options, and the landscape in-car display from the more popular Model 3. Tesla says the redesigns were “exceptionally well-received” and that it’s in the early stage of ramping up production on both new models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzxUMr"&gt;The company didn’t break out specific delivery numbers for cars in China, but Tesla says it continues to be happy with the reception of its newer Model Y in the country. China has been a focus for Tesla since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042493/tesla-chinese-model-3-cars-gigafactory-3-shanghai"&gt;opened its Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt; there in 2019, which the company seems to see as critical for meeting demand for its cars. When Tesla shared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252765/tesla-profit-q4-2020-earnings-elon-musk-record-sales"&gt;its Q4 2020 financial figures&lt;/a&gt;, it announced that its factory in Shanghai could allow it to produce as many as 1.05 million cars in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbIBOy"&gt;Tesla and Musk haven’t yet announced any ambitious delivery goals for 2021, but in comparison to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205932/tesla-q1-sales-deliveries-production-china-factory-coronavirus"&gt;88,400 cars it delivered in Q1 2020,&lt;/a&gt; Tesla seems like it’s starting on the right foot to beat last year’s 500,000-car goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5aC67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in the iOS 14.5 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5, which is now in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;When you update your phone to iOS 14.5, you’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;prompted to pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. However, if you’ve changed your mind and want to use a different voice (or are using the 14.5 beta and weren’t prompted), this guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, it will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;This process is unlikely to change in the final version, but if it does, we’ll be sure to update this how-to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is getting a Bruno Mars emote</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InY9xi"&gt;Bruno Mars is the latest celebrity to jump into the virtual world of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Today, developer Epic Games announced that the battle royale game would be getting a new Mars emote — essentially an in-game dance — set to the singer’s song “Leave the Door Open.” Players will be able to buy it starting at 8PM ET tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaDZUz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is steadily becoming a place filled with real-world stars, whether it’s streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; or the upcoming appearance of Brazilian soccer star Neymar. Music, in particular, has been a big focal point for the game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; both held massive in-game concerts with millions of virtual attendees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448831/bts-fortnite-party-royale-dynamite-music-video"&gt;BTS debuted a music video&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;Epic even created its own soundstage&lt;/a&gt; to host shows from the likes of Dominic Fike, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21525028/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-jbalvin-concert"&gt;J Balvin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437843/fortnite-anderson-paak-spotlight-concert-date"&gt;Anderson .Paak&lt;/a&gt; (who recently performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbdJCk"&gt;Easter is on Sunday, and if you celebrate the holiday but won’t be able to visit your family this year, a Zoom call is a great substitute to ensure you can still connect with your loved ones. A few devices support Zoom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;including Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, which is on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="uhKwuI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GWOeX6"&gt;Amazon is also discounting its Fire HD 8 tablets, knocking $30 off the usual retail prices. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 tablet for only $60&lt;/a&gt;, or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 Plus for $80&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the previous Fire HD 8 models, the latest tablets have a USB-C port for faster charging, and the HD 8 Plus supports wireless charging, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O0hIwm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aWGA7h"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has discounted the Galaxy S21 line with up to $200 in savings.

  &lt;p id="6PbWml"&gt;Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are big business now, at least for the moment. Everything from one of &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/creepy-chan-allison-harvard"&gt;Creepy Chan&lt;/a&gt;’s first &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/AllisonHarvard/creepy-chan-16273"&gt;Myspace posts&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/technology/nft-sale.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; has been put up for sale. (The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;piece went for the Ether equivalent of $560,000.) But they weren’t always a  speculative, suspiciously scammy garden. In fact, according to Glitch CEO Anil Dash in a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/"&gt;new piece in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing started as a project kludged together for a hackathon that brought artists and technologists together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmytJh"&gt;It all started in May 2014, Dash writes, when he was paired up with the digital artist Kevin McCoy. “This was around the peak of Tumblr culture, when a raucous, wildly inspiring community of millions of artists and fans was sharing images and videos completely devoid of attribution, compensation, or context,” Dash writes. A solution to that problem became the seed of their idea. “By the wee hours of the night, McCoy and I had hacked together a first version of a blockchain-backed means of asserting ownership over an original digital work. Exhausted and a little loopy, we gave our creation an ironic name: monetized graphics.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqKGw1"&gt;Neither Dash nor McCoy patented the idea, though McCoy spent a few subsequent years evangelizing it. But they both envisioned their creation as a way to give artists more control over their work; that was always the thesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LNBU2f"&gt;Technology &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be enabling artists to exercise control over their work, to more easily sell it, to more strongly protect against others appropriating it without permission. By devising the technology specifically for artistic use, McCoy and I hoped we might prevent it from becoming yet another method of exploiting creative professionals. But nothing went the way it was supposed to. Our dream of empowering artists hasn’t yet come true, but it has yielded a lot of commercially exploitable hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dqQ6GX"&gt;Dash’s writing is lucid and clear on the implications of the technology and on NFTs as we currently know them. He’s also sharp on blockchain technology’s promises and limitations. Dash and McCoy’s “proto-NFTs” — as Dash refers to them later in the piece — are fascinating because they’re explicitly geared toward artists and are not necessarily so concerned with profits, unlike the NFT market we’ve got now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjytH0"&gt;The current NFT boom might be a fork in the road if enough people want it to be. We &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;use technology to benefit artists and compensate them for their work — we can take the path less traveled. The only question is: will we?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo CEO John Krafcik steps down, replaced by two co-CEOs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4rmGS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9321951/google-self-driving-car-new-ceo-john-krafcik"&gt;Waymo CEO John Krafcik&lt;/a&gt; has announced that he’ll be stepping down from his role as CEO. Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo’s chief operating officer, and Dmitri Dolgov, the company’s chief technology officer, will work jointly as co-CEOs going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JDnIp"&gt;Krafcik didn’t provide a detailed explanation for his departure or what he’s planning on doing next. “After five and a half exhilarating years leading this team, I’ve decided to depart from my CEO role with Waymo and kick-off new adventures. To start, I’m looking forward to a refresh period, reconnecting with old friends and family, and discovering new parts of the world,” he commented in a blog post announcing the move.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UMbUx__z3zcWELsZehdWNOxy-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416466/image__7_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z4mKt"&gt;In a statement to employees &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-steps-aside-as-co-ceos-take-over.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Mawakana and Dolgov said, “We’re committed to working alongside you to build, deploy and commercialize the Waymo driver and drive the success of our incredible team and this company. We’re energized by the road and opportunity ahead of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LiT01"&gt;Krafcik joined Waymo as its first CEO back in 2005, before it was its own branch of the company (or even before it was called Waymo), and he has led the division since. He’ll also be sticking around in at least some capacity as an adviser going forward. Before joining Waymo, Krafcik served as president and CEO of Hyundai’s American operations (in addition to a stint at automotive price comparison site TrueCar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiboFA"&gt;Waymo has come a long way since then: the company has been testing fully autonomous on-demand self-driving cars in Phoenix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126103/waymo-one-self-driving-taxi-service-ride-safety-alphabet-cost-app"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; through its Waymo One service (which it’s continued to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;ramp up in subsequent years&lt;/a&gt;). The company is also working on self-driving commercial trucks as part of its &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-via/"&gt;Waymo Via service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CDC says fully vaccinated people can travel safely in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="JFK International Airport As Air Travel Increases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QW-8S_OHSdxAAKP4zJ-oGtnI2Lo=/0x2:5000x3335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067355/1231950033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Travelers wearing protective masks walk past a sign pointing towards a Covid-19 testing location in Terminal 5 at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, U.S., on Friday, March 26, 2021. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWddHD"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated “can travel safely within the United States,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in new guidance issued today. Until now, the agency advised people to “delay” both domestic and international travel even if they had been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl2i3B"&gt;The CDC’s new recommendations also allow fully vaccinated travelers to avoid self-quarantine after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html"&gt;traveling domestically&lt;/a&gt;. They can also skip COVID-19 tests before and after a trip, unless their destination requires it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNS351"&gt;If traveling &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, fully vaccinated people will still need to be tested for COVID-19 before returning to the US and upon arrival. But they won’t be required to self-quarantine. “International travel poses additional risks and even fully vaccinated travelers are at increased risk for getting and possibly spreading new COVID-19 variants,” the CDC said in its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SjlUAN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syMUEr"&gt;The CDC also says fully vaccinated travelers should still wear a mask, wash their hands often, and maintain six feet of physical distance from other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3EZjf"&gt;Groups of fully vaccinated people can gather indoors without masks, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319514/vaccinated-people-vaccines-cdc-mask-coronavirus-social-guidelines"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month. A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second shot of the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine or two weeks after a single shot of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grNby"&gt;Even before the CDC made its announcement, airlines were already seeing an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/14/977019086/more-u-s-travelers-are-flying-again-despite-covid-19-risks"&gt;uptick&lt;/a&gt; in travel. By May, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/delta-air-lines-to-stop-blocking-middle-seats-on-may-1.html"&gt;all US carriers&lt;/a&gt; will sell tickets for middle seats on flights again. Delta was the last holdout until it &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/ready-set-lets-go-delta-gives-customers-more-ways-reclaim-joy-travel"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that it would end its policy of blocking those seats to limit the spread of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0J9CCL"&gt;The CDC, however, is still &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/03/29/covid-travel-should-avoided-cdc-continues-advise-trips-surge/7050320002/"&gt;concerned that holiday travel&lt;/a&gt; this weekend may contribute to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1377366856382693377"&gt;rising COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Public health experts are asking people to keep up COVID-19 precautions and get vaccinated in an attempt to stop a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22358095/covid-19-fourth-surge-wave-rochelle-walensky-cdc-impending-doom"&gt;fourth surge&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sealed Super Mario Bros. sells for $660,000, shattering record for most expensive game ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0lBu_0gEfjRkAa5xeSWFSCmxdY=/202x0:1660x972/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067337/mario_bros.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3D5o6F"&gt;A sealed copy of the NES classic &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; sold for an incredible $660,000 at Heritage Auctions on Friday, more than quadrupling the previous record for the most expensive game ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y56MAL"&gt;This isn’t the first time &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; has held the record: a mint copy of the US version of the game sold for $114,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt; (which broke the record of $100,150 set by &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18225317/mint-copy-super-mario-bros-100150-auction"&gt;in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;). In November, however, a different title set a new record: a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt; sold for $156,000, making it the most expensive video game ever sold until today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCTdLe"&gt;Here is what makes the version of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; that sold today so special, &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/super-mario-bros-wata-96-a-sealed-hangtab-1-code-mid-production-nes-nintendo-1985-usa/a/7242-93028.s?type=bidnotice-tracked-dailystatus"&gt;according to Heritage Auctions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NXJqIM"&gt;Not only is this the finest plastic-sealed copy with a perforated cardboard hangtab we’ve ever offered of any black box title, it is also the oldest sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; we’ve ever had the opportunity to offer. This is only the fourth version of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; ever produced, and its window of production was remarkably short. Just to paint a better picture of how short this really was — the nationwide release for the console came in mid to late 1986, and black box games distributed for that release did not have the “Game Pak NES-GP” code. It’s worth mentioning that Nintendo managed to add the trademark symbol to the Nintendo Entertainment System on their game boxes by the beginning of 1987. That certainly doesn’t leave much time at all for this variant to be produced in-between the two!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XslcEa"&gt;For more than half a million dollars, I hope the buyer finds it a worthy purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
