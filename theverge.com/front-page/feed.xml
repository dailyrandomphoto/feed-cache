    <title>OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s next company is literally called Nothing</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vfcHH"&gt;Carl Pei, the OnePlus co-founder who parted ways with the company last year, has announced the name of his next venture: Nothing. It describes itself as a “London based consumer technology company” and counts the likes of iPod inventor Tony Fadell, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, and YouTuber Casey Neistat as investors. It plans to release its first “smart devices” in the first half of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngvnGY"&gt;“Nothing’s mission is to remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future,” says Pei, Nothing’s founder and CEO, in a press release. “We believe that the best technology is beautiful, yet natural and intuitive to use. When sufficiently advanced, it should fade into the background and feel like nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7E7WAtfVMFyafAtcMcBZ9W5rrF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260889/DSCF6741.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carl Pei, who previously co-founded the smartphone brand OnePlus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9EbaVJ"&gt;What’s unclear at the moment is exactly what products Nothing plans to release. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; ahead of today’s announcement, Pei declined to offer specific details on what form Nothing’s first “smart devices” will take. He also declined to say which companies Nothing plans to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyeohh"&gt;Pei does confirm, however, that Nothing plans to release products across multiple categories, with the eventual aim of building up an ecosystem of devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMBfO1"&gt;“Right now... the team is being built, so we want to focus on simpler categories,” Pei says, “but as our team gains capabilities and skills we want to start moving up. The ultimate vision of having everything connected in a seamless way, that can only happen when you have multiple categories of products that are connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA1sQN"&gt;During Pei’s tenure at OnePlus, the company released everything from smartphones to headphones and even TVs. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/carl-pei-oneplus-next-project"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pei’s new company could focus on music and might include manufacturing headphones. When asked, Pei declined to confirm whether headphones would be among Nothing’s early products. When asked by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, he said the company’s plans were “so much more than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pieozJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A completely independent company owned by our founding team and our investors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ENq0FL"&gt;While there’s been speculation that this could point toward Nothing developing an accompanying music service, Pei tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Nothing plans to make most of its money by selling hardware rather than software subscriptions, at least initially. “We haven’t spent too much time thinking about the software portion of it,” Pei says. “It definitely needs to be a good user experience if you are to generate revenue from software.” In the long term, however, he admits that a “healthy business” requires both good hardware and good software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCyxhI"&gt;Pei’s new company plans to differentiate itself by using “custom made” components in its products right from the start. Pei suggests this will stop Nothing’s products from looking too much like its competitors. “There’s a reason why a lot of products on the market look quite similar,” Pei observes. “It’s because they share a lot of the same components and the same building blocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9m0ZCD"&gt;In contrast, OnePlus’ phones have faced frequent criticism over the years for the similarities they’ve shared with Oppo’s phones. In a recent video, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9EOAEWC9hJ4?t=221"&gt;Marques Brownlee outlined&lt;/a&gt; a series of Oppo and OnePlus devices with strikingly similar hardware, like the OnePlus 5 and Oppo R11, the OnePlus 6T and Oppo R17, and the OnePlus Nord N100 and Oppo A53. The two brands even use similar fast-charging technologies. OnePlus has Dash Charge, and Oppo has VOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEJF1q"&gt;While OnePlus and Oppo are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; to exist under the same Chinese corporate giant BBK Electronics, Pei says Nothing is unencumbered by such an arrangement. “[Nothing is] a completely independent company owned by our founding team and our investors,” says Pei, with its own R&amp;amp;D department. And despite using contract manufacturers to build its devices, Pei says Nothing won’t just “relabel somebody else’s products.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz8pyT"&gt;But while Pei hopes Nothing’s early products will feature “differentiated” designs without feeling “different for the sake of being different,” the eventual hope is for them to fade into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlF5RU"&gt;“I kind of envision a grass field with people having a picnic and there’s no screen, there’s no laptop screen, there’s no phone screen, there’s no smartwatch screen, there’s no billboard screen,” Pei muses. “That’s kind of the end state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMnQb5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; columnist Walt Mossberg referred this future state as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15686870/walt-mossberg-final-column-the-disappearing-computer"&gt;ambient computing&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Pei admits that it may take 20 or 30 years to arrive, but he says the future his company is aiming for is one where its technology resembles… well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Watch 3’s EKG feature is coming to 31 new countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWYcTEqvRCXr3PJkU6QsZeu_8Lo=/0x0:5417x3611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68725515/dseifert_200811_4139_0019.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZWu26"&gt;Samsung is expanding its Health Monitor app &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-vital-blood-pressure-and-electrocardiogram-tracking-to-galaxy-watch3-and-galaxy-watch-active2-in-31-more-countries"&gt;to 31 new countries&lt;/a&gt;, including 28 European countries, and people in those countries will be able to use the app with a Galaxy Watch 3 or Galaxy Active 2 smartwatch to take electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPWDVS"&gt;Samsung says the app was granted a CE marking in December, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking"&gt;which means&lt;/a&gt; that it complies with applicable regulations in Europe and can be offered in the European Economic Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NN2zhG"&gt;Here is the full list of countries in Europe that will soon be able to get the app: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. It will also be available in Chile, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCH23I"&gt;To be able to take an EKG or blood pressure measurement, you’ll need to have the Samsung Health Monitor app installed on your Galaxy smartphone and on a Galaxy Watch 3 or Galaxy Active 2. Samsung says the app update that enables the features will begin rolling out on February 4th, though the company notes that availability “may vary by market and carrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYM64j"&gt;Apple introduced the ability to take an EKG with the Apple Watch Series 4 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128209/apple-watch-electrocardiogram-ecg-irregular-heart-rate-features-available-health-monitor"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though Apple Watches still can’t natively track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI is now selling a warranty to replace your drone if it flies away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJXdKmFCdr_5kBlFUYQwZQEJVNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68725387/vpavic_042029_4003_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRihfv"&gt;DJI is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fguides%2Fdji-care-refresh-flyaway-coverage%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook_organic%26utm_campaign%3DBG-2021%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26fbclid%3DIwAR2nek-sMLJ1LF9GEnrjsl-Qr3VUBaP3pxNK5Vhh4fH_Mi9tFkpYPlz5Aic&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now offering flyaway coverage&lt;/a&gt; for its Mini 2 and Mavic Air 2 drones, should they develop a mind of their own and take off. The cost of replacing the escaped drone is $225 for the Mini, and $399 for the Mavic, which is on top of the price of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fservice%2Fdjicare-refresh%2Finfo%23faq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI’s Care Refresh extended warranty&lt;/a&gt;. For that, you’ll pay $50 for the Mini, and $80 for the Mavic. If you already own one of these drones and the extended warranty, you’re eligible for flyway replacements going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zX7E1f"&gt;The extended warranty also lets you replace your drone if you damage it, twice per year, for $50 each. For flyaway coverage, there’s a one-time limit — if your replacement also goes AWOL, you’ll be on the hook to replace it, though there is a two-year version of the warranty that costs more and covers three accidents and two flyaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4ef1P"&gt;At half the price of a new drone, the replacement costs are rather high compared to something like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fproducts%2Fiphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AppleCare Plus with Theft and Loss&lt;/a&gt;, which only charges $149 to replace a lost or stolen iPhone. DJI’s coverage doesn’t cover you if your drone gets lost or stolen, only if it’s taken by the sky, but it also costs less to start: adding Theft and Loss coverage to an iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/13/iphone-12-iphone-12-mini-applecare-costs-149-199-for-iphone-12-pro-models"&gt;is $219, or $269 for an iPhone 12 Pro, for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSF3R6"&gt;Of course, you would hope that the drones would simply not fly away on their own in the first place. On the announcement page, DJI says that “some accidents are inevitable when flying in complex environments, or in locations with signal interference, strong winds, or obstructed views.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;If I were buying an expensive drone, I would hope that it would know what to do in most of those situations (though wind does seem like a valid factor in a flyaway event.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jNVxP"&gt;It seems like DJI has made progress in this regard, though — Googling “drone flyaway” brings up several stories from 2018 and before, but they seem to be less frequent nowadays. Still, if you’re worried about losing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;your nice drone&lt;/a&gt;, it’s good to have more options, should it ever decide to slip the surly bonds of Earth to visit the great drone factory in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bloodhound’s 1,000 mph rocket car being sold for $11 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rWlzPUyAUXb_2FmuA1SruT0F7aU=/491x0:5795x3536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724921/BLOODHOUND_LSR_Charlie_Sperring__IMGL5805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bloodhound LSR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPOhpa"&gt;For sale: a rocket-powered car named Bloodhound built specifically to break the land speed record. Theoretical top speed of 1,000 miles per hour. Seats one. Price? A paltry $11 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6eobx"&gt;The tortured saga of the Bloodhound Land Speed Record project has reached a sadly predictable impasse: the current owner is done spending money trying to set a new record after saving the project from bankruptcy in 2018. It’s hard to blame him. The Bloodhound program has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9384963/bloodhound-ssc-supersonic-rocket-car-photos"&gt;been going for the better part of a decade at this point&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to break the 763 mile-per-hour record, let alone scratch at the group’s ultimate stated goal of 1,000 miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvZDUi"&gt;The Bloodhound still needs the actual rocket in order to make its full-speed runs, too, despite hitting 628 miles per hour in a late-2019 test. (It’s currently jet engine powered.) The pandemic killed the project’s momentum, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1hgKR"&gt;“Work now needs to restart in the next few months to get ready for a 2022 record attempt,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloodhoundlsr.com/800-mph-bloodhound-lsr-project-for-sale/"&gt;a blog post on the Bloodhound website reads&lt;/a&gt;. “The alternative would be to put the car into long-term storage, with no certainty of being able to restart the project. As the prospect of a post-Covid world beckons, the Bloodhound team now needs to find a new owner to continue its ‘engineering adventure’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtV9SW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$11 million is a lot of money, but it’s also not? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBgqzv"&gt;Don’t get me wrong — $11 million is a lot of money to most people. But in many parts of the economy right now, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-jerome-powell-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-db97a4aeb224f3f8e7fa85a9e0bd7fb1"&gt;money is nearly free&lt;/a&gt;. In the last half-year alone, for example, billions of dollars have been thrown at unproven automotive startups that have no chance of turning a profit anytime soon, thanks to the boom in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;mergers with special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;, or SPACs. Why not a rocket car? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu8S0r"&gt;Bloodhound argues buyers could recoup their investment as long as a record attempt happens. The Bloodhound team says there is “significant” fundraising potential “as the record attempt gets closer” and that selling sponsorships and rights could generate cash in the short term. Perhaps there’s a SPAC out there willing to test this claim &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-bubble-may-burstand-not-a-day-too-soon-11609975529"&gt;before the inevitable SPAClash arrives&lt;/a&gt;? Or maybe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/billionaire-wealth-inequality-poverty/index.html"&gt;the growing billionaire class would like to pitch in&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbbrCm"&gt;The gang behind the Bloodhound has a ways to go to beat the land speed record, but the project has been through so much that it’s hard to imagine things ending here. Scraping together another $11 million could be tricky, but it’s easier — and certainly less physically risky — than finding those last few hundred miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Game Pass subscribers hit 18 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HmwHNtqDGSFMRSosE9FjBFqegiI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724877/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NdMGg0"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to attract people to its Xbox Game Pass service. The “Netflix for video games” service now has 18 million subscribers, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth"&gt;15 million previously reported&lt;/a&gt; in September. Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that offers access to a growing selection of more than 100 Xbox games for $9.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zf9Wte"&gt;Microsoft has been pushing Xbox Game Pass for more than a year now, and it’s clear the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;heavily invested in its future&lt;/a&gt;. Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; title appeared on Xbox Game Pass late last year, and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;is also available on the service for both Xbox and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eg1sj4"&gt;On an earnings call today, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also revealed that Xbox Live has more than 100 million monthly active users. Nadella also said the launch of the Xbox Series X and S was the most successful in Microsoft’s history, with “the most devices ever sold in a launch month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61R5e"&gt;Microsoft also appears to be focused on studio acquisitions to bolster the content available on Game Pass. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/"&gt;ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt; acquisition, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; studio Bethesda Softworks, is a big deal that will boost Xbox Game Pass in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A3ZXIT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Game Pass briefly explained: console, PC, xCloud streaming and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"},{"title":"Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v8PI9f"&gt;There have also been a variety of promotions designed to entice consumers into Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft regularly offers the first month of the service for $1 and has been incentivizing Xbox Live Gold customers to switch over to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the company’s new xCloud game streaming feature. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also now get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556384/xbox-game-pass-disney-plus-subscription-free-perk"&gt;a month of Disney Plus for free&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uwo263"&gt;Controversially, Microsoft recently planned to increase its Xbox Live Gold cost in a move that was widely interpreted as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244468/microsoft-xbox-live-price-increase"&gt;effort to push people into Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;quick to reverse its decision&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox Live Gold prices will remain the same for now. Free-to-play games will also no longer require an Xbox Live Gold subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweetbot 6 brings essential updates and a monthly subscription to the iPhone’s best Twitter app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqMbUIokFDhxVQu7cRbqDIasj7I=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724797/tweetbot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiOYrW"&gt;Tweetbot has long been one of the best third-party Twitter applications around for the iPhone and Mac, and today sees the launch of the latest version for iOS: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834"&gt;Tweetbot 6&lt;/a&gt;, which converts the app into a paid subscription service instead of the single-time purchase that was previously offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7"&gt;The new app makes the change to &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access"&gt;Twitter’s new API&lt;/a&gt; that the company introduced last summer, enabling some long-missing features in the premium Twitter app like Twitter cards and polls. That change does come with some trade-offs, though, including the removal of user-selected options for URL shortening, image uploads, and video uploads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0OcxaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter launches new API as it tries to make amends with third-party developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Rb0hGa"&gt;The free version of the app offers some basic functionality in allowing users to view Twitter — but you’ll have to pay for more substantial features, including the ability to send or reply to tweets, along with support for multiple accounts, push notifications, and “advanced filtering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgwxoH"&gt;Existing users may find the update to be a bit frustrating, given that Tweetbot 5 had previously been a single-time purchase for $4.99. At $0.99 per month (or a discounted $5.99 per year), the new app marks a price increase no matter how you look at things, while offering only a handful of new features to make up the difference. Furthermore, Tapbots will soon stop selling Tweetbot 5 on the App Store (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992"&gt;developer Paul Haddad&lt;/a&gt; says Apple made that a requirement to approve the new version), so new users soon won’t have the choice to buy the outdated older version for a single-time payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbLEJq"&gt;Tapbots does note on its website that the new version of Tweetbot 6 is an “early access” version of the app, with “many new features on our roadmap to be built as well as new API’s to adopt as Twitter makes them available,” so it’s possible that the new app will get further functionality over time that may ease the bitter pill of the pricer subscription change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRmNnI"&gt;The company also has yet to announce any upgrade plans for the Mac version of Tweetbot, which currently uses the older Twitter API and still costs $9.99 upfront to use. Including an updated macOS version of Tweetbot in that monthly or yearly subscription could also help add value to the new subscription, a strategy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"&gt;other apps like Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; have employed in their own jumps from paid apps to ongoing subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s VR painting app is getting the axe, but it will live on as an open-source project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrKOLdCmEgIYFvgIAr7ku_9-XnU=/193x0:2563x1580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724785/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_1.41.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SPPTIk"&gt;Google is ending development on the virtual reality painting app Tilt Brush — one of the most well-known VR applications — and &lt;a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/01/the-future-of-tilt-brush.html"&gt;making it open source&lt;/a&gt;. Tilt Brush was &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/google-acquires-tilt-brush-developer-and-thrive-audio-to-add-to-vr-team/"&gt;acquired by Google in 2015&lt;/a&gt; after launching for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, and it was soon folded into the company’s larger VR plans, like its Google Cardboard and Daydream headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRLgrX"&gt;Tilt Brush’s main feature is three-dimensional painting in VR, but the app received interesting updates over its tenure at Google, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/30/13122502/tilt-brush-getting-multiplayer-mode-google-virtual-reality"&gt;multiplayer support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/20/14340346/google-open-source-tilt-brush-toolkit-unity-integration"&gt;an open-source toolkit&lt;/a&gt; that offered the ability to export Tilt Brush drawings for use in animation. With this latest announcement, that development is coming to an end, and future support of Tilt Brush is in the hands of the community that still uses it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRWpao"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TckqNdrdbgk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tWlMI2"&gt;Tilt Brush’s code can be accessed &lt;a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush"&gt;on GitHub now&lt;/a&gt;, but Google says some features had to be removed from the open-source release because of licensing restrictions. Should you want to try your hand at tinkering with open-source Tilt Brush, the company is &lt;a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush/blob/master/README.md"&gt;providing detailed instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to rebuild those missing features in the app. Additionally, Tilt Brush will still be available to download on all of the major VR app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPY2on"&gt;Tilt Brush is just the latest in a series of discontinued Google VR projects. Daydream VR headsets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915609/google-pixel-4-no-daydream-support-view-vr-headset-discontinued"&gt;were discontinued around the launch of the Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cardboard received a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952495/google-cardboard-open-source-phone-based-vr-daydream"&gt;open-source send-off in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-jump-shutting-down-1203219306/"&gt;Jump camera and video service&lt;/a&gt; were 86’ed that same year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564279/google-expeditions-vr-cardboard-tours-shutdown-arts-culture-app-migration"&gt;VR field trip software Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; rode off into the sunset in 2020. Its surviving projects include VR versions of YouTube and Google Earth, as well as game development studio Owlchemy Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAFI97"&gt;Google and Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;are no strangers to killing off former darlings&lt;/a&gt; and other people’s current ones. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243484/alphabet-google-shutting-down-loon-internet-balloon-company-x"&gt;Look no further than Loon&lt;/a&gt; for an odd and exciting project that was recently ended.) But shifting things to open source seems like a meaningful compromise for the people who still use these products every day. Without Google resources, whatever’s next for Tilt Brush will still be a ways off, but it’s nice that the graveyard was spared a new headstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mUhzQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon plans to almost double its mmWave 5G coverage this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S_z-943QoZMKipjS9DfyurWuSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724737/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon has big 5G plans for 2021 after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, and close to the top of its list of priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage. That flavor of 5G is currently restricted to select areas within select cities in the US, and it’s highly dependent on your proximity to a Verizon 5G site due to the inherent technology that powers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAXx2l"&gt;Marketed under the name 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW), this variety of 5G is the type with high speeds but poor coverage, meaning Verizon has its work cut out for it expanding network coverage in 2021. But in its earnings report on Tuesday, the company says it plans to nearly double its 5G UW network this year by adding more than 14,000 new “sites.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTwSLpH9BVUiqBPrnScnMu687I8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261470/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_4.27.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="baqSU8"&gt;Now, it’s kind of ambiguous what a “site” means. Adding a 5G UW site sounds, in theory, like a way to expand the coverage area of the service, or at the very least to improve the connection strength in an existing area of coverage, considering mmWave tech relies on rigging up networks of antennas, power supplies, and other equipment to help boost range and blanket areas that are, right now, only served by slower and farther-reaching standard LTE and low-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjuCUF"&gt;Some of that equipment is apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249058/5g-cellular-equipment-houston"&gt;already showing up unannounced on the lawns of Houston residents&lt;/a&gt; who don’t really have a say in whether their slice of county-owned yard has to play host to these “ground fixtures” the size of chest cooler. Yet, it’s not clear if Verizon plans to add test sites primarily to improve the range and consistency of the network in existing markets, to bring coverage to new ones entirely, or a mix of both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZAxTn"&gt;That said, Verizon is, in effect, claiming it will double its coverage area to 30,000 sites by the end of the year. The company also says it plans to add 20 cities to its 5G UW coverage list, as well as 20-plus cities for its in-home 5G internet service. Presumably, that will be done through the site expansion to some degree. As of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/verizon-hits-60-city-goal-with-4-new-super-fast-5g-cities#:~:text=Verizon%20today%20hit%20the%2060,%22%20millimeter%2Dwave%205G%20network."&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon surpassed its 60-city milestone for its 5G UW network, and earlier this week, it announced that prepaid customers can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248705/verizon-prepaid-5g-uw"&gt;begin accessing its 5G UW network&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pXkqlc0OvDk0g7hBZCuu9w90gg=/77x0:902x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724657/dg1_3d_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus’ first Intel Iris Xe graphics card.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y1Kkof"&gt;Intel is launching its first Iris Xe desktop graphics cards today. Originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058422/intel-dg1-discrete-gpu-graphics-card-announcement-ces-2020"&gt;codenamed “DG1,”&lt;/a&gt; these new desktop GPUs are primarily aimed at small- and medium-sized businesses and mainstream desktop PCs. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/articles/intel-releases-iris-xe-desktop-graphics-cards/"&gt;Intel is teaming up&lt;/a&gt; with Asus and other partners to sell these cards to system integrators who will bundle them with prebuilt systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zewGOa"&gt;Much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21542700/intel-iris-ex-max-discrete-graphics-gpu"&gt;Iris Xe Max graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; that debuted in laptops back in October, these desktop GPUs aren’t really designed for gaming. Intel is marketing them as a way to improve what’s offered on mainstream desktop PCs, with better graphics, multi-display support, and improved hardware acceleration for certain codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lr3mQOR1-xOcQ4iMeNO71iZld4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261498/colorful_2_fan_dg1_angle_1_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel is working with other partners on these cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wOA5Qu"&gt;The cards will include three 4K display outputs for multiple monitors, alongside HDR support and AI capabilities. They will also support decoding AV1 content and ship with 4GB of video memory and 80 execution units. Intel is even offering Adaptive Sync support, so you’ll get a much smoother experience with higher refresh rate monitors with these cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhKvMM"&gt;While these initial cards aren’t designed to compete with Nvidia and AMD’s latest and greatest for gaming, Intel is also working on its Xe-HPG architecture. This promises to be focused on high-performance gaming tasks, and it could usher in an era of Intel competing with both AMD and Nvidia later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAS2df"&gt;The Iris Xe isn’t Intel’s first attempt at a desktop GPU, either. Intel killed off its Larrabee project &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel/intel-scraps-graphics-chip-based-on-larrabee-idUSTRE5B51QR20091206?type=technologyNews"&gt;10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it also launched its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel740"&gt;Intel i740 series&lt;/a&gt; all the way back in 1998. This is the first time in 20 years we’ve seen Intel launch a desktop GPU, but you’ll need to wait a little longer yet to see if Intel can truly take on Nvidia and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
