    <title>Old Vidme embeds turn into a hub of porn after domain purchase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJzCgz1b-dDTcKKhlhWYXXQoYXw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619819/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3qmfo"&gt;Here’s (yet another) argument against using third-party embeds on your respectable website: Porn company 5 Star HD Porn bought the expired domain for video hosting site Vidme, which went &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/vidme-shuts-down-video-app-1202628367/"&gt;out of business in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any websites with Vidme embeds now have porn on them. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xz3/a-defunct-video-hosting-site-is-flooding-normal-websites-with-hardcore-porn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported the story first, the list of websites with unexpected porn embeds includes &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine, &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;, and others. And yes, we discovered one such embed on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and have since disabled it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oEWMi18UCa2C2f0qY50bA1pJEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734411/bad_vid_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Old Vidme embeds now redirect to a porn site&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wx179d"&gt;It’s a very extreme example of link rot, which is what happens when online content or images are deleted or otherwise broken, so the links don’t point back to their original targets. We saw another widespread example of this after former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;President Trump was banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January after inciting a riot at the Capitol. The thousands of tweets the former president sent out over the years he was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts"&gt;Twitter were wiped out,&lt;/a&gt; and any embeds of the tweets now display as empty gray boxes. Some of the former president’s tweets must be preserved under the Presidential Records Act (which predates Twitter by more than four decades), and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;sortable archive of most of his tweets&lt;/a&gt; built by an independent developer, so his tweets haven’t totally disappeared from the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNih4t"&gt;Most social media platforms have enabled embeds of their content; Twitter activated embeds in 2012, and Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram all allow some version of embeds as well. Reddit has an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/embeds"&gt;option&lt;/a&gt; on its embedded content which allows users to have them blanked out if the post is edited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnlGj"&gt;Used correctly, embedded content can help illustrate a blog post or news item online, and provide a layer of credibility. But when links go bad, as they apparently have in the Vidme case, it can be a serious headache to deal with thousands of embeds that don’t go where they’re supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D24psI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel teases plan to speed up chip advancements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vy7C82epLts_0TD0z7wywMN8hJ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619549/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhlqpd"&gt;Intel has struggled recently with getting its more advanced chip architectures out the door, but that might be changing soon. CEO Pat Gelsinger announced today on Intel’s Q2 earnings call that “7nm is progressing well,” and the company is gearing up to announce news on how its “accelerating its annual cadence of innovation with new advancements in semiconductor process and packaging,” at a webcast on Monday, July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWrSVm"&gt;The announcement comes alongside &lt;a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_dc76b93ec01daad27a346504a3ae6e82/intel/db/887/8685/earnings_presentation/Q2_2021_Earnings_Presentation.pdf"&gt;Intel’s Q2 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, where the semiconductor company &lt;a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_dc76b93ec01daad27a346504a3ae6e82/intel/news/2021-07-22_Intel_Reports_Second_Quarter_2021_Financial_1485.pdf"&gt;managed to beat expectations&lt;/a&gt; and bring in $18.2 billion in revenue, up 2 percent year-over-year. Intel is feeling pretty optimistic about the future, too. It raised its 2021 outlook by an additional $1 billion to $73.5 billion, and now expects to achieve revenue growth year-over-year compared to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iN6xzD"&gt;Intel’s earnings have been trending upwards for the past several quarters, despite its frequent delays and misses on production of both its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/27/17291040/intel-10nm-cannon-lake-chips-delayed-2019-cpu-processor"&gt;10nm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;7nm chips&lt;/a&gt;. That growth has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;buoyed by spikes in demand&lt;/a&gt; for both personal computers and data-center chips in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw millions buy new laptops and computers to aid in remote work and education and an increased reliance on cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uE4vV"&gt;And Intel seems to still be riding that wave, recording $10.1 billion in revenue for its client computing group (up 6 percent year over year, and a Q2 record for the company), despite the global semiconductor shortage. Gelsinger commented during the call that he “expect[s] the shortages to bottom out in the second half [of the year, but] it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgrIkI"&gt;The boost for the client computing group also helped Intel make up for slower revenue from its data center group, which was down 9 percent year-over-year with $6.5 billion in revenue. There’s signs that that the impressive growth for the PC segment is starting to slow, however: both IDC and Gartner noted that growth of PC sales has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;slowed down considerably in Q2&lt;/a&gt;, which could indicate that the boost in sales there will diminish in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KrCX0F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s next-gen 7nm chips are delayed until at least 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"},{"title":"Intel’s hardware chief is leaving the company","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"},{"title":"Intel is replacing its CEO, Bob Swan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDE9Oi"&gt;The past year has been a tumultuous one for Intel. Last summer, the company was forced to admit that it would be severely delaying its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;upcoming 7nm architecture&lt;/a&gt; for its next generation of processors. That news was followed by the departure of the company’s hardware chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"&gt;Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;replacement of CEO Bob Swan&lt;/a&gt; with Pat Gelsinger (a former chief technology office and hardware engineer at the company) in an attempt to right the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUyXox"&gt;Gelsinger has wasted no time in trying to establish changes to get Intel back on track, announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;new “IDM 2.0” initiative&lt;/a&gt; in March that aims to see Intel return as an industry leader in chip manufacturing. As part of that plan, the company will be outsourcing production for “products at the core of Intel’s computing offerings” to competitors like TSMC and Samsung starting in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVjCCG"&gt;Intel is also working to launch a new branch of its business, Intel Foundry Services, which will see the company take on manufacturing projects for third-party companies, including a $20 billion investment in expanding its manufacturing facilities in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycv9uy"&gt;Given the overwhelming demand for more chip making companies in light of the global semiconductor shortage, Intel Foundry Services could be a big win for the company down the line. Intel announced today that it has over 100 potential customers interested in the service, and promised more news on Monday about the new initiative, but it’ll still be some time before that business ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s G100 midrange battery champ is now available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_32l8T3w0dnMhLeTfkXSnc6SLY=/0x53:1250x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619427/motog100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G100 offers respectable midrange specs like 5G and a Snapdragon 870 processor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWa3Uk"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g100%2Fp%3FskuId%3D627&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22589232%2Fmotorola-moto-g100-price-specs-screen-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now selling the Moto G100 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;introducing it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for Latin American and European markets. It comes with midrange specs like a big 5,000mAh battery, 5G, and a 90Hz screen for a $599 MSRP. From now until August 5th, Motorola is offering a $100 discount off the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wLWt"&gt;There are two important footnotes on the G100’s US carrier compatibility: it’s a GSM-only phone, so will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile but not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Outside of that, it appears to be a respectable midrange device, if priced a little on the high end. It uses a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB of RAM, sub-6GHz 5G, and a 6.7-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Wz7"&gt;Motorola’s US phone releases this year have been concentrated around the $200-400 range, making G100 one of the pricier devices the company has introduced stateside recently. While a big battery, faster-refreshing screen, and a higher-tier processor feel fitting of its $599 price tag, its lack of IP-rating and broad carrier / 5G support could set it back against similarly priced peers like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (if you can still find one).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corning’s new Gorilla Glass protects smartphone camera lenses and lets in more light</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xah9S1vZYGRDEGm9CqBSMH5FeeM=/128x0:1223x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619421/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.03.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Corning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZGMF2"&gt;Corning &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html"&gt;has announced a new set of glass composites&lt;/a&gt; to protect the ever-growing number of camera lenses on the back of smartphones and capture more ambient light in the process. The new composites, called Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+, offer “advanced optical performance, superior scratch resistance, and durability” according to Corning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsdd4e"&gt;Technically, this DX variety of composite isn’t entirely new, Corning offered a version of &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/07/19/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-smartwatch/"&gt;Gorilla Glass with DX / DX+ for smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2018. But Corning says making the switch to smartphone camera lens covers added additional challenges because the glass needed to be more scratch-resistant and somehow let in more light, two qualities that can be at odds. Corning breaks down how it achieved both improvements in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45Ltmf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olO8scCNMu0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor20n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/corning-gorilla-glass-dx-for-phone-camera-lenses/"&gt;Corning tells &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Gorilla Glass with DX and Gorilla Glass with DX+ let in 98 percent of ambient light while still being just as scratch resistant as typical Gorilla Glass. In comparison, Corning claims lens covers with traditional anti-reflective coatings only let in about 95 percent of light. Maximizing the amount of light smartphones can gather while cutting down on reflections and glare is helpful for squeezing better performance out of smartphone cameras. It might also provide more information for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18203363/ai-artificial-intelligence-photography-google-photos-apple-huawei"&gt;the variety of computational processes&lt;/a&gt; that are now the norm in smartphone photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAhjZe"&gt;The company hasn’t announced what phones will feature the new glass composites, but Corning does say that Samsung is signed on as the first company to use the new Gorilla Glass camera lens covers. Given the Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung has scheduled for August 11th&lt;/a&gt; quickly approaching on the horizon, maybe we’ll see the glass in action sooner than we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is growing faster than it has in years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJ1Fv3XqsV7FqoeTZ2W4shug8Ns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619144/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MSapWP"&gt;Just a couple of years ago, there were concerns that Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, wouldn’t survive as a standalone company. Its stock price bottomed out around $5 after a disastrous redesign that slowed user growth and confused advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz5Hus"&gt;The situation is much different now. Snapchat is growing faster than it has since 2017, the year it went public. On Thursday, the camera-based messaging app said it added 13 million daily users during the second quarter, a 23 percent increase from the year-ago period. That means 293 million people use Snapchat every day around the world, up from 173 million this time four years ago. (Twitter reported 206 million daily users in the second quarter, by comparison.) Snap’s revenue also soared 116 percent to $982 million, making it a faster growing business than Twitter or Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jabOIH"&gt;The new numbers solidify one of the most impressive turnaround stories in tech. They also reflect how tech companies have benefited throughout the pandemic as people increasingly spend more time online. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has said he expects the app’s user base to actually grow faster as pandemic lockdowns end, since Snapchat is designed to be used out and about with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXJypj"&gt;Most of Snap’s user growth in the second quarter came from outside its core markets of North America and Europe, where advertisers pay more to reach people. That means Snap has lots of work ahead to monetize its new users effectively. This quarter’s results also benefitted from a delayed rollout of Apple’s changes to data tracking in iOS 14, which makes third-party developers show a prompt asking permission to track users across different apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFfbR5"&gt;Snap and other ad-driven businesses use this tracking to cheaply target ads, and there have been concerns that users saying no to the prompt will make it harder to tailor ads to peoples’ interests. In prepared remarks to investors, Snap’s chief business officer, Jeremi Gorman, said “we observed higher opt-in rates than we are seeing reported generally across the industry, which we believe is due in part to the trust our community has in our products and our business.” That indicates Snap may fare better than some of its peers, namely Facebook, in navigating Apple’s changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eYOAhP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What Snap and Facebook have in common is a passion for augmented reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbKGIZ"&gt;What Snap and Facebook have in common is a passion for augmented reality, the technology that overlays computer graphics over the real world through phone screens or smart glasses. Spiegel has been touting Snap’s investments in AR for years, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583827/snap-vertebrae-snapchat-ar-shopping-startup-3d-assets"&gt;the company has made moves&lt;/a&gt; to build shopping features that could eventually let anyone scan a product with the Snapchat camera, virtually experience it, and buy it without leaving the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xg9bi5"&gt;Snap recently debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;new Spectacles glasses with AR displays&lt;/a&gt;, though the they are only available for select AR creators. “More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community,” Spiegel said in his remarks to investors Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Olympics - Previews - Day -1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-pwcHIvMJ84WZGauN3ihON8brE=/0x0:4757x3171/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619046/1329977021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mdvOwt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/"&gt;2020 Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; are set to begin this week in Tokyo, with the opening ceremony kicking off Friday, July 23rd. While NBC and its streaming sibling Peacock will both carry coverage of the Games in the US, the Olympics will be streamable on other services as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44ruPV"&gt;Because it begins at 8PM in Japan, live coverage of the opening ceremony will start at 6:55AM ET / 3:55AM PT in the US. It will be broadcasted live on NBC as well as streamed live on the NBC Sports app and the &lt;a href="https://stream.nbcolympics.com/nbc-primetime-opening-ceremony"&gt;NBC Olympics&lt;/a&gt; website. NBC’s website has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/how-watch-opening-ceremony-tokyo-olympic-games"&gt;a full schedule of additional broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; of the event. A spokesperson for Peacock told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the opening ceremony will not air on the streaming service, however it will carry the closing ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2yTTr"&gt;Taking place July 23rd through August 8th, the Olympic Games will be streamed for free on Peacock, with one exception: US men’s basketball live coverage will require a premium subscription to the service. (Peacock Premium costs $5 per month, while going ad-free costs $10 per month.) A spokesperson for Peacock told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that US men’s basketball games prior to the final game will be available exclusively on streaming services, including on Peacock, before a later broadcast on NBC. All games will be available to stream on-demand on Peacock after they are televised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TORHMc"&gt;Aside from its live coverage, Peacock has a designated &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/828265/11640?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fwatch%2F2020-tokyo-olympics&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Olympics hub&lt;/a&gt; with plenty of pregames programming. The service will feature original programming, event replays, live coverage, and highlights from NBC coverage as well. NBC is the exclusive media rights holder for the Olympics in the US, so one way or another, watching the Games involves getting access to NBC content. The upside is there are quite a few ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HyrUcK"&gt;What time does the Olympics opening ceremony start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVazEL"&gt;Eastern Time: 6:55AM – 11AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVTikr"&gt;Central Time: 5:55AM – 10AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJHfCT"&gt;Pacific Time: 3:55AM – 8AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2bXOag"&gt;How to watch the Olympics opening ceremony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bYfDZm"&gt;Cable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sLrovR"&gt;USA Network, CNBC, NBCSN, Olympic Channel, Golf Channel, and Telemundo will each carry coverage of the Olympic Games, however NBC Sports Digital will be the premier destination for all sporting events and ceremonies. For a full list of which networks will broadcast which sports and metal events, head to &lt;a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/06/07/nbc-olympics-coverage-tokyo-broadcast-programming/"&gt;NBC Sports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zU0ySp"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CmY76B"&gt;Hulu’s live TV streaming service will give its users access to 7,000 hours of programming through NBC channels, including live and on-demand content and highlights of the Games. The service will also include a “tastepicker” feature for users to select their favorite sports and personalize their Olympics coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ppTaj"&gt;Hulu with Live TV costs $65 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v5vDQP"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1QBY6I"&gt;YouTube TV will stream the Olympic Games across its supported NBC networks, including NBC, The Olympics Channel, Golf Channel, Telemundo, Universo, and more. Plus, YouTube TV will support 4K streaming of Olympics coverage on the Olympic Channel and Golf Channel for subscribers to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550583/youtube-tv-4k-plus-offline-downloads-now-available-price"&gt;4K Plus add-on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPujP7"&gt;YouTube TV costs $65 per month. Its 4K Plus add-on costs an additional $20 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oFgIxR"&gt;FuboTV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mRBWmq"&gt;FuboTV will offer full coverage of the Games through a partnership with NBCUniversal. The service will also support 4K HDR streaming in five markets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KblxYe"&gt;FuboTV costs $65 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yIwubc"&gt;Sling TV Blue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JNni6j"&gt;Sling TV’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/service/sling-blue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue package&lt;/a&gt; will carry coverage of the Games, including a live broadcast of the opening ceremony through NBC Sports Network and NBC in select markets. For additional access to the other cable networks that broadcast the Games — USA Network, CNBC, NBCSN, Olympic Channel, and the Golf Channel — Sling users can subscribe to the service’s Sports Extra or News Extra add-on packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0zUyY"&gt;Before subscribing to these packages, however, Sling told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that all Sling TV subscribers will have free access to the Olympic Channel and NBC Universo during the duration of the Games. No additional action is necessary to see the channels; they will appear automatically beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJwGUo"&gt;Sling TV’s Blue package costs $35 per month. Its Sports Extra package costs an additional $11 per month, and its News Extra package costs $6 per month. However, new subscribers to Sling who sign up now will pay only $10 for the first month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QeCtAn"&gt;The service’s Entertainment package starts at $70 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s Steam Deck technically lets you swap the SSD, targets 30fps gameplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHNOo0HqUqN0c1vfFyWTdxhpLh0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618847/steam_deck_hades.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zhuDDd"&gt;Some important details have emerged about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck handheld console-meets-PC&lt;/a&gt; — particularly about its target performance level and whether you can actually install your own NVMe SSD to upgrade storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PqS67"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/steam-deck-valve-talks-hardware-power-controller-comfort-and-more"&gt;video interview from &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Valve stated that the Steam Deck’s 800p display, capable of up to a 60Hz refresh rate, will be targeting 30Hz for gameplay. In other words, the Nintendo Switch comparisons might go a little deeper than the surface, as many games on that platform run well below 60 frames per second. Though, given that most PC games offer a trove of graphical settings to fine-tune, the Steam Deck should be able to achieve smoother gameplay at the cost of graphical quality if you’re willing to knock down a few settings, depending on the game of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkyo4A"&gt;Valve also shared that, crucially, the standard M.2 2230-sized SSDs used in the Steam Deck &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;soldered to the board. In the world of gaming laptops, this usually means that effort has been made to ensure that M.2 SSDs are easy to swap out for, say, a bigger one you might already have on hand, or one that maybe doesn’t cost as much as Valve is charging for storage upgrades. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-ssd-upgradeable-valve"&gt;An article from &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms that you can technically remove and upgrade the storage in a Steam Deck yourself, but the focus is on repairability, not for increasing the tweak factor for the everyday user. So, those SSD slots may not be as accessible as we’re hoping, like the PS5’s slot that’s covered in an easy-to-remove plastic shield, but we don’t know for certain as Valve hasn’t shown off the inside of the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Steam Deck multiplayer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWPmQf7QfRSymf3t9eAhbquARG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722262/Steam_Deck_multiplayer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9fGutf"&gt;Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;that “repairability is something we did actually focus on and try to make it as repairable as possible. But, it’s really meant for people who know what they’re doing, and have experience doing it.” If Valve isn’t exaggerating the difficulty, some people might be better off opting for a bigger microSD card to store more games — a much simpler operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3uFfr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech"&gt;The specs for the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; mention that the M.2 SSD is “not intended for end-user replacement,” after all. That won’t stop some people — voiding a warranty might, though. &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t confirm outright whether attempting to swap SSDs will void your warranty or not, though the publication says it’s likely to. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Valve, and we’ll update this post if we receive confirmation about how attempting to upgrade storage may impact warranty status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvJPI7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;The Steam Deck is available for reservation now&lt;/a&gt;, and those who were first to reserve one will be the first to receive their orders starting in December 2021. Reserving one requires a $5 investment that will go toward the final purchase. Though, unless you’ve already done it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;the console’s expected order availability is currently set for Q2 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s Smart Display is real and it’s just as pointless as we suspected</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IZO507inYUFf5uJ1_7AS9-1OwI=/236x0:2600x1576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618624/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.04.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t appear that Verizon’s Smart Assistant can do a whole lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEtNSY"&gt;We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22552037/fcc-filing-shows-verizon-amazon-alexa-smart-display"&gt;first look at Verizon’s Smart Display&lt;/a&gt; last month thanks to an FCC filing. Yesterday, Amazon confirmed the device’s existence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;as part of its Alexa Live presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being introduced as part of the Alexa Custom Assistant program that allows third-party device manufacturers to add custom assistants built on top of Alexa technology to their products, and we regret to inform you that it looks just as useless as we first suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpVTyh"&gt;Here’s what it offers: standard smart display stuff, like an eight-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, and of course, Alexa. It also comes with LTE, a spec included in the FCC filing and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/verizons-smart-display-is-real-and-responds-to-hi-verizon/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement. But the purpose of 4G appears to be limited to providing connectivity while setting up or troubleshooting Verizon home internet. Amazon says this will reduce the need to “send service technicians to a customer’s house or have a customer call the Verizon Call Center for help.” So that’s kind of a narrow use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RU8gvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4v4o9L6A2M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo4LJA"&gt;There are also Verizon-service-specific commands that can be accessed by saying “Hi, Verizon,” like checking your bill or running a speed test. You know, things you can easily do on your phone or computer. You can ask Verizon smart assistant-type questions, like the current weather, but based on a promotional video published by Amazon it looks like Verizon will... just ask Alexa for you. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HavCIk"&gt;If you ever thought to yourself, “Self, wouldn’t it be great to have a way to check my phone bill hands-free while I eat a sandwich in the kitchen?” then maybe you’ve just found your match. Otherwise, this doesn’t exactly look like the smartest of smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgAwlr"&gt;Verizon hasn’t revealed a price or firm release date yet; &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports that the display will be available later this year in limited beta testing with Verizon home internet customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Alexa’s voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqRqfU6nShSHNhS_wMFHxrpeMUY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618606/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Dot with clock (4th gen)&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="smV0Gv"&gt;Alexa’s pleasant, feminine voice has filled the homes of millions over the past few years, but now Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587130/alexa-masculine-voice-gender-ziggy-amazon-smart-assistant"&gt;finally released a masculine counterpart&lt;/a&gt; for it. Amazon is late to this — both Apple and Google have offered different voices, both feminine and masculine, in their virtual assistants for years. But late or not, it’s nice that Amazon is finally giving some choice for Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dHMIa"&gt;In addition to the two main Alexa voices, Amazon also has celebrity voices (right now you can choose between Samuel L. Jackson, Shaquille O’Neal, and Melissa McCarthy). These are programmed to work with certain phrases and answer select questions — mostly alarms and timers, jokes, or weather reports. They also cost $5 each. Any query to an Echo device that’s not supported by the chosen celebrity voice will get a response from the native Alexa voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mrqlcy"&gt;There are two ways you can change the voice of Alexa on your Echo devices: through the device itself or through the Alexa app. Note that changing the voice through the device was less reliable for us — the surest way to do it is through the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC3tSb"&gt;Changing the voice only applies to the Echo device you’re currently using — if you want to switch to the masculine voice on multiple Echo speakers or displays in your home, you’ll have to do it one at a time. It’s also not possible to change the Alexa voice used by the smartphone app itself; that remains the original, feminine voice. Hopefully, in the future Amazon will add a way to change it globally for all the Echo devices on an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wWccGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo (2020) review: music of the sphere","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"},{"title":"Amazon Echo Dot (2020) review: have a ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iTE0VW"&gt;Without further ado, here’s how to change Alexa’s voice on an Echo device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QAvHZy"&gt;On an Echo or Echo Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="14vObd"&gt;Say the command “Alexa change your voice.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yj0Gnb"&gt;If you have more than one Echo, Alexa will ask you to specify the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mNplo0"&gt;Say the name of the device you want to change the voice on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EiRUXk"&gt;If it is successful, Alexa will respond with the new voice and confirm that is how it will sound going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0aQ6zv"&gt;If it doesn’t work, Alexa will say something to the effect of “Sorry, [name of your device] doesn’t support that.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HlxiII"&gt;In the Alexa app for iOS or Android:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li id="GqPe60"&gt;Scroll down to the option for Alexa’s Voice and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="22SrTg"&gt;Say “Alexa introduce me to [name of celebrity].” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6FshSw"&gt;Alexa will switch over to the celeb voice you’ve selected and explain the things you can do with it. If you want to purchase the voice, you will be asked to confirm the charge to your Amazon account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MGZoyk"&gt;Once enabled, you can say “Hey [celeb name]” to wake the Echo device. You can also enable the voice on each Echo you want to use it on. The standard Alexa voice is still available if you use the Alexa wake word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Facebook content moderators call for company to put an end to overly restrictive NDAs </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fDX4vq"&gt;Facebook content moderators in Europe and the US are calling on the company to put an end to overly restrictive nondisclosure agreements that discourage people from speaking out about working conditions. In &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WB3wyFy5wWB89JYDbHO52ceEZoCTrkkx6Zy8orZ2D1o/viewform?edit_requested=true"&gt;a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg, and the CEOs of Covalen and Accenture, moderators say these NDAs aren’t limited to user data and help perpetuate a culture of “excessive secrecy.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi0kl8"&gt;“Despite the company’s best efforts to keep us quiet, we write to demand the company’s culture of fear and excessive secrecy ends today,” the moderators write. “No NDA can lawfully prevent us from speaking out about our working conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xgMQ"&gt;The news comes amid escalating tension between the company and its contract content moderators in Ireland. In May, a moderator named Isabella Plunkett testified before a parliamentary committee to try to push for legislative change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSOmtv"&gt;“The content that is moderated is awful,” she said. “It would affect anyone ... To help, they offer us wellness coaches. These people mean really well, but they are not doctors. They suggest karaoke and painting, but frankly, one does not always feel like singing, after having seen someone be battered to bits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoMhFt"&gt;The letter asks that the company give moderators regular access to clinical psychiatrists and psychologists. “Imagine watching hours of violent content or children abuse online as part of your day to day work,” they write. “You cannot be left unscathed. This job must not cost us our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErIrud"&gt;Moderators also want to be brought in-house, saying the current system makes them second-class citizens. They’re calling on the company to give them the same pay and benefits as full-time Facebook moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7YKeE"&gt;The letter currently has 60 signatures from moderators in Dublin, Lisbon, and Barcelona — as well as parts of the US. It was written in collaboration with Foxglove, a UK nonprofit focused on tech justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tekNt4"&gt;“Facebook content moderators worldwide work grueling shifts wading through a never-ending flood of the worst material on the internet,” wrote Foxglove director Martha Dark in a statement. “Yet, moderators don’t get proper, meaningful, clinical long term mental health support, they have to sign highly restrictive NDAs to keep them quiet about what they’ve seen and the vast majority of the workforce are employed through outsourcing companies where they don’t receive anywhere near the same support and benefits Facebook gives its own staff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNVcUd"&gt;In a statement, Facebook pushed back against the idea that moderators don’t have access to mental health care. “We recognize that reviewing content can be a difficult job, which is why we work with partners who support their employees through training and psychological support when working with challenging content,” a spokesperson said. “In Ireland, this includes 24/7 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. We also use technology to limit their exposure to graphic material as much as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaXaL7"&gt;Neither Accenture nor Covalen provided a statement prior to publication. &lt;/p&gt;
