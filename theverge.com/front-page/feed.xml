    <title>Firefox’s address bar has ads now, but you can disable them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVsPZjUBMkwtqnWB8_6a58ooxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966530/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2wVhKH"&gt;Mozilla introduced a new suggested search result feature in the Firefox address bar as part of &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/93.0/releasenotes/"&gt;the 93.0 release of its browser&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not too surprising — Firefox Suggest, Mozilla’s feature for “surfacing relevant information and sites to help you accomplish your goals,” is similar to suggestions offered by most browsers. But &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/760177/firefox-is-getting-ads-in-your-search-bar/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/navigate-web-faster-firefox-suggest"&gt;support pages&lt;/a&gt;, it also includes content from paid advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ7aRO"&gt;“When contextual suggestions are enabled, Firefox Suggest uses your city location and search keywords to make contextual suggestions from Firefox and our partners, while keeping your privacy in mind,” the support post reads. The “relevant suggestions” from “trusted partners” appear at the bottom of the usual search suggestions pulled from your bookmarks, browser history, and open tabs — a less intrusive version of a search ad, but technically still an ad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LMLqyxH6XNvqY-eyLAadFir_0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908519/firefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see results from partners at the bottom of Firefox Suggest results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEbSXp"&gt;According to the support page, Firefox Suggest doesn’t require any new data to be “collected, stored, or shared to make these new recommendations,” and the company only works with partners that meet Mozilla’s privacy standards for Firefox. The feature has also been kicking around since at least the previous 92.0 release, even though it first appeared in the current version’s release notes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MMB838Qir7f6MI97-bM_dtVi94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908730/disablefirefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can disable Firefox Suggest in settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iEmzP2"&gt;After updating to the newest version of the browser, Firefox might present you with a pop-up asking if you want to enable “contextual suggestions” or adjust your settings. If you accidentally enabled any of the  Firefox Suggest features without realizing it, you can still disable them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tHNYnV"&gt;Click on the hamburger menu and then select Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EZLxFD"&gt;Click on Privacy and Security in the sidebar and scroll to Address Bar — Firefox Suggest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G8ADPT"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for contextual suggestions to turn the feature on or off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RFAhFN"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for “occasional sponsored suggestions”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yuO8AK"&gt;It’s slightly disappointing to have to manage a feature like this. Firefox is a popular alternative to browsers like Google Chrome because it’s stricter with users’ privacy and generally less data-hungry. If you trust Mozilla and want to support it, Firefox Suggest might not be a huge bother. It’s also not the first time the company has dabbled in advertising — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17326184/firefox-ads-sponsored-content-pocket-suggestions"&gt;Mozilla incorporated paid advertiser links&lt;/a&gt; and Pocket article reading suggestions in new tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s browser is now available for its Wear OS smartwatches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vceeJObRzlEBHUmcTc9T0oe_EVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966520/dbohn_210816_4717_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s latest smartwatches.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N0i2wd"&gt;Samsung has brought its Samsung Internet web browser to the new Wear OS-based Galaxy Watch 4 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Browsing on a watch doesn’t sound like my ideal way to surf the web for a long period of time, but I could see how it could be useful for small tasks like checking a name or looking up a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztCSdZ"&gt;I don’t have a Galaxy Watch 4, so I can’t give you hands-on experience of how the Samsung Internet browser works. But based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; testing&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung has thought of some neat tricks to make it possible to navigate the web on your wrist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XBhlGR"&gt;An obvious question about a web browser on your wrist is how exactly that tiny, circular display can manage to show full webpages. Samsung’s answer is with gestures. A guide will come up when you navigate to your first webpage that explains a diagonal swipe from either side of the screen will allow users to get to the corners of a webpage. Meanwhile, a swipe up reveals options for bookmarks, “Zoom mode,” and a shortcut to send the webpage directly to your connected phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="meVthU"&gt;This new browser only adds to what you can already get with the Galaxy Watch 4 series of smartwatches, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;which we thought were pretty good&lt;/a&gt; — as long as you’re already using a Samsung phone, that is. It should be noted that a browser on a smartwatch isn’t new, though; Samsung also has a browser for its &lt;a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/geardetail/com.samsung.wbrowser?langCd=en"&gt;Tizen-based smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Apple Watch has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17841742/apple-watch-update-new-features-os-5-release-date"&gt;built-in browsing capabilities&lt;/a&gt; (though there’s no dedicated Apple Watch version of Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cutCkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Galaxy Watch 4 review: welcome to Samsung’s garden","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Foundation is getting a second season on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="foundation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VtdNWXYfaDAmzgSvjlnHAlIBfhQ=/552x0:3432x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966466/Foundation_Photo_010201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUeTI8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has been renewed for a second season on Apple TV Plus, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2Fapple-tv-renews-global-hit-drama-series-foundation-for-a-second-season%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715363%2Ffoundation-renewed-second-season-apple-tv-plus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple announced today&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the release of the fourth episode of the first season on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="okqv8M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="caQlc3"&gt;The renewal is a vote of confidence from Apple, as one of the flagship shows on Apple TV Plus, meant to help bring in viewers as a prestige genre show in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; does for HBO, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; does for Disney Plus, or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix. That said, outside of today’s press release (where Apple calls the show “a global hit” that “quickly proved to resonate with audiences”), the company hasn’t even provided vague estimates of how popular the show has been so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xecQq"&gt;“With season two, our audience will get to visit more of Asimov’s indelible characters and worlds, including Hober Mallow, General Bel Riose, and all the Outer Suns,” showrunner and executive producer David S. Goyer said in Apple’s press release, indicating that the second season will at least in part cover the latter half of Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation,&lt;/em&gt; as well as its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Foundation and Empire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPOE56"&gt;Goyer has big ambitions for the series, too; in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/david-s-goyer-interview-1234983774/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he mentioned that his original pitch to Apple was eight seasons long. And while Apple hasn’t publicly commented on how much the lavish series costs, Goyer mentioned that “if you were to take two episodes and put them together, the budget is bigger than some of the movies I’ve done.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2k4Mq"&gt;Apple’s announcement doesn’t say which (if any) of its season one cast members will be returning for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. But given the anthology nature of Asimov’s novels — which are a collection of short stories that span centuries of time — it’s likely that a second season would bring new faces to the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONCmVY"&gt;Whether Apple is willing to pony up for the full 80 episodes that Goyer envisions to properly tell his story is still an unanswered question, but with a second season on the way, it seems that &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;fans will at least get to see the entirety of Asimov’s first book adapted in live-action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7vBlJ"&gt;The remainder of&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season airs weekly on Fridays on Apple TV Plus; no release date for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;preorder one of the recently announced Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tA5jd3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Right now, there aren’t deals available on the 38mm Series 3, which is only available for its standard price of $199 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYnqufKYm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1161528/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101052%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000087521670%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0064R00001AFOp3QAH-Apple_GoogleSearch_AO_Q4_FY21_AO%26adgroup%3DPLA_Apple%2BAirTag%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9004339%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtfqKBhBoEiwAZuesiJUi6dcVJIyvV2yp8_t07QEQXzMl8yEsT1GQ2bYjHatSoPfkIJXtHxoC6DAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. For that price, you might as well spring for the larger, 42mm configuration; both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the red and blue models are both seeing a steep discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with both retailing for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the pink (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1149510/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F683927568&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A9987250&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=9987250" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5SQ3MG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and white models (&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5V1YWL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), are available for $415 at the same retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and YouTube will cut off ad money for climate change deniers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TFjnh6ir5kwdKu91SpykoqB3Ac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965820/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoHg1u"&gt;Google will no longer allow advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators to monetize content that denies the existence of climate change. The company detailed the changes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOxbM6"&gt;“Today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” the Google Ads team said in the document. “This includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3ybf"&gt;Google says it will use a mix of automated tools and human reviews to enforce the policy. “When evaluating content against this new policy, we’ll look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim,” Google said. Ads will still be allowed on climate topics like public debates on climate policy, research, and more, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWCsgW"&gt;The increased action against climate change deniers marks Google’s second big misinformation policy change in recent days, arriving about a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700171/youtube-vaccine-misinformation-antivax-ban"&gt;YouTube banned vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It follows new features announced by the search giant intended to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711623/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-footprint-maps-search-travel"&gt;shrink their carbon footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s next project is a murder mystery for Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLhzBaN9EzPTC-Qn98sr5yr3GCU=/67x0:1795x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_07_at_11.45.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xCARw"&gt;Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the producers behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the writer-directors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/10/5396322/the-lego-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are bringing their talents to Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Afterparty&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-reveals-first-look-teaser-of-highly-anticipated-murder-mystery-comedy-series-the-afterparty-ahead-of-january-2022-debut-on-apple-tv/"&gt;a new eight-part murder-mystery comedy series&lt;/a&gt; created and directed by Miller, with both Lord and Miller serving as showrunners and executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OIwlr"&gt;The new series “centers on a murder mystery at a high school reunion,” Apple says, with each episode featuring “a retelling of the same night told through a different character’s perspective, each with its own unique visual style and film genre to match the teller’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IBgSf"&gt;The show stars Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz, and Ilana Glazer, among several other comedy stars (and apparently Dave Franco). It’s hard to get a real sense of the details of the plot based off this first trailer (Haddish is investigating the murder?), but the premise and cast are certainly promising. Plus, stories with equally vague premises — &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; starts as &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/game-night-review.html"&gt;a movie about people playing board games&lt;/a&gt; before it gets wacky — have historically allowed for plenty of shocking twists and humorous setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlutM4"&gt;Lord and Miller have another streaming project in the works as well. In February 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276330/hbo-max-clone-high-animated-series-season-2"&gt;HBO Max announced&lt;/a&gt; it was reviving Lord, Miller, and Bill Lawrence’s animated show &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt; for the streaming service. Apple already has a successful working relationship with Lawrence, who’s a co-creator of its &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/emmys-2021-winners-full-list.html"&gt;Emmy-winning comedy &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25MU7v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afterparty &lt;/em&gt;will premiere globally on Apple TV Plus in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new $10 million fund for VR creators is hopefully just the beginning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zIygZVzAb-yyl9CEtzo3nMFi-XM=/68x0:713x430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965559/243689806_580600176613230_3239613562166238562_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from Horizon Worlds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LRWzWu"&gt;Facebook has announced a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/expanding-horizon-new-funding-to-support-creators/"&gt;$10 million Creator Fund&lt;/a&gt; to encourage people to build experiences on its Horizon VR platform, which it is now calling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Ffacebook-horizon%2Fsign-up%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. Although Horizon Worlds is still in beta, the company clearly wants to get more people making content for the platform to offer more experiences that could be interesting to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEEVwY"&gt;The funds will be given out “over the next year” in three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="PoHoE8"&gt;A series of community competitions to build “the very best worlds in Horizon.” Facebook will give up to $10,000 in cash for the top three entrants in the competitions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="82dbYN"&gt;A Creator Accelerator Program that’s “designed to give people from diverse backgrounds an advanced crash course in Horizon Worlds creation.” Facebook finished a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Finside-the-facebook-horizon-creator-accelerator-program%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pilot of the program in September&lt;/a&gt; and will accept applications in November for the next iteration of the program, which will launch in “early” 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cLAIEl"&gt;Funding for developers who are interested in making “experiences for Horizon in a particular theme.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id="pLTGkY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwVV-zczHYI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=2&amp;amp;start=2" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAZTmh"&gt;The Creator Fund could help Facebook in its big bet on virtual worlds. The company has invested heavily in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;and ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants people to eventually see Facebook as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;“a metaverse company.”&lt;/a&gt; One example of what that could look like is Facebook’s Horizons Workrooms app, which is designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;be a VR meeting room for work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTSLHj"&gt;But as Facebook is racing to build out Horizon Worlds and get people to create content for it, it faces stiff competition from other metaverse makers like Epic Games (the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;) and Roblox — which both also rely heavily on user-created content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkQdQj"&gt;While Facebook’s Creator Fund is a positive step toward ensuring creators get paid for building virtual experiences, I’m hoping the company invests significantly more in creators down the line. I suspect it has the ability to; the $10 million put toward the fund is a drop in the bucket compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598592/facebook-second-quarter-earnings-29-billion"&gt;more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; Facebook earned in profit in its second quarter. Otherwise, Horizons could turn into yet another platform where creators are fighting for scraps while its owner reaps the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder and Lyft partner so you can send your match a ride for an IRL date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yysrEaM3S5W7IxREyx-nzOrVr0o=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965450/lyft_tinder.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft and Tinder have partnered to offer free rides | Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqk1lB"&gt;Dating app Tinder and ride-hailing company Lyft are partnering on a new feature that lets Tinder members buy a Lyft ride for a potential date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345181/tinder-lyft-gift-ride-date"&gt;Tinder first teased&lt;/a&gt; the new feature in March and is now rolling it out to its subscribers as a way to “get back to making IRL connections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSP67f"&gt;Tinder members can access the Lyft integration from a new Explore section of Tinder’s app, where they can buy a Lyft ride credit for a person they’ve matched with. The person buying the credit doesn’t get any details about the recipient's address but can set the location, time, and value of the credit they want to purchase. Then, the recipient gets a link via either a phone number or email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXlTyl"&gt;Tinder calls the feature a “thoughtful gesture while promoting personal safety for those ready to ‘get back out there’ after way too many months inside.” It’s a totally optional feature, and members don’t have to accept any gifted ride, the company stresses, but there doesn’t appear to be a way to opt out of the feature altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GsjPP"&gt;The sender can choose a one-way or roundtrip ride and will get a refund if the recipient doesn’t use the Lyft ride or only uses part of it. Both sender and recipient need to have Lyft accounts to participate; if the recipient doesn’t have one at the time they get the link, they can create one at that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o0Bk2"&gt;Of course, there are ways that the feature could be misused, like say, in an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-guadalupe-gonzales-pleads-not-guilty-dine-and-dash-dating-allegations-2018-09-08/"&gt;elaborate dine-and-dash&lt;/a&gt; scheme, or if you really want a free Lyft ride and trick someone into giving you one for a date you don’t show up for, but those are sort of the pitfalls of dating in the digital age and aren’t exclusive to any one dating app. And, of course, you can always just swipe left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeTsFz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psnqxj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gbV6r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnhvPF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QUWPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Epic v. Apple, a small developer is challenging Apple’s in-app payment system</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdlTDs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"&gt;The ambiguous finish to the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt; opened a tiny crack in Apple’s control over in-app payments on the iPhone — and now, a small developer is trying to crawl through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbM0H1"&gt;A company called Paddle &lt;a href="https://paddle.com/platform/in-app-purchase/"&gt;has announced its own in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that will take a smaller cut than Apple’s system — 5 to 10 percent, instead of the 15 to 30 percent cut claimed by Apple. It’s a way around the commission fees that started the fight with Epic in the first place and likely to be the beginning of a new fight for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90WU9S"&gt;Paddle’s system is designed to take advantage of the Epic v. Apple verdict, which required Apple to allow external payment links. Prior to the verdict, an App Store rule had banned “external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” — but the judge found that rule violated anti-steering laws. Paddle’s system offers just such an external link, kicking users off to an outside page where they can pay before returning to the app. It definitely adds friction to the process, but it’s a far cry from the workarounds you’d have to go through if you wanted to skirt Apple’s IAP system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwLH1X"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment as to whether apps using the system would be allowed on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7u271vGlnNzBu4fInAkQ__BuzgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907920/iap_demo_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Paddle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of what a Paddle “in-app purchase” would look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgTiqz"&gt;One of Paddle’s biggest selling points is its fees — Apple famously takes a 30 percent cut (or a 15 percent cut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;if you make less than $1 million on the App Store in a year&lt;/a&gt;) on in-app purchases for most developers. Paddle is offering a 10 percent cut on payments less than $10 and a 5 percent plus $0.50 charge on payments above $10. It’s not hard to see how switching from Apple’s payment system would be attractive for some developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdgWap"&gt;The real test will be seeing how apps that include Paddle’s payments fare during App Review. If Apple wants to find violations of its rules in apps using Paddle, it very likely will. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;company has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to figure out how it can change its rules to comply with the judge’s order, but so far, the new rules haven’t been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCjjfm"&gt;Paddle told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an emailed statement that the company was waiting to see how the details of the ruling were implemented and that it’s built a few versions of its system to make it easier to adapt to whatever Apple’s rules end up being. It plans on launching its in-app payment service on December 7th, and the company’s CEO said that it “would welcome Apple’s view on this to bring more clarity.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Paddle’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPJs3q"&gt;You may also want to keep in mind the privacy implications of developers being able to communicate with users, as mentioned in the order — Paddle says that, unlike Apple, it’ll let developers see customers’ email addresses to help with billing support. While that comes with benefits (like developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/24/apple-in-app-refund-notification-changes/"&gt;actually getting to be involved in the refund process&lt;/a&gt;), you may want to keep in mind that you could be sharing your email address when you’re kicked over to a Paddle payment screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzwNGG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will competition bring out the best in Apple, or will it prove the company right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhwIy"&gt;Paddle also lists other benefits of its IAP platform, such as developers being able to price their app how they want without worrying if Apple will approve, the ability to set pricing on a country-by-country basis, and the ability to provide coupons. And, of course, the smaller cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYIXv0"&gt;With this being the first big challenge to Apple’s own IAP system since the ruling, it’s likely to attract a lot of attention (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446117510919585796?s=20"&gt;is already tweeting about it&lt;/a&gt;). Part of what makes the proposition so exciting is that, until this point, the arguments for either side have been mostly theoretical. If a competing in-app purchase system really does start making it to apps, and it takes off, we’ll get to see whether the competition will make Apple’s service better, as some developers have argued, or if it will lead to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;even worse proliferation of scams&lt;/a&gt;, where developers charge $100 a year for a weather app, as Apple has implied. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game developer Eidos-Montréal is switching to a four-day workweek</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aa2OL3"&gt;Eidos-Montréal and its subsidiary Eidos-Sherbrooke are switching to a four-day workweek, the game developer &lt;a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/news/eidos-montreal-and-eidos-sherbrooke-shifting-to-the-4-day-work-week/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Square Enix-owned company is currently working on the next big Marvel video game adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687700/guardians-of-the-galaxy-square-enix-action-rpg-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r02QjB"&gt;“This initiative is another step towards the embodiment of the studio’s values, building a healthy, creative, and sustainable work environment for our employees,” studio head David Anfossi writes in the company’s blog. “The idea is not to condense the working hours into four days, but rather to review our ways of doing things and our quality time invested, with the aim of working better!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8NjqAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 32-hour workweek&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbCSNX"&gt;Eidos-Montréal says that both studios will be closed on Fridays in the next few weeks, “without changing the working conditions currently in place nor the salaries of employees, thus switching from the 40-hour week to 32-hour.” The company isn’t entirely clear on how it plans to adapt to the new structure but suggests one change would be implementing shorter meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1daOHQ"&gt;Reexamining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;work schedules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256060/twitter-employees-work-from-home-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;work-from-home policies&lt;/a&gt; have been a welcome change brought on by the pandemic. In the context of the video game industry, it’s notable because of how frequently employees are expected or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;forced to overwork themselves to hit deadlines&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no guarantee a shorter workweek will prevent crunch from happening, but it does at least bake in more time when workers can expect to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
