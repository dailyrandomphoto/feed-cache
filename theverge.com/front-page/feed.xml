    <title>Guardians of the Galaxy is part action RPG, part dysfunctional family simulator</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBgaZG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Square Enix’s latest attempt at adapting a Marvel franchise into a successful video game, is best described as — and I mean this as a glowing compliment — a Dysfunctional Family Management Sim. As Peter Quill, your job is to motivate, reassure, comfort, and lead your merry band of found-family misfits through dialogue choices designed to profoundly impact gameplay and story. I had the opportunity to play a full chapter of the game ahead of its release, and I gotta say, I’m impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YUYhj"&gt;It is, however, fair to say that my enthusiasm for what I’ve seen of &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; so far is because I kept my expectations in check. There have been excellent Marvel games in the past — one need only look over yonder to what Insomniac has done with &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; and will probably do with &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt;. But Square Enix’s specific track record with the Marvel franchise has been underwhelming. Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;excellent single-player campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but it was largely overshadowed by a repetitive loot grind, lack of significant endgame content (heh), and a performance plagued by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545477/marvels-avengers-bug-ip-address-on-screen-square-enix"&gt;nasty bugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojXmog"&gt;People have a right to be skeptical, but what I’ve seen of &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; makes me think things will be different. It’s as though Square Enix and developer Eidos-Montréal took what was best about &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; and spun that out into its own game. It’s a choice-driven, story-focused game that can at times feel more like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338970/guardians-of-the-galaxy-telltale-game-episode-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telltale Guardians game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than a Square Enix action RPG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jbzeea7tjWFLj-UNOu_BZKF5-aE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869624/guardians.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QqXxB9"&gt;The demo started on the Milano, the Guardians’ ship, and I was given free rein to walk about having casual conversations with Gamora, Groot, Drax, and Rocket. As you speak to them, you’re presented with dialogue choices and a timer, ala Telltale’s &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;. These choices grant you different bits of your friends’ history and the chance to develop a connection with the people you’ll be entrusting your life to later in combat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l48AcO"&gt;Player choice in action games can sometimes feel a bit shallow, especially when the consequences end up being, at best, a slightly different bit of dialogue. &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; does a decent job of making it feel like your choices mean something. Your decisions as Star-Lord can mean the difference between fighting a horde of mind-controlled enemies or escaping unseen and unheard without a scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfsluw"&gt;Both Mary DeMarle, senior narrative director, and Patrick Fortier, senior gameplay director, emphasized the importance of choice in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; and the extent to which it impacts the game. “Some of the choices that you make will ultimately determine at the end of the game the secret weapons and people who you might have in your arsenal as you’re going up against the Big Bad,” DeMarle says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K282AZ"&gt;Fighting in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; is typical action RPG fare. Playing as Star-Lord, you zip around the battlefield in your rocket boots as you shoot up enemies with elemental bullets. Skill points unlock powerful moves that increase your combo meter and, thereby, the rewards you get at the end of a fight. Your companions are controlled by AI to fight as they please, but you, as the leader, can command them to execute special moves when you need some heavier hitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYHOyd"&gt;Though the combat in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; isn’t particularly revolutionary, I found myself chuckling aloud at times, amused by the combos I was able to pull off. You can direct your Guardians to take advantage of environmental hazards. I got a big kick out of commanding Gamora to cut down a piece of construction to squish a particularly troublesome enemy after I had frozen him in place with my ice bullets. In combat, there are lots of opportunities to create those kinds of unique one-two punches, and they enhance the idea that the Guardians can be a functional, loving, kick-ass family when they stop bickering and get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4_LPGGAhqCQKl4yssWUnskEPVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869637/guardians2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4tItUx"&gt;Choice in &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; not only affects how you experience the game and the success of combat but how your companions react to you as well. A cold word said or deed done to Rocket in an earlier chapter influences whether or not he wants to cooperate with you later in the game. There’s a moment in the demo in which Rocket stubbornly refuses to hack a lock because he was pissed off that I didn’t take his side in a disagreement. It made me choose Rocket-friendly options going forward, to both soothe his hurt feelings and to get him to do his job. It’s a nice change of pace that an AI companion had a story reason to ignore me rather than a mechanical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71b3yy"&gt;I love when characters adapt and respond to the way you treat them. That kind of cause and effect storytelling is well-suited to the highly temperamental personalities that make up the Guardians. It takes these characters from one-dimensional combat helper-bots to fully actualized companions. I had my doubts about &lt;em&gt;Guardians,&lt;/em&gt; and those doubts largely disappeared in the short time I spent with this game. Knowing there’s a full game on the horizon, I’m excited to see more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2C6hL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The imaginary rocket driving a small-town spaceport</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is the FAA licensing spaceports that are doomed to fail?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YGwrnt"&gt;The latest launch attempt out of Kodiak, Alaska’s spaceport shows in vivid detail just how quickly things can go sideways.  In the video, rocket maker Astra’s 3.3 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdohwm8Quc&amp;amp;t=80s"&gt;skids &lt;/a&gt;horizontally for hundreds of yards, then shoots some 20 miles upwards, listing off course. Ground crew terminates the flight, and the craft free falls back to Earth in pieces, landing in a fireball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Zc1iil"&gt;None of Astra’s six test flights from Kodiak’s Pacific Spaceport Complex have made it into orbit, and five have exploded. But, as Jeff Bezos says, failure and innovation are inseparable twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1niN2z"&gt;Analysts expect the commercial space industry to be worth &lt;a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; by 2040, and increasingly, &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/08/08/michigan-spaceport-marquette-aerospace-manufacturers-association-wurtsmith-oscoda-airport/3323976001/"&gt;small&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2021/02/13/news/aroostook/historic-rocket-launch-makes-maine-a-viable-spaceport-location/"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt; are angling to get in on the action. One such community is Camden County, Georgia, where a group of county commissioners is longing for their own spaceport — and the economic growth and diversification they hope will come with it. There’s one caveat: Spaceport Camden’s sole proposed launch trajectory would, in an unprecedented move, cross &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/style/space-race-cumberland-island-georgia.html"&gt;two populated islands&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a federally protected marshland and wilderness, just a few miles from the toxic brownfield set to become the launch site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSh1bV"&gt;To some residents, this seems like an astronomically bad idea. But failures — even explosive ones — don’t faze Camden County: according to spaceport planners, Astra is a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpaceportCamden/posts/2921889351419214"&gt;prime launch tenant candidate&lt;/a&gt;, and Alaska Aerospace Corporation, which runs Kodiak’s spaceport, could become an &lt;a href="https://akaerospace.com/news/alaska-aerospace-corporation-and-camden-county-sign-mou/"&gt;operation partner&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0f8f3"&gt;All they need to get this plan off the ground is an operation license from the Federal Aviation Administration. And to secure that, they aren’t basing their proposal on rockets like the one that blew up in Alaska — instead, they’re using models of rockets that don’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ftW7Y6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lofty Ambitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="8nHIVn"&gt;In the FAA’s nearly 40 years of commercial rocket oversight, the agency has never permitted anyone to launch vertical rockets directly over populated areas closer than 500 miles away. (The US once launched a rocket over Cuba in the 1960s; debris landed in a field there, 511 miles from the launch pad, and apparently killed a cow, spurring anti-American protests in Havana.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMYwDE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The county has spent more than $10 million to secure an FAA license&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3HBKZ"&gt;Unfortunately, this unprecedented move is critical to Camden County’s plan, leaving some people worried about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wanzong/status/1433637810943135749"&gt;falling debris&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wabe.org/warnock-urges-faa-not-to-cut-corners-on-spaceport-review/"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; igniting the flammable palmetto and oak forests that coat the archipelago in the flight path.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edizga"&gt;But the county’s spaceport steering committee is so confident that it can break the mold, it has spent &lt;a href="https://www.spaceportfacts.org/money-spent"&gt;more than $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in the past nine years to help secure this FAA license. According to emails obtained through open-records requests, this spend has gone to consultants, lobbyists, and some creative publicity efforts, like facilitating the placement of &lt;a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/25/us-rep-buddy-carter-tried-to-speed-review-of-spaceport-with-amendment/114873454/"&gt;a June 2020 op-ed&lt;/a&gt; designed to compel then-president Trump to pressure the FAA into a faster decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK6Fwr"&gt;It didn’t work; the FAA has yet to issue their verdict. Their record of decision is &lt;a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/permitting-projects/spaceport-camden-proposed-launch-site-environmental-impact-statement"&gt;slated for this month&lt;/a&gt; — the last regulatory step that comes before the licensing determination. Everything hinges on whether or not operating a spaceport out of Camden’s county seat of Woodbine, population 1,400, could launch, according to the FAA, “at least one type of launch vehicle” safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMyPVS"&gt;Together, county and federal agency officials have put together an &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/environmental/nepa_docs/camden_eis/"&gt;Environmental Impact Statement&lt;/a&gt; that lays out the evidence: a master document filled with the results of risk analyses based on rocket size, thrust, weight, trajectory, behavior, failure rate and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeqCm9"&gt;Published in June, this document does not look at the Astra rockets officials say they may one day launch — the ones that routinely crash. Rather, to prove safety, they bring in data from a much more reliable rocket, a “hypothetical” one that has yet to be invented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ZKJkd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is exactly the sort of catastrophic failure that can happen over our coast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObvPqL"&gt;Present-day rockets are too heavy, so the officials made their hypothetical rocket much lighter. They don’t gain altitude quickly enough, so the officials devised a first-of-its-kind “lofted trajectory.” If something goes wrong on a small-lift vehicle launch today, humans on the ground analyze data before terminating the flight, which could take several seconds. Camden’s proposed rocket has a sleek automated flight termination system that works in fractions of a second instead. And today’s small-lift vehicles — this class of small, uncrewed utilitarian rockets like Astra’s — are too big to be safe in this scenario, so the officials envision something almost half the size of the smallest rocket currently being developed, much less deployed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzjCIi"&gt;A tested and proven craft with these characteristics is nowhere on the horizon. While companies were “&lt;a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-03/why-private-companies-are-racing-build-small-rockets"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt;” to build small rockets as of 2016, early in Camden County’s application process, today, the business case for super-small rockets is &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-small-rockets.html"&gt;debated&lt;/a&gt;, and companies who have been most successful in this niche to date are pivoting to bigger craft &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/rocket-lab-not-yet-close-to-profitability-proxy-statement-reveals/"&gt;in search of profitability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFzkJh"&gt;But spaceport critics like Steve Weinkle, a retired head of design engineering who lives a few miles from the proposed launch site, argue a hypothetical rocket isn’t useful when it comes to calculating actual risk. Kodiak, he says, is what’s real, and the launch history there should be a wake-up call for the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTsWD7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA says it accounts for “a non-zero probability of failure”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R7TSAT"&gt;“That is exactly the sort of catastrophic failure that can happen over our coast, Cumberland Island, and near Kings Bay [the county’s naval base, where large ordnance is stored],” Weinkle wrote on his &lt;a href="https://www.spaceportfacts.org/"&gt;spaceport watchdog blog&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to Astra’s dramatic Kodiak crash. “Yet, for some unknown reason, the FAA tells us that we have nothing to worry about since their calculations assume that everything on their ‘representative rocket’ will work perfectly.” ​​ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="LA6gd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="OT7VVr"&gt;In Spaceport Camden’s EIS, the FAA declines to put numbers to the possibility of failure on the basis that the potential for “adverse impacts associated with launch failures” is “not planned” and would be “unlikely.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNxCwZ"&gt;The executive director of the agency’s Office of Operational Safety, Daniel Murray, leaned hard on this optimism in an August letter responding to concerns about damage to cultural resources. “There is no anticipation of any fire or damage during a nominal launch,” Murray assured Georgia’s Advisory Council on Historic Preservation — with a footnote specifying that “nominal” refers to a launch where all aspects of the flight go “as expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rzymyB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“irresponsible, at best”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BlDphx"&gt;A spokesperson for the FAA clarified in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the agency has never said the hypothetical rocket will “work perfectly” and that their risk analyses did account for “a non-zero probability of failure (i.e., there could or would be a failure).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6eFNU"&gt;But after tracking the frequent catastrophic failures among launches that are happening, Weinkle said it’s “irresponsible, at best” to issue a license declaring the site safe for a spaceport “when your measure of safety is that you don’t plan on anything going wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StAtQ3"&gt;The county and its consultants argue that to keep up with a rapidly changing industry, innovators need to be constantly looking ahead. It would be impossible to prove safety looking just at the current landscape: more than 100 companies are trying to design the next small-lift success, 10 are in development, and of those, only one — Rocket Lab’s Electron — has ever even made it into orbit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7noaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Officials acknowledged the risk in internal FAA emails&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3imQA"&gt;Electron was a major source of inspiration for Camden County planners, cited by name in the EIS. But while it may be the safest rocket of its kind, when asked if it might be safe enough to launch over a populated area, its maker, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck, said he wouldn’t try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN6dP"&gt;“We have a very deep commitment to public safety here, so we certainly would not ever endanger the public in that way. It’s just — not cool,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said of launching over people just 50 miles into the rocket’s flight path. “But, I mean, there’s just no way that the FAA would agree to that. I just can’t imagine how that would ever happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhnu0R"&gt;Internal emails show the agency was hesitant, too. Officials acknowledged back in 2017 that the risk to people on the islands in the proposed flight path was “&lt;a href="https://www.wabe.org/faa-struggled-to-get-safety-info-on-camden-spaceport-for-years-emails-show/"&gt;a problem from the very beginning&lt;/a&gt;.” Writing internally, even Murray himself expressed concerns. “I’m not sure a small vehicle is safe enough,” he wrote in an internal FAA email. “I think they need to speak to why they are not assuming an explosive impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1bljs"&gt;According to Ramon Lugo, the director of the Florida Space Institute at the University of Central Florida who has worked with NASA since 1975, that won’t necessarily pose an obstacle to securing an operation license for the spaceport itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="nrNZAJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My guess is... there aren’t going to be a lot of rockets lined up to launch from Spaceport Camden.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pJqZBt"&gt;“The FAA Commercial Space Transportation Office’s mission is not to deny licenses,” Lugo said, noting the agency’s “dual mandate” to both regulate and foster the industry. “Their mission is to try to find a way to make it work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0siGJ"&gt;And just because a spaceport site has an operation license doesn’t guarantee future operators will be successful in securing launch licenses, Lugo added. That is a separate process altogether — and a more rigorous one that requires verifiable data from existing rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uyiy7"&gt;The FAA has granted just 413 of these in 40 years of launching commercial satellite payloads into orbit. If that hurdle is overcome for Spaceport Camden, a launch operator would theoretically need to have a vehicle as safe as the rocket as the project’s EIS suggests. And then, they’d have to insure the flight — a daunting proposition considering the unusual launch trajectory, Lugo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ixZFp"&gt;“My guess is when that part comes to pass, there aren’t going to be a lot of rockets lined up to launch from Spaceport Camden,” he said. (Astra did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IT6Nbk"&gt;Still, it’s surprisingly common for commercial spaceports to lie unused after approval. Commercial projects in &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/fox-25-investigates/twenty-years-in-was-oklahomas-space-investment-worth-it"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/24/adams-county-space-port-japanese-pd/"&gt;Colorado,&lt;/a&gt; Texas, and elsewhere have secured their operation licenses years ago and are still waiting for their first launch and the economic windfall that is supposed to come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4vpg9h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaceports That Don’t Take Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3Y0UED"&gt;Stacy Studebaker, a retired schoolteacher who has lived on Kodiak Island for 30 years, remembers the song and dance about economic development: “The people who started it came in and said, ‘We’re going to turn these fishermen into rocket scientists,’ and ‘We’re going to have college classes,’ and they had astronauts come into town, and had big meetings with the public saying, ‘Oh, this is going to be the greatest thing for the Kodiak economy,’” she recalled of the spaceport’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/washington/12missile.html"&gt;scandal-ridden&lt;/a&gt; establishment in 1998. “It’s proved to be pretty much smoke and mirrors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJGRa7"&gt;Even if it didn’t yield the economic boom some hoped for, it’s a relative success story. After 20 years of government-funded launches, Kodiak has hosted six commercial launch attempts since 2018, while &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-georgia-business-science-c3055985c2526fb7670e363fc64d71ad"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the dozen commercial spaceports in the US have hosted none at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iINYSF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is this really the right thing for a county like Camden?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGwvD5"&gt;In Midland, Texas, public officials secured their own spaceport operations license in &lt;a href="https://www.mrt.com/business/article/FAA-approves-spaceport-license-for-Midland-7415553.php"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Their application also revolved around a representative rocket: a Branson-style experimental space-plane called the Lynx Mark I, under development by a company called XCOR. But, the rocket was never built, and XCOR went bankrupt in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFKTkr"&gt;In the meantime, Midland spent about $20 million on the venture. That amount included “$10 million in recruitment for a company that’s nowhere to be found,” Midland Councilman Spencer Robnett &lt;a href="https://midlandtx.swagit.com/play/10152019-2094"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; at a 2019 city council meeting. Robnett called the project a “waste of taxpayer dollars” and entreated colleagues to “take a hard look” at the return-on-investment so far, compared to the oil and gas economy, which has bounced back in recent years, boosting the local economy, while the spaceport has drained it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQSjjE"&gt;“We don’t need... spaceport jobs. We need houses. We need roads. We need infrastructure; we need police officers and firefighters and all those things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGNTQ0"&gt;XCOR may be “nowhere to be found,” but its former CCO and CEO, Andrew Nelson, is now on the Spaceport Camden team, helping to guide the application process. So far, he’s received more than $1 million in consulting fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3QFtW"&gt;In mid-August, a city councilman in Camden County’s other town — St. Marys — called &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ConcernedAboutSpaceportCamden/posts/1904006773092666"&gt;for a grand jury investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Spaceport Camden’s finances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny7J4p"&gt;Meanwhile, owners of 91 out of the 100 residential lots on Little Cumberland Island — one of the islands in the flight path — have signed letters to the FAA asking the agency not to approve the spaceport. The National Park Service and Department of the Interior have expressed serious concerns about the plan’s safety. Leaders of more than a dozen regional environmental advocacy organizations had signed a letter to voice concern about the “dangerous precedent that the FAA’s mishandled review could set,” and Senator Raphael Warnock requested in a letter that the agency not “cut corners” on assessing social and environmental impacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFTmOP"&gt;For these parties, the best-case scenario is that the FAA denies Woodbine a site license. But surveilling the landscape, Lugo doesn’t see that as a win either: if the site is licensed, the county will continue to spend “millions annually” on spaceport infrastructure and maintenance in a gamble with no certain payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sP1Zte"&gt;“Is this really the right thing for a county like Camden, which is not the wealthiest county?” he asked. “If I’m a taxpayer in Camden County, [I’ve] basically enabled people that have a ‘field of dreams’ vision of a launch site. What will be the opportunities lost because of that?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s behemoth CRG9 gaming monitor is $200 off right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9_2BW9jWXLo_myoPgCz8PrlXRA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892555/crg9monitor.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knWbBo"&gt;The 49-inch Samsung CRG9 is a stunning gaming monitor. Boasting an immersive 1800R curvature, it’s capable of more deeply immersing you in whatever it is you’re doing, gaming or otherwise. As you can imagine, however, its price is usually just as jaw-dropping as its size. Today, however, it’s a little less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGZthn"&gt;Right now, you can get the best bang for your buck with a gaming monitor that does the work of three. Instead of $1,100, the 49-inch Samsung CRG9 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L9HCJ2V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently $900 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, matching the monitor’s lowest price to date. As one of the most immersive monitors on the market, it offers a curved screen with a 32:9 aspect ratio, as well as bright 1,000 nit HDR, and low input lag. The 1440p monitor also supports both AMD FreeSync 2, in addition to having a high 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STZ5ld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9690066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cy1qnb"&gt;If you picked up a PlayStation 5 and are currently looking to increase your console’s storage capacity, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro SSD&lt;/a&gt; is currently sitting at its best price to date on Amazon. Normally $230, the 1TB NVMe model is now available for $180, more than 20 percent off the list price. One of the few drives that meets (and exceeds) Sony’s requirements for speed, it’s also one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;our picks for the best M.2 SSDs for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, that you will have to purchase a compatible heatsink alongside it and install it yourself. Samsung plans on releasing a model with a built-in heatsink later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JL3WjW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RksEKt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nktw3Y"&gt;Not a gamer? Fret not: we also found plenty of non-gaming deals you might be interested in today. Right now, for instance, you can pair up your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;soon-to-be-released iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; with the latest Apple Pencil, which is currently available for one of its best prices to date. Through September 29th, or while supplies last, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140759?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals092121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is selling the second-generation stylus&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon Prime members for $110 instead of $125 — $10 shy of its all-time low at Amazon. Unlike its predecessor, which awkwardly charges via the Lightning port, the newest Apple Pencil can wirelessly charge while magnetically docked to the side of the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, or iPad Air. Note, however, it doesn’t work with the forthcoming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EMflJ4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10764401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fYMHu"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable laptop that excels at the basics, the lower-specced configuration that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;my colleague Monica Chin highly recommends&lt;/a&gt; is down $200 at Best Buy. Regularly $529, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfC92IuJuRS#dotnolink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retailer is temporarily selling&lt;/a&gt; the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 with 4GB RAM, a 64GB SSD, and Intel 10th Gen Core i3 for $330. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8an7jB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ri7GO3"&gt;Also at Best Buy, you can get a huge discount on this hefty gaming laptop from Asus. Normally $1,000, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDtypFX0dY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TUF Gaming laptop is a great value for $800&lt;/a&gt;. It has a 17.3-inch display that’s capable of a 144Hz refresh rate, and it has Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5-11260H processor, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and most notably, Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. So long as you don’t mind the fact that this isn’t a very portable machine, you’re in for a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="np3afE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10767005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DXyIEn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BsWwtp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 10:20AM, 09/22/2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article originally stated that the Samsung monitor deal was for the Odyssey G9, but it was for the CRG9. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s crypto wallets are finally ready for a test run</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIFBT1mI1r6emvEnH3MVwqyNQzs=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892472/1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDtyFN"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/22/crypto-wallets-are-coming-to-robinhood"&gt;finally adding cryptocurrency wallets to its platform&lt;/a&gt; so that users can spend and trade their Bitcoin and Ethereum. The wallets will start as a test, and the company’s setting up a waitlist where people can sign up to be among the first to get access. However, this doesn’t mean that you can use Robinhood to buy stocks with Bitcoin. If you don’t mind the extra steps, the company says you can sell crypto for another currency and use that money to buy stocks. Still, it represents a big step in the company’s crypto journey, one that some of its users have been asking it to take for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CX86yM"&gt;Robinhood says it’ll start testing wallets with an “alpha” group in the next few weeks. Speaking to Robinhood’s crypto lead Christine Brown, she says the company will take the alpha users’ feedback and address it publicly (meaning on Twitter and its blog). She says people on the waitlist will start getting access to wallets by the end of 2021 and that Robinhood’s crypto wallets will be generally available in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q23CI2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll have to join a waitlist if you want to be one of the first to store your crypto with Robinhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOqL5"&gt;Wallets have been a popular request from community members who feel like buying cryptocurrencies on Robinhood doesn’t really let them &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; crypto (for example, you currently can’t use your Ethereum holdings in the app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;buy an NFT&lt;/a&gt;). While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undefined/comments/mz86sx/comment/gw2jyps/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Robinhood has said&lt;/a&gt; that buying one Bitcoin on its platform means that the company goes and buys one Bitcoin, then stores it in a wallet, some users argue that not being able to use it themselves defeats the purpose. Storing crypto in a wallet that the user can access allows users to transfer or spend the coins without converting them into another currency first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIUTAF"&gt;Robinhood’s wallet will initially only support holding the coins Robinhood Crypto supports, covering major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and (yes, I’m counting it) Dogecoin. Brown tells me the company is looking to expand the currencies available on its platform in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV5LHS"&gt;In August, the company’s CEO &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/78903/robinhood-crypot-wallet"&gt;promised that wallets would be coming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf"&gt;said that the company wanted&lt;/a&gt; its security to be “bulletproof.” Robinhood now says that wallets will have identity verification and multifactor authentication (which will sometimes include asking for a picture of your ID or a selfie to ensure that it’s actually you trying to carry out a transaction), as well as email and phone verification. The company is trying to walk a line, though, between security and customer experience. At this point, stories about people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;losing millions of dollars because they forgot their wallet’s password&lt;/a&gt; are well known, and Robinhood doesn’t want to show up in similar headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ry48Ok"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood manages your wallet for you, rather than giving you direct control over its keys&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWnTbb"&gt;The concerns about security versus user experience were part of the reason why Robinhood decided to make its wallets &lt;a href="https://phemex.com/academy/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-wallets"&gt;custodial&lt;/a&gt;, Brown tells me. The company will be responsible for the keys used to unlock your wallet instead of managing it yourself. It means giving up some level of control (which you’re entrusting to Robinhood), but it also takes away a lot of responsibility. However, Robinhood says that you’ll be able to move crypto purchased on the platform into other wallets if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsE5WU"&gt;If you’ve been pining for wallets, you’ll want to get in line using Robinhood’s waitlist. The plan is to let “super eager” people earn a jump in line if they refer Robinhood to a friend. For example, if you’re number 1,000 on the waitlist, you can become number 500 if a friend signs up (and number 250 if you convince another friend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gOI1qM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wallets make Robinhood’s cryptocurrencies more currency-like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgJ65D"&gt;Brown says she hopes Robinhood introducing wallets will open the door for many people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;using the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Until now, it seems like Robinhood has treated cryptocurrency mostly like a stock. With wallets, it’s starting to treat it like a currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLmilg"&gt;In addition to wallets, Robinhood also says that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663251/robinhood-cryptocurrency-recurring-investment-dollar-cost-averaging-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;recurring crypto investments it announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; are now available to all its users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford will recycle its EV batteries with ex-Tesla exec’s startup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTZ0-uW-KEmghC7TrfU-rl6X_D0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892377/sokane_210125_4386_1789_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="in0zAd"&gt;Ford has tapped startup Redwood Materials — run by former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel — to handle the recycling of its electric vehicle batteries. The two companies also plan to use this new partnership to help build out the battery supply chain in the United States, which is something that the Biden administration has stressed as a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0snfdt"&gt;As part of the deal, Ford is investing $50 million into Redwood Materials, which Straubel said is part of the startup’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"&gt;recently announced $700 million funding round&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcqPEh"&gt;This is not the first customer Redwood Materials has lined up — Straubel’s startup already recycles batteries from Nissan, Specialized (which has an increasing number of e-bike batteries), and scrap from Tesla and Panasonic at the original Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada. (Redwood Materials is headquartered just south of the factory in Carson City.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="527YXv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford invested $50 million in the startup, which just raised $700 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pzLrLB"&gt;But with Ford, Redwood Materials is looking to be more deeply integrated than just a recycling partner. Straubel’s startup is working with the Detroit automaker to figure out plans for everything from helping to process scrap material, to finding new life for worn-down batteries with ample capacity remaining, to helping Ford create new batteries out of salvaged lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPA1j2"&gt;The companies were light on specifics, but the overarching goal is one that Straubel has talked about frequently since founding Redwood Materials. The idea is to create a “circular” or “closed loop” system where the stuff that makes up lithium-ion batteries gets recycled and reused, which could theoretically drive down the cost of an EV’s battery while reducing the automaker’s reliance on imported materials and (one day) mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uYNeCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford teams up with South Korea’s SK Innovation to build EV batteries in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uDFeC1"&gt;The deal with Ford could provide a lot of opportunity for Redwood Materials to work all that out. Like many of its competitors, Ford is now deeply committed to electric vehicles. It released the Mustang Mach-E earlier this year and has an all-electric version of its F-150 coming in 2022, and those are just the first two flagships of an impending fleet of EVs coming from the automaker in the next decade. As part of that push, Ford is also planning to build batteries with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;South Korea’s SK Innovation in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYF4pn"&gt;Ford’s not alone, though. General Motors — which is also in the midst of a massive push into electric vehicles — recently &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/"&gt;tapped Canadian company Li-Cycle&lt;/a&gt; to recycle the scrap waste from the batteries it’s going to make with SK Innovation’s rival, LG Chem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rad Power Bikes’ new RadCity e-bike makes commuting (and hill climbing) much easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZOdFszHyomCTyBxFQ0GxAHfta0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892265/ahawkins_210914_4767_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QUJke"&gt;Rad Power Bikes’ electric commuting bike, the RadCity, is getting a serious makeover. The Seattle-based company has completely redesigned the bike’s powertrain, including a semi-integrated battery, and made a number of other upgrades to make riding easier, faster, and more intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRiSDS"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is the second bike in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to receive many of these design updates, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22583925/radrover-rad-power-bikes-integrated-battery-price"&gt;the flagship RadRover fat-tire bike&lt;/a&gt;. It shows how Rad Power Bikes is evolving as it settles into its position as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;the number one e-bike manufacturer in North America&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GOH9k5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="03jPyf"&gt;Rad Power Bikes says the new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster than the previous generation. The bike’s range has also been improved by 11 percent, thanks to custom-made tires that operate more efficiently on paved roads. But the range estimate is &lt;a href="https://electricbikereview.com/rad-power-bikes/radcity/"&gt;the same as the fourth-generation version of the bike&lt;/a&gt;, where, depending on your level of assist, Rad says you’ll get between 28–50 miles of range. And the stopping power has been improved with the inclusion of hydraulic disc brakes with long-lasting ceramic pads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlsEiLA0Pek4gpEp7Jhz04d0ohk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867691/ahawkins_210914_4767_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dr2oYw"&gt;Last week, I got a chance to test out the new RadCity with Redwood Stephens, chief product officer at Rad Power Bikes. Before taking the bikes for a leisurely ride around Central Park, he told me how the company’s engineering team approached the challenge of squeezing more power out of the bike’s battery and motor. Much of what was accomplished derived from a successful pairing between the bike’s motor and its speed controller, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xljWyz"&gt;“Our engineering team has spent a lot of time dialing in on the user interface, the programming at each pedal assist level, the programming on the throttle, and really getting that controller-motor pairing to be ultra-efficient,” Stephens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nUrkgZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSLQ50"&gt;That efficiency shines through on the pavement, where the RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride. The motor is noticeably quieter than Rad’s older models, but it isn’t nearly silent like some of the newer Bosch motors tend to be. But the new geared hub motor (rated for 750W, like all of Rad’s bikes) has a lot more pick-me-up than the previous generation model’s gearless motors. Geared hub motors are slightly heavier than gearless motors, but not so much that you compromise on range. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgYNbBAZcRxQu9jhpLv-kA7Mytg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867692/ahawkins_210914_4767_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UMrk2M"&gt;The cockpit of the bike is also redesigned, with two displays rather than just one. The square-shaped display in the center of the handlebars shows real-time stats, like speed, power output, and trip time. A smaller display on the left features a big orange power button and two even bigger up and down arrow buttons for toggling between power settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAN2d"&gt;Rather than integrate the wires in the frame of the bike, Rad is sticking with the rats nest look, which Stephens says helps with maintenance and repair issues. It can also be useful when selling the bike in markets with different regulations. For example, the throttle can be disconnected if the bike is sold in a country that prohibits throttles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNowpv"&gt;Speaking of different markets, the RadCity 5 Plus will be the commuter bike’s debut in the European market, where Rad has recently started selling its bikes. Europe is going to be a bigger focus for Rad Power Bikes, with the company seeing “triple-digit” sales growth there year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ZUB6h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10766131"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YI3rCK"&gt;The semi-integrated battery is still removable, which, in my opinion, is preferable compared to fully integrated, non-removable batteries. While some of the battery is still sticking out, it’s not as unsightly as the external batteries in Rad’s older models. And the ability to leave your heavy bike outside while you bring the battery indoors for charging can’t be underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92vlEQ"&gt;For the first time, the RadCity will be offered in two frame sizes: a high-step model and a step-through one. Being able to appeal to a wider range of riders — including older customers, people with knee issues, and others who would prefer not to have to swing their leg over a top tube — is key feature in the new RadCity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0kxaj"&gt;It’s exciting to see a company like Rad Power Bikes take what works about its bikes and make them better, while also introducing new ideas and new designs. Rad will need to continue to innovate as e-bike sales continue to grow, incumbent bike makers roll out their own designs, and rival direct-to-consumer brands release newer, more powerful bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BYxHx"&gt;There is a lot of money flowing into this space right now, and talk of tax breaks for consumers will certainly fuel even more hype and investment in the future. Rad Power Bikes has captured the top spot with a simple but well-designed lineup of powerful and affordable e-bikes. And with the new and improved RadCity, the company is proving that it’s not content to rest on its laurels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onmgkh"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is available for preorder online starting on September 22nd for the US price of $1,799, and it will be coming to Europe in the winter of 2021–2022 for €1,799.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRz1sLgtNeEgq2XaIUYSqOV0FuE=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892225/VRG_ILLO_4756_Student_Professor_Folders_Lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A generation that grew up with Google is forcing professors to rethink their lesson plans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1PTaTy"&gt;Catherine Garland, an astrophysicist, started seeing the problem in 2017. She was teaching an engineering course, and her students were using simulation software to model turbines for jet engines. She’d laid out the assignment clearly, but student after student was calling her over for help. They were all getting the same error message: The program couldn’t find their files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPxjeh"&gt;Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each student where they’d saved their project. Could they be on the desktop? Perhaps in the shared drive? But over and over, she was met with confusion. “What are you talking about?” multiple students inquired. Not only did they not know where their files were saved — they didn’t understand the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhPrjh"&gt;Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of her fellow educators have reached in the past four years: the concept of file folders and directories, essential to previous generations’ understanding of computers, is gibberish to many modern students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FVR1bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvQTA4"&gt;Professors have varied recollections of when they first saw the disconnect. But their estimates (even the most tentative ones) are surprisingly similar. It’s been an issue for four years or so, starting — for many educators — around the fall of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hP408s"&gt;That’s approximately when Lincoln Colling, a lecturer in the psychology department at the University of Sussex, told a class full of research students to pull a file out of a specific directory and was met with blank stares. It was the same semester that Nicolás Guarín-Zapata, an applied physicist and lecturer at Colombia’s Universidad EAFIT, noticed that students in his classes were having trouble finding their documents. It’s the same year that &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3535/introducing-file-systems-to-students-who-really-dont-understand?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1"&gt;posts began to pop up on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1"&gt;STEM-educator forums&lt;/a&gt; asking for help explaining the concept of a file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPGgHV"&gt;Guarín-Zapata is an organizer. He has an intricate hierarchy of file folders on his computer, and he sorts the photos on his smartphone by category. He was in college in the very early 2000s — he grew up needing to keep papers organized. Now, he thinks of his hard drives like filing cabinets. “I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Like a nested structure. At the very end, I have a folder or a piece of paper I can access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pS7YVC"&gt;Guarín-Zapata’s mental model is commonly known as directory structure, the hierarchical system of folders that modern computer operating systems use to arrange files. It’s the idea that a modern computer doesn’t just save a file in an infinite expanse; it saves it in the “Downloads” folder, the “Desktop” folder, or the “Documents” folder, all of which live within “This PC,” and each of which might have folders nested within them, too. It’s an idea that’s likely intuitive to any computer user who remembers the floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIU14w"&gt;More broadly, directory structure connotes physical placement — the idea that a file stored on a computer is &lt;em&gt;located&lt;/em&gt; somewhere on that computer, in a specific and discrete location. That’s a concept that’s always felt obvious to Garland but seems completely alien to her students. “I tend to think an item lives in a particular folder. It lives in one place, and I have to go to that folder to find it,” Garland says. “They see it like one bucket, and everything’s in the bucket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DJXg5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp8s6S"&gt;That tracks with how Joshua Drossman, a senior at Princeton, has understood computer systems for as long as he can remember. “The most intuitive thing would be the laundry basket where you have everything kind of together, and you’re just kind of pulling out what you need at any given time,” he says, attempting to describe his mental model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXXkav"&gt;As an operations research and financial engineering major, Drossman knows how to program — he’s been trained to navigate directories and folders throughout his undergraduate years, and he understands their importance in his field. But it’s still not entirely natural, and he sometimes slips. About halfway through a recent nine-month research project, he’d built up so many files that he gave up on keeping them all structured. “I try to be organized, but there’s a certain point where there are so many files that it kind of just became a hot mess,” Drossman says. Many of his items ended up in one massive folder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCF1tz"&gt;Peter Plavchan, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason University, has seen similar behavior from his students and can’t quite wrap his head around it. “Students have had these computers in my lab; they’ll have a thousand files on their desktop completely unorganized,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, somewhat incredulously. “I’m kind of an obsessive organizer ... but they have no problem having 1,000 files in the same directory. And I think that is fundamentally because of a shift in how we access files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR9cMa"&gt;Aubrey Vogel, a journalism major at Texas A&amp;amp;M, has had similar experiences to Drossman. She’s encountered directory structure before; she shared a computer with her grandfather, who showed her how to save items in folders, as a child. But as she’s grown up, she’s moved away from that system — she now keeps one massive directory for schoolwork and one for her job. Documents she’s not sure about go in a third folder called “Sort.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFii3X"&gt;“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess,” Vogel says of her files. She adds, “My family always gives me a hard time when they see my computer screen, and it has like 50 thousand icons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Fl2oF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2017’s college freshmen were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; they’re around the same age as Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RltPyI"&gt;Why have mental models changed? Drossman, for his part, has no idea. “I don’t think I even thought about it at all when I first started using computers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrhK3S"&gt;It’s possible that the analogy multiple professors pointed to — filing cabinets — is no longer useful since many students Drossman’s age spent their high school years storing documents in the likes of OneDrive and Dropbox rather than in physical spaces. It could also have to do with the other software they’re accustomed to — dominant smartphone apps like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube all involve pulling content from a vast online sea rather than locating it within a nested hierarchy. “When I want to scroll over to Snapchat, Twitter, they’re not in any particular order, but I know exactly where they are,” says Vogel, who is a devoted iPhone user. Some of it boils down to muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi34VS"&gt;But it may also be that in an age where every conceivable user interface includes a search function, young people have never needed folders or directories for the tasks they do. The first internet search engines were used &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/first-search-engine-archie"&gt;around 1990&lt;/a&gt;, but features like Windows Search and Spotlight on macOS are both products of the early 2000s. Most of 2017’s college freshmen were born in the very late ‘90s. They were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones"&gt;they’re around the same age as Google&lt;/a&gt;. While many of today’s professors grew up without search functions on their phones and computers, today’s students increasingly don’t remember a world without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsmw9E2CS-9tvAZd6Gf17RtlZmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864732/VRG_ILLO_4756_Student_Professor_Folders_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O6J7za"&gt;“I grew up when you had to have a file; you had to save it; you had to know where it was saved. There was no search function,” says Saavik Ford, a professor of astronomy at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. But among her students, “There’s not a conception that there’s a place where files live. They just search for it and bring it up.” She added, “They have a laundry basket full of laundry, and they have a robot who will fetch them every piece of clothing they want on demand.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171441/foldimate-laundry-folding-robot-ces-2019"&gt;Some companies&lt;/a&gt; have actually played around with laundry-inclined robots, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512529/laundroid-laundry-folding-robot-seven-dreamers-bankrupt-ces"&gt;to little result&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZOONb"&gt;To a point, the new mindset may reflect a natural — and expected — technological progression. Plavchan recalls having similar disconnects with his own professors. “When I was a student, I’m sure there was a professor that said, ‘Oh my god, I don’t understand how this person doesn’t know how to solder a chip on a motherboard,’” he says. “This kind of generational issue has always been around.” And though directory structures exist on every computer (as well as in environments like Google Drive), today’s iterations of macOS and Windows do an excellent job of hiding them. (Your Steam games all live in a folder called “steamapps” — when was the last time you clicked on that?) Today’s virtual world is largely a searchable one; people in many modern professions have little need to interact with nested hierarchies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ae1D8f"&gt;But in STEM fields, directory structure remains crucially important. Astronomers, for example, may work with hundreds of thousands of files in the same format — which can be unwieldy to scale to a searchable system, Plavchan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsQLiN"&gt;The primary issue is that the code researchers write, run at the command line, needs to be told exactly how to access the files it’s working with — it can’t search for those files on its own. Some programming languages have search functions, but they’re difficult to implement and not commonly used. It’s in the programming lessons where STEM professors, across fields, are encountering problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EMNMHJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way. That’s where the problem is starting.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utahap"&gt;Classes in high school computer science — that is, programming — are &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-do-we-know-about-the-expansion-of-k-12-computer-science-education/"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; globally. But that hasn’t translated to better preparation for college coursework in every case. Guarín-Zapata was taught computer basics in high school — how to save, how to use file folders, how to navigate the terminal — which is knowledge many of his current students are coming in without. The high school students Garland works with largely haven’t encountered directory structure unless they’ve taken upper-level STEM courses. Vogel recalls saving to file folders in a first-grade computer class, but says she was never directly taught what folders were — those sorts of lessons have taken a backseat amid a growing emphasis on&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/keyword/21st-century+Skills"&gt; “21st-century skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745499919829214"&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; in the educational space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlPFtO"&gt;A cynic could blame generational incompetence. An &lt;a href="https://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/2020-04/IEA%20International%20Computer%20and%20Information%20Literacy%20Study%202018%20International%20Report.pdf"&gt;international 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that measured eighth-graders’ “capacities to use information and computer technologies productively” proclaimed that just 2 percent of Gen Z had achieved the highest “digital native” tier of computer literacy. “Our students are in deep trouble,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/todays-kids-may-be-digital-natives-new-study-shows-they-arent-close-being-computer-literate/"&gt;one educator wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFaf2"&gt;But the issue is likely not that modern students are learning fewer digital skills, but rather that they’re learning different ones. Guarín-Zapata, for all his knowledge of directory structure, doesn’t understand Instagram nearly as well as his students do, despite having had an account for a year. He’s had students try to explain the app in detail, but “I still can’t figure it out,” he complains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo2NuV"&gt;“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way,” Guarin-Zapata emphasizes. “That’s where the problem is starting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZMsRb"&gt;Ford agrees. “These are smart kids,” she says. “They’re doing astrophysics. They get stuff. But they were not getting this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni92sJ"&gt;Regardless of source, the consequence is clear. STEM educators are increasingly taking on dual roles: those of instructors not only in their field of expertise but in computer fundamentals as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqbHXN"&gt;Colling’s courses now include a full two-hour lecture to explain directory structure. He likens finding files to giving driving directions. He shows maps of directory trees and asks his students to pretend they’re guiding others to a highlighted point. He uses every analogy he can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Ix4AAS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEtYGX"&gt;Plavchan now also spends a lot of time teaching his students about directory structure in his courses, along with other basics, like file extensions and terminal navigation. Guarín-Zapata begins his semesters with a similar tutorial. “I start with a little talk about a mental model of a computer, what a computer is,” he says. “We have memory; we have a hard drive; we have an interface; we have a file structure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z1q5Z"&gt;It’s a difficult concept to get across, though. Directory structure isn’t just unintuitive to students — it’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; intuitive to professors that they have difficulty figuring out how to explain it. “Those of us who have been around a while &lt;em&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;what a file is, but I was at a bit of a loss to explain it,” lamented one educator in &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1"&gt;a 2019 forum post&lt;/a&gt;, a sentiment that respondents shared. Ford put out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saavikford/status/1425235203308535808"&gt;call for useful analogies&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and was met with various suggestions: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PrieneV/status/1425442829598445569"&gt;physical tree branches and leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/akiroberge/status/1425494357600317448"&gt;kitchen utensils sorted into drawers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markmadsen/status/1425502956825178115"&gt;books and shelves in a library&lt;/a&gt;, “Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYm0l0"&gt;But even after presenting students with every metaphor in the books, Colling still isn’t positive that his students get what he’s talking about: “It feels like I’m having some success, but yeah, sometimes it’s hard to tell,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCke1I"&gt;Plavchan agrees that there are limits to how much he can bridge the generational divide. Despite his efforts to tailor his teaching, “some of the tools we use rely on some knowledge that our students just aren’t getting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVJ4Sq"&gt;Others, meanwhile, believe it’s professors who need to adjust their thinking. Working with befuddled students has convinced Garland that the “laundry basket” may be a superior model. She’s begun to see the limitations of directory structure in her personal life; she uses her computer’s search function to find her schedules and documents when she’s lost them in her stack of directories. “I’m like, huh ... I don’t even need these subfolders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l72n7v"&gt;Even professors who have incorporated directory structure into their courses suspect that they may be clinging to an approach that’s soon to be obsolete. Plavchan has considered offering a separate course on directory structure — but he’s not sure it’s worth it. “I imagine what’s going to happen is our generation of students ... they’re going to grow up and become professors, they’re going to write their own tools, and they’re going to be based on a completely different approach from what we use today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DeTDMa"&gt;His advice to fellow educators: Get ready. “This is not gonna go away,” he says. “You’re not gonna go back to the way things were. You have to accept it. The sooner that you accept that things change, the better.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new 11-inch tablet has a flipping webcam  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kt0pm1ihneDs4kgB6RT0N8hyXkU=/0x0:1879x1253/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892207/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s 11-inch tablet also includes stylus support.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqfoqT"&gt;HP has announced a new 11-inch tablet that appears to be a more or less direct competitor to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt;, with a couple of interesting tricks. For starters, its 13-megapixel rear facing camera can flip around the short edge of the display to work as a webcam, which HP claims is a first for a tablet, and also makes it the highest resolution front-facing camera to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrUyLM"&gt;It’s also able to work with its keyboard accessory in either portrait or landscape modes: Handy, since in landscape mode its webcam is on the wrong edge of its 2160 x 1440 IPS display. As well as the keyboard, the tablet also works with HP’s Tilt Pen, and there’s a USB-C port for plugging in more accessories as well as charging, alongside a microSD card slot and a fingerprint reader built into its power button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuGa-rsxSnIyTnpvvlqyUDRItZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869417/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13-megapixel sensor works as either a webcam or a rear-facing camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjSuPhL4xnC6gv1_WNU8jCyq32o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869418/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_TwillGray_Portrait_T_HDcam_nonODD_nonFPR_Win11_CoreSet_FrontRight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet in portrait mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nlBtCd"&gt;Internally, the tablet is available with an Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of NVMe storage. Its modest specs mean that it’s running Windows 11’s lightweight S mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkw3Dp"&gt;HP plans to eventually sell the tablet both with and without the keyboard when it goes on sale in December. It’ll start at $499 alone, or $599 with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Surface event today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8CAc52AX9dhUytzuOgLyInbrUyo=/200x0:2333x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892135/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.48.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfr0cq"&gt;Microsoft is holding an online hardware event on Wednesday, September 22nd, at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;expected to announce&lt;/a&gt; redesigned Surface tablets and laptops (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;potentially a new phone&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will be covering any announcements from the event and running a world-class live blog, and here’s how you can watch along with us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKM4HQ"&gt;It’s simple: Microsoft will have a livestream &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the events page of its website&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll also be able to watch it on on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/surface/status/1435618941473148938"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;@verge on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to see news from the event as it happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIayK4"&gt;Looming over the event is the upcoming release of Windows 11, which will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;coming out on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s almost a given that anything Microsoft announces at Wednesday’s event will be running the new OS, it will be interesting if the rumors about Microsoft releasing a new version of its Arm-based Surface Pro X tablet are true. We don’t have a very clear picture of how Windows 11 will pair with Microsoft’s long-running Arm computing ambitions — and a new computer, perhaps one with a new Microsoft-designed chip, could be a great time for the company to talk about the future of Windows outside of Intel, AMD, and x86 in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmbhw0"&gt;There are also likely to be some traditional x86 computers shown off at the event, with rumors suggesting that we’ll see a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 tablet&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;Surface Book laptop&lt;/a&gt;, and an updated &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-go-3"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683595/microsoft-surface-duo-2-fcc-5g-nfc-wireless-charging-support-features"&gt;the real possibility&lt;/a&gt; we’ll see a follow-up to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo folding phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kh4Oxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Surface event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VCm1Z5"&gt;But, if you're listening, Microsoft, I’d really like to see a version of the beautiful &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-ergonomic-keyboard%2F90pnc9ljwpx9%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Ergonomic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, this time one without a number pad to get in the way of mousing. Your other keyboard, the Sculpt Ergonomic, is just not terribly well-built, and I’d prefer Bluetooth to a USB dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5e9Ep"&gt;To see the news as it happens on Wednesday morning, stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and head to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s website to see the stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gitamini is a cute, compact, cargo-carrying robot that will follow you around like a dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXy-B0D4yQrpZ6xzLmPPBma6J-8=/0x0:6582x4388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892140/459_GitaStudio_Lifestyles_167_edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gitamini uses machine vision and AI to follow its owner. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Piaggio Fast Forward&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4avhGt"&gt;Piaggio Fast Forward, a subsidiary of storied Italian automotive firm Piaggio, has launched its second robot, a compact version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20897348/piaggio-vespa-gita-cargo-robot"&gt;cargo-carrying bot Gita&lt;/a&gt; named Gitamini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge34FS"&gt;The form and function of Gitamini remain the same as that of full-sized Gita (the name is Italian for a small trip or outing). The robot consists of two large wheels, a central trunk, and a machine vision system that it uses to identify and follow its owner. Gitamini weighs 28 pounds and can carry up to 20 pounds in its interior for 21 miles. That makes an interesting comparison to Gita, which can carry more — 40 pounds but only for 12 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5QaSJ"&gt;Gitamini uses an array of cameras and sensors, including radar (not available for the original Gita), to navigate and follow its user. To activate this follow mode, you simply stand in front of the Gitamini and tap a pairing button. The robot will then lock on to you using vision only (no GPS or Bluetooth are utilized) and will follow you at speeds of up to 6mph. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-uTgPX9oYxBqARsdC1emn5ymR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867230/459_GitaStudio_Lifestyles_31_edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Piaggio Fast Forward&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Gita (left) and new Gitamini (right). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0G0KYl"&gt;The robot’s trunk can be locked and its follow mode disabled, but there are no active theft mitigation features. When asked about this, Piaggio Fast Forward’s CEO Greg Lynn told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “unlikely someone could get away with walking away with it unnoticed” as it’s such a noticeable object. “A stolen Gita isn’t of much use to anyone as it uses a secure connection to a phone to be unlocked, updated, and used,” says Lynn. “We have yet to learn of a Gita being stolen or broken into while being used or when parked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r5lAd"&gt;The Gita has always been a bit of an odd product. It certainly looks fantastic, and videos &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2DaDnC-uhHM"&gt;suggest it works more or less as advertised&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s noisier than you might expect). But it’s not clear exactly who’s going to spend thousands of dollars on something that only carries a few bags and is stymied by steps and stairs. Gitamini doesn’t change any of these basic annoyances, though it is at least a little cheaper — it costs $1,850 (and will be available to buy from October 15th at &lt;a href="http://mygita.com/"&gt;mygita.com&lt;/a&gt;) while the launch sees the price of the original Gita drop to $2,950. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vndv3Y"&gt;When we asked CEO Greg Lynn about the robot, he declined to share any sales figures with us but said there were Gita robots operating in “half the states in the US [...] with a focus on the Southern belt where outdoor weather is more friendly year-round.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgoVg3"&gt;“Most of the consumer Gitas are being used to replace car trips for neighborhood errands in a variety of communities, and they are used outdoors for round trips of a mile or more,” said Lynn. Though, he noted that the company had some business customers, too. There are currently Gitas in eight airports in the US (including JFK and LAX) and a number more in planned communities, like Water Street Tampa in Florida and Ontario Ranch in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5BXN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
