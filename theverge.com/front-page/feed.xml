    <title>Instagram is adding easier access to support for eating disorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_w6D3siTxvbbbI3LesAdNkogig=/19x0:1381x908/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857097/151612295_1895260083948087_6213885929941207150_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbRXrn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-were-supporting-people-affected-by-eating-disorders-and-negative-body-image"&gt;Instagram is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adding resources for people affected by eating disorders to its social platform. If users search for hashtags or content that’s potentially related to disordered eating, the company will guide that user to resources or help lines provided by the National Eating Disorders Association (or NEDA) in the US, as well as others in the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2QgtSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOFQUX"&gt;Instagram says that currently, it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/188848648282410"&gt;tries to blur out potentially triggering content&lt;/a&gt; in search results, and it does direct people to generalized crisis support, but it should now direct users to resources specifically designed around eating disorders. In its blog, Instagram also says that it plans to show the resources if someone is trying to share eating disorder-related content, or “if a friend is concerned about something they see posted and wants to offer support.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH8Es5"&gt;This update is similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292166/tiktok-eating-disorder-support-resources-hashtags"&gt;to what TikTok announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear as if Instagram pointed to eating disorder-specific resources before, though they were shown in the general list of help lines. Currently, searching for content related to eating disorders will bring you to that general help line list, which not only includes NEDA but the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Veterans Crisis Line, and Trevor Project as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I5CDjDHA7KMBCb_LDdLkTbCG5sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320938/IMG_0876.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, the list doesn’t surface eating disorder help lines, even if that’s the type of content from which the user was directed to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AOFLXa"&gt;However, Instagram’s screenshots imply that the support button will specifically point out the NEDA contacts to people, rather than just showing them the whole list of available help lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4WYZC"&gt;As part of its National Eating Disorders Awareness Week programing, the company also says it’s planning to work with community leaders to publish Reels that “encourage positive body image, push back against weight stigma and harmful stereotypes, and show that all bodies are worthy and deserve to be celebrated.” According to the post, this is the third time that Instagram has worked on content for NEDA week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z3KWy"&gt;Instagram has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47637377"&gt;had issues in the past&lt;/a&gt; trying to regulate eating disorder content, and the social network is often brought up in conversations about negative body image and perception, especially among young people. While the higher resource prioritization likely won’t do much to help with self-esteem issues after using the site, it should help people who are struggling and vulnerable get easier access to help from experts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch new dramatic videos from NASA’s Perseverance rover landing on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_AMh9FDlcU6RtBJ9iNHlXYx5oo=/0x7:430x294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856936/mars_landing_perseverence3.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntv99t"&gt;NASA on Monday released a trove of video footage showing its Perseverance rover landing on Mars after plunging through the planet’s atmosphere, unveiling the most in-depth views of a Mars landing ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tVfSIB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your front-row seat to my Mars landing is here. Watch how we did it.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Avv13dSVmQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Avv13dSVmQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363929492138254340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O8o8pR"&gt;Mission teams at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California got back 30 gigabytes of data and over 23,000 images of the vehicle descending down to the surface. The videos were among 4,500 images NASA planned to release on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LttMvd"&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;entered Mars’ atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; last week bundled with a protective shell and a descent stage called the “Skycrane,” which fired rocket thrusters to slow its descent near the surface. The bundle sported four cameras to capture the landing sequence: one fixed on its protective backshell facing upward, one on the descent stage, and two on each side of the rover. Together, they captured some incredible views of the spacecraft’s descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HnAwP"&gt;“I can watch these videos for hours, and keep seeing new stuff every time,” Allen Chen, the mission’s entry, landing, and descent lead, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mltrl"&gt;Imaging company FLIR provided the four cameras, and NASA made little to no modifications to them. “You can purchase the same camera off the internet,” Dave Gruel, lead engineer for Mars 2020’s EDL Camera system said at the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rwH2F1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now that you’ve seen Mars, hear it. Grab some headphones and listen to the first sounds captured by one of my microphones.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP"&gt;https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363937472971907072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PljiLQ"&gt;A microphone onboard Perseverance also captured sounds once the rover was on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSHHfZ"&gt;The data started coming through NASA’s Deep Space Network last Thursday and Friday as the team pored over data on the spacecraft’s health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxEFl4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LIDAR maker Velodyne boots its founder after an investigation into ‘inappropriate’ behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yandex NV Trials Driverless Taxis" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvHocOCjEYsr94M-JX58RoBjlsg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856898/1164317768.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YyAi76"&gt;Velodyne, which makes LIDAR sensors crucial for the operation of autonomous vehicles, has removed its founder, David Hall, as chair of the company’s board following an investigation, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. Hall’s wife, Marta Thoma Hall, has also stepped down as chief marketing officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSRIC3"&gt;The investigation, which started in December 2020, concluded that the Halls “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeePbf"&gt;David Hall had previously stepped down as chairman of the board “voluntarily,” the board said, and transitioned to a new role as executive chairman. Marta Hall was terminated as an employee of the company but will remain a member of the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02nxsY"&gt;“The Board also formally censured both Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall, and directed them both to receive appropriate remedial training,” the company said. It is unclear what behavior proceeded this decision. A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further comment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apSl5d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“formally censured”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyDtQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview"&gt;David Hall has long been revered in the world of autonomous vehicle technology&lt;/a&gt; as a pioneer in the use of laser sensors to enable AVs to “see” the world around them. LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses thousands of laser beams to sense objects and measure their distance. The cone- or cylindrical-shaped sensor perched on the roof of a vehicle has become synonymous with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdqbvl"&gt;Ford was an early backer of Velodyne, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12499622/ford-baidu-velodyne-investment"&gt;investing $150 million&lt;/a&gt; in the company in 2017 along with Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Ford contributed $75 million of that total and held 13.1 million shares in the company. But the automaker abruptly dissolved its stake in the LIDAR company earlier this month and noted in a regulatory filing that it would no longer be a customer for Velodyne’s sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJe7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020"&gt;Hall stepped down as CEO of Velodyne in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Anand Gopalan. But he remained chairman of the board, steering the company’s major financial decisions, until earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQkauc"&gt;Last summer, Velodyne became the latest mobility technology company to go public via a reverse merger, or SPAC. The company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karma’s new GS-6 hybrid is a cheaper version of its luxury sports car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiZGZKr7qeYcID8bLYUK3HIsz7M=/17x0:2024x1338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856845/GS6__6_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Karma Automotive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u3HwHX"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Karma Automotive has fully revealed its newest hybrid car, the GS-6. While it shares the same design as the company’s ultra-luxury sedan, the Revero GT, Karma is pricing the GS-6 at nearly half the price — $83,900 — in a bid to reach a much wider set of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydo9r0"&gt;Karma says it’s able to do that because it plans to make more cars at its California production plant, is making them more efficiently, and has streamlined its supply chain, according director of public relations Jeff Holland. “It helps that our parent company also owns our battery supplier A123 Systems, but over the past few years we have also seen a substantial reduction in the cost of lithium ion batteries and other EV-related components including other items such as motors and generators,” Holland told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Gzzt2"&gt;If the new car is successful, Karma could finally realize its goal of becoming a small-volume manufacturer just in time to capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;a new wave of optimism (and funding) in the electric vehicle space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEKXYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost half the price of the Revero, but mostly the same car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMw5CE"&gt;The path to that goal has been difficult so far for Karma. The startup was born in 2014 when Chinese automotive conglomerate Wanxiang Group bought a bulk of the assets of Fisker Automotive following &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company’s bankruptcy. Wanxiang named the new startup after the Fisker Karma, the defunct company’s failed hybrid sports car, and ultimately revived that vehicle as the Revero. (Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker Automotive, now has a new company called Fisker Inc. that is also working on electric vehicles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LiRUqV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10355814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Llh3uy"&gt;Karma has spent the last few years selling a small number of Revero hybrids for nearly $150,000 while struggling to really get on its feet as Wanxiang allegedly waffled on fully backing the startup, as &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Torchinsky has reported. The startup has been &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/source-claims-that-karma-will-layoff-most-workers-and-s-1842985031"&gt;accused of making prototypes that are basically just “movie props,”&lt;/a&gt; and may have even &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/karma-was-reportedly-considering-chapter-11-sources-up-1844136394"&gt;considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year&lt;/a&gt;. (Karma has denied both claims.) Karma has also laid off more than one hundred employees over the last two years and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314730/byton-lordstown-karma-ppp-loans-coronavirus-bailout-layoffs"&gt;took a PPP loan of more than $5 million&lt;/a&gt; from the government in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBREGp"&gt;The GS-6 is meant to help lift Karma out of that turmoil by appealing to a potentially much bigger group of buyers. It’s powered by a BMW-sourced, turbocharged three-cylinder engine and two electric motors that, altogether, generate a total of about 536 horsepower — the same powertrain found in the Revero. A 28kWh battery pack allows for up to 80 miles of driving on electricity alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsDJIT"&gt;The interior features a touchscreen in the center of the dashboard, which is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a digital instrument cluster for the driver. Karma says it’s sourcing a lot of sustainable materials for the trim and the seats, too, in an attempt to appeal to more conscientious buyers. Karma will sell a Sport and a Luxury trim of the GS-6, and an all-electric version (dubbed GSe-6) is due out later starting at $79,900. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="snMAnM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbfR7T"&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars,” Joost de Vries, Karma’s vice president of global sales, said on a conference call with reporters last week. de Vries explained that Karma hopes to target younger buyers with the lower price point, and more of them, too, with a total production capacity of 15,000 cars per year at the California factory. That said, de Vries was quick to point out that the startup has retained many of its older, existing customers whose Revero leases have expired. Karma is “starting to really feel like a more complete auto manufacturer here in the US,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeSMS8"&gt;While Karma has spent time and money developing autonomous technology (it even &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-debuts-all-new-level-4-autonomous-van-e-flex-platform/"&gt;created an allegedly self-driving van last year&lt;/a&gt;), de Vries said that’s not expected to come to the startup’s passenger vehicles any time soon. The GS-6 lineup will have optional driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, but nothing more. “We’re not seeing anything in our near future on level three or level four,” de Vries said, referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ designations for hands-free driving and fully driverless capability within a certain area, respectively. “It’s on the roadmap, but I think we still want to wait another decade or so before the legislative problems have been resolved, and our customers are really not asking for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeibFP"&gt;Karma has a hand in a lot of other advanced technologies, too. The startup has shared that it’s working on a way to &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131161_karma-will-test-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car-without-the-infrastructure-hurdles"&gt;use methanol and hydrogen fuel cells to power future electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-completes-e-flex-platform-projects-to-offer-new-electric-mobility-solutions/"&gt;hopes to sell the technological platform that powers its cars to other automakers&lt;/a&gt;. An SUV is in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apKNDd"&gt;To fund all of this, Karma announced last July that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21319273/fisker-inc-karma-automotive-fundraising-public-evs-tesla-nikola"&gt;had raised a fresh $100 million&lt;/a&gt;. That announcement came at the beginning of a wave of electric vehicle companies going public by merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt; (including Fisker Inc.). But so far, Karma remains private. “Our management team is exploring all avenues for a larger financing with investment bankers. And of course, IPO has always been an aspiration for Karma when it is public company ready, but for now the key focus is on growing our business,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim tops 500,000 simultaneous players, breaking four more records</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s8EhFA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; is on a trajectory like nothing we’ve ever seen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;The Viking-themed indie survival game&lt;/a&gt; has been shooting up the Steam charts, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;selling 3 million copies&lt;/a&gt; in an unheard-of 17 days. And people aren’t just buying it on a whim; they’re actively playing it, too. On Sunday, the game reached 500,000 simultaneous players, &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/"&gt;according to SteamDB&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the charred remains of four other all-time Steam player count records in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkKWvt"&gt;As of Friday, February 19th, the game had already passed &lt;em&gt;Postal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V &lt;/em&gt;to become the ninth most-played game on Steam at peak, but now it’s surpassed the records for &lt;em&gt;Among Us, Life is Strange 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; to reach the No. 5 slot, &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;according to Steam Charts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h6QcpW"&gt;It’s going to be an uphill battle from here: the four records it broke were in the 400,000 range, but the next record is the 830,000-player record &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;set at its December launch. To beat &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;, it’d have to cross 1.3 million players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmhIX"&gt;It seems completely doable, though, considering how rapidly the game has already grown, and the way it can suck you (and your friends) in again and again. There’s a huge randomly generated world to explore and loads to craft and build, with up to 10 people cooperatively working together. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;It’s fun&lt;/a&gt;, and with a remarkably shallow learning curve and a $20 price tag, I’d be surprised if it bottoms out anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB99Hj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; was built by a five-person team, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-dev-says-the-games-success-is-quite-incredible-and-very-humbling/"&gt;they tell &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; they’ll be hiring up now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops to buy right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptops at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ow4mCb"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 looks different from those of years past. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. That’s why the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D14gn"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new gaming laptop models hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers. Intel’s Tiger Lake H series is also on its way, though we expect to see those more frequently in lighter-weight models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. The upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will offer up to a 240Hz panel with QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4uNIZ"&gt;If you’re looking for some gaming laptop deals, keep an eye on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;deals coverage&lt;/a&gt;, where we highlight the best discounts you can get.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PEmMiz"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best gaming laptop 2021: Razer Blade Pro 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hw1GXC0JJNr36nQ6K4vzlWTH-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21820230/mchin_181119_4158_0015.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wsMJEI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MaGh3q"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cYdW6R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505968"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n9BvYP"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="wzRw2D"&gt;The best thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Strix Scar 15 is a colorful laptop with a premium price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E7sNUb"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The flashiest gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tCRMB0"&gt;The best gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Stealth 13 is a gaming laptop that’s a breeze to carry around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="YDSZZF"&gt;The best 13-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="8Da3D3"&gt;The Blade Stealth 13 is far from the most powerful gaming rig out there, but it is one of very few gaming systems that come in a 13-inch chassis. The Stealth can run AAA titles at native resolution and comes with a 120Hz screen, but it’s comparable in size and weight to a MacBook Pro. Use it in a meeting or a classroom, and passing observers may have no idea it’s a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xdg8S1"&gt;In addition to its powerful chips, the Stealth comes with a colorful keyboard, a sturdy build, and a decent webcam. Even the battery life is pretty good. If you’re looking for a laptop that’s small but mighty, the Stealth will get the job done as a gaming rig and productivity machine in one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7cRV6L"&gt;8. Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="5tIPDZ"&gt;The best gaming laptop for content creators &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="cXeYk1"&gt;One of the benefits of gaming laptops is, with their powerful graphics cards, they can double as drivers for content creators who want to get photo or video work done on the go. For these folks, the Aero 15 is as versatile as it comes. It has gaming laptop chips inside and a flashy RGB keyboard on the outside, but it pairs them with a gorgeous OLED display rather than a high refresh rate panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XclmXe"&gt;Those specs don’t come cheap, and plenty of people will be just fine with a more affordable gaming laptop or a standard OLED ultraportable. But if you need powerful specs, a color-accurate screen, and a portable chassis, the Aero 15 delivers all three. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rtol9z"&gt;Netflix is adding a new mobile feature that will automatically download show recommendations and movies based on viewer history. Downloads For You launches globally today for Android users, the company &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/downloads-for-you-takes-on-the-go-to-the-next-level"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyQefJ"&gt;You’ll need to opt in to use the feature. Once toggled on from the downloads tab, you’ll need to set how much space — 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB — you’ll want to use. More space equals more Netflix recommendations downloaded. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that although Netflix’s full catalog is available with the feature, some downloads will be limited because of licensing restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpNGXj"&gt;The platform continues to improve its offline watching options; Netflix launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215134/netflix-smart-downloads-ios-automatic-download-wi-fi-deletion"&gt;Smart Downloads&lt;/a&gt; on Android &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17552858/netflix-smart-downloads-episodes-shows-android"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically deletes downloaded episodes after they’ve been watched. Although Downloads For You is currently only available on Android, an iOS version will begin testing soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Irregulars imagines a sinister Sherlock who steals credit for supernatural sleuthing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LavfALOqGwtF7iwDud7qyaO_zI=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856563/TheIrregulars_Netflix.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sas8A"&gt;Netflix’s next Sherlock Holmes project, &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;, just got a new teaser highlighting the dark, supernatural adventures yet to come on the eight-part series. &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;, set to start streaming on March 26th, follows a group of “troubled street teens” who are “manipulated into solving crimes” by the “sinister Doctor Watson,” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrZIQ0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; is based in part on the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street urchins in Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes novels that helped Watson and the famous consulting detective gain a street-level view on London and handle some of the busy work of solving mysteries. Netflix’s version, created by Tom Bidwell, seems to take things in a far moodier and spookier direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpwVYk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1APF6a4m74k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IffUW"&gt;The Baker Street Irregulars have appeared in some Sherlock Holmes films and television shows over the years (recently reworked as a “Homeless Network” in BBC’s &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;choice to seemingly position Holmes and Watson as people taking advantage of these young kids seems ripe for some interesting stories. Bidwell summarized the idea in an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/3f5c208a-d2f4-4a14-9e55-a6a05c9c2ddc"&gt;interview with the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ko48zH"&gt;Sherlock Holmes had a group of street kids he’d use to help him gather clues so our series is what if Sherlock was a drug addict and a delinquent and the kids solve the whole case whilst he takes credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DqH7IL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; follows Netflix’s recent success with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455049/enola-holmes-review-millie-bobby-brown-henry-cavill-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, focused on the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes. The film prompted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate to sue Netflix&lt;/a&gt; for depicting Holmes’ personality as too emotional, an aspect of the character they claim wasn’t invented until later Doyle novels that aren’t in the public domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boiW0B"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193330/netflix-enola-holmes-doyle-estate-sherlock-holmes-emotions-lawsuit-dismissed"&gt;The lawsuit was dropped&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a funny coincidence that the aloof, elusive, icy Sherlock Holmes who likely wouldn’t care about the supernatural danger the Irregulars will face also happens to be the Holmes in the public domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMO747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;eight-episode series premieres on Netflix on March 26th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This leak shows that Sony’s noise-canceling earbuds could fit in your ears better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOIDpv4wMdQllAePOQNH7YFtaDM=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856308/1000XM4.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jFcLY"&gt;Sony’s upcoming WF-1000XM4 earbuds may have been shown off in a leak, with a slimmed-down design. &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/741/741151.htm"&gt;The leak from &lt;em&gt;MyDrivers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/sony-wf-1000xm4-design-leaked-wf-1000xm3-sucessor/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) claims to show the sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;Sony’s very good WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; — and if it’s real, it seems like a nice design upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj5iD7"&gt;The new purported design does away with the large, Popsicle-stick-like design that sticks out of the user’s ear, and instead goes with a more modern style of bud that fits in your ear — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s WF-1000XM3, for reference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="quR3nx"&gt;The leaked image shows a copper accent cylinder that acts as a design flair similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/walkman/nw-wm1a"&gt;its modern, high-end Walkmans&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll likely have to wait for an official announcement to find out its purpose — whether it’s a charging port, microphone array for active noise cancellation, or something else entirely. At the moment, though, I can’t help but hope that this leak is real, as these are a considerable improvement over the old model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Malaysian news site fined $124,000 for five reader comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MALAYSIA-MEDIA-COURT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_MtHIrbKpQ7wmmvqMyuP8tRgRQ=/4x0:4596x3061/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856120/1231247672.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSaXE6"&gt;A Malaysian news site was fined the equivalent of nearly $124,000 for five comments below an article. News outlet &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/malaysiakini/status/1362681271470551045"&gt;raised money&lt;/a&gt; to cover the fee of 500,000 ringgit, but human rights advocates say it was targeted for its reporting on government corruption, and they worry that the case could chill political speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hPpD5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/world/asia/malaysia-press-freedom-guilty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the verdict on Friday, when a panel of judges found &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; guilty of contempt of court. &lt;a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532693"&gt;The outlet argued&lt;/a&gt; that it wasn’t responsible for reader comments, and it removed them after police warned that the comments illegally insulted Malaysia’s judiciary. But the court said it should have preemptively moderated the comments and never allowed them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knFm1b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; is a prominent independent outlet, and it’s earned international accolades for its reporting over the past two decades. It’s faced &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54277437"&gt;periodic legal harassment&lt;/a&gt; within the country, though, culminating in the contempt of court charges that were filed last year. Co-founder Steven Gan also faced charges and a possible prison sentence. Gan’s situation was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/media/freedom-digital-news-sites-autocrats.html"&gt;compared to that&lt;/a&gt; of Filipino journalist Maria Ressa, whom authorities accused of “cyber libel” after her site &lt;em&gt;Rappler&lt;/em&gt; published critical reporting. But unlike Ressa, who was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/876943655/philippine-journalist-maria-ressa-found-guilty-of-violating-cyberlibel-law"&gt;convicted last year&lt;/a&gt;, Gan was acquitted of personal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAPEC6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that this case was the first of its type brought against a news outlet in Malaysia, and Amnesty International Malaysia called it “a grave setback for freedom of expression in the country.” But Malaysia’s internet crackdown echoes an international push to make sites legally responsible for what users post — including in the United States, where lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;have taken aim&lt;/a&gt; at a rule offering blanket protection against liability.&lt;/p&gt;
