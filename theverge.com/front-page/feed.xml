    <title>Amazon is ending Evangelion by bringing the final film to Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVY0eCjscsxzq5Q_3iDILBUCRhE=/0x820:1562x1861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531324/EVANGELION_3.0_1.01_THRICE_UPON_A_TIME.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjIibO"&gt;Amazon is bringing the conclusion to the Rebuild of Evangelion film series — adaptations of the beloved anime &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion &lt;/em&gt;created by Hideaki Anno&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZfuWMDEJpw"&gt;Prime Video on August 13th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.0 + 1.01 Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt; came out in Japan in March but will be making its global premiere on Prime Video in over 240 countries and territories, Amazon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9epA"&gt;Alongside the final fourth film, Amazon will also stream the other films in the series, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo&lt;/em&gt;. The company hasn’t said when those films will be available on its service, but hopefully in time to catch up for &lt;em&gt;Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;’s August release. You can watch a trailer for the new movie below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y2hNaO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZfuWMDEJpw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YINBPX"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; “Rebuilds” are an interesting mix of reworked moments from the original anime and entirely new plot lines and character backstories that only appear in the film series. If you caught up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114331/netflix-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; when it came to Netflix in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, there are lots of interesting departures and fully animated Eva battles to discover in the Rebuilds. Plus the show and films’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/22/18701441/neon-genesis-evangelion-hedgehogs-dilemma-shinji"&gt;darker psychological themes&lt;/a&gt; probably hit too close to home for anyone who’s had a mini-existential crisis during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HXPAJ"&gt;That Amazon managed to snag &lt;em&gt;Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt; and its predecessors seems like a pretty big knock against Netflix’s anime empire. Most streaming services are now trying to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21003549/anime-streaming-wars-netflix-amazon-att-sony-crunchyroll-funimation"&gt;some kind of anime strategy&lt;/a&gt;, either through the acquisition of other platforms or just by throwing money at popular creators. Netflix missing out on scooping up more &lt;em&gt;Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; to go with the series and original two feature films it already offers is a loss. More mechs for Bezos, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfPSMq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32hI4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nHVwN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter considers letting you limit tweets to ‘trusted friends’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmkzaQ77Q4XmuhSE85oVm5zqCKo=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531124/trustedfriends_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of what the new trusted friends feature could look like.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZaIbf"&gt;Twitter has shared three early design concepts for new features it’s considering for its service. “Trusted Friends” would let users limit the audience for select tweets to a smaller circle of close friends, while “Facets” could let you categorize your tweets when you send them. Finally, the service is also considering letting users list certain phrases that they’d rather not see in their replies. These ideas are in their early stages, Twitter says, and none are currently in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5jjlj"&gt;Many Twitter users already have multiple accounts to separate their work and personal lives, often with one of them being private to prevent sharing personal news too publicly. But features like Trusted Friends and Facets could allow for the same functionality from a single account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYnz22"&gt;Trusted Friends could offer a toggle to let you signify that a tweet should be public or only for friends (similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;Instagram’s “close friends” feature&lt;/a&gt;), while Facets offers more granular control, theoretically letting you sort your tweets into not just professional and personal categories, but also specific hobbies or interests you might have. Twitter says you might then be able to follow someone just for their tweets on a certain topic, rather than having to follow their account as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLg3OPYNXY7CNjOrVBQ2RCfTUOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693129/facets_2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facets could let you follow only select tweets from an account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qphXd7RKPCaLltlw-u1MkMuf7eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693128/facets_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users could then select the intended recipients of each tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PeEpyi"&gt;The final proposed feature would let you specify certain phrases you’d rather not see in the replies to your tweets. Followers would then see these phrases highlighted, alongside a warning to not use this language. In one of Twitter’s example screenshots, the word “asshole” is highlighted alongside a warning. Although Twitter says that people could ignore the guidance, tweet authors would have the option of moving these violating replies to the bottom of the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00j8rZ"&gt;Twitter cautions that it isn’t currently actively building any of these features. Instead, the hope is that tweeting about them early could help the company gather feedback about its plans while they’re still in their early phases. Last month Twitter privacy designer Dominic Camozzi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_dcrc_/status/1404578211309056006"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a similar work in progress feature to let users “unmention” themselves when they’re tagged into a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIc2LWhwkjGOGwVpxEqlwpnVN40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693130/smellcheck_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example warning about a banned phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EgRejo"&gt;It comes just weeks after the company started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;publicly testing a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt;, only for people to quickly discover that it risked showing whoever’s receiving the money the sender’s home address when using PayPal. Although the problem was technically caused by PayPal rather than Twitter, critics argued the social network should have given users more warning when they used the payment feature. Discussing features like these earlier in their design process could theoretically root out problems like these before release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y0bMv"&gt;Equally, Twitter’s features have a habit of becoming public before they’re officially announced because of the work of app researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;like Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, who dig through its app’s code for signs of unreleased functionality. If Twitter pre-announces a feature like this before it starts building it, there’s less of a chance of outsiders finding it early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RF4xbm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Perhaps the right prompt (in the right moment) can help everybody be their best selves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think? And what would you call this feature?  &lt;/p&gt;— A Designer (@a_dsgnr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/a_dsgnr/status/1410690521522130948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>What’s the deal with the Seinfeld soundtrack finally coming out?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="seinfeld" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hHc6IJAscYgh79BroFvgt9OGcs=/0x40:960x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531118/seinfeld.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi4K7q"&gt;The hottest album of 2021 is about to drop. The soundtrack of the hit ‘90s sitcom &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;will be released on Friday, July 2nd (via &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on “all digital platforms,” though specific platforms weren’t stated. I expect to hear the bouncy slap bass-driven theme song that never fails to make me laugh blaring out of cars, apartments, and cafes this Fourth of July weekend. Believe it or not, there will be 33 tracks on the album, and it’s apparently the first time that this music will be made available in an official fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgW96K"&gt;The composer, Jonathan Wolff, told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;that the soundtrack contains some music that was created for the show but never actually appeared in it. Three jazz songs were made for scenes where Elaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) goes to see a date playing in a jazz club in the seventh season. The scenes were eventually cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUee3C"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, there’s plenty of variety on the album:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YE7neV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The range of styles is surprisingly broad: hip-hop for “Kramer’s Pimpwalk,” happy whistling and guitars for “Jerry the Mailman,” a “Mission: Impossible” vibe for “Jerry vs. Newman Chase,” suspense-thriller scoring for “Cable Guy vs. Kramer Chase,” ’90s rock for “Kramer’s Boombox,” Eastern mysticism for “Peterman in Burmese Jungle,” and vintage guitar-and-harmonica blues for “Waiting for the Verdict” from the series finale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="u8K6cv"&gt;But let’s be honest. You, me, and everyone else are just going to absolutely &lt;em&gt;crank &lt;/em&gt;that theme song. Soon it’ll be easier than ever to play at a moment’s notice, but it’s interesting to hear that the now-signature bass groove (which was actually created on a keyboard) and the scat-like sound effects that are sprinkled throughout each episode almost didn’t make the cut. NBC executives said it was “weird, distracting and annoying,” according to the composer in &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety’s &lt;/em&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipx1PF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;co-creator Larry David had a predictably Larry David-like response: “Larry was deeply offended, and didn’t change anything,” the composer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GG9HMM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVldNNHQWVw?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=134&amp;amp;start=134" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Live Text feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Grz1iv2Q-EqgdejaZyXhstVLLIM=/311x0:2249x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531103/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_3.24.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDK9Nx"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;now available in public beta&lt;/a&gt;, which means that today you can try out all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;biggest features coming to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; this fall. That includes Live Text, the most technically impressive feature in the update, which allows you to pull text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more from pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8tcg"&gt;Live Text works with both handwritten and typed text, and supports English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Portuguese, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. It’s also important to remember that iOS 15 is still in beta, which means that Apple could tweak or change how Live Text works in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYxEg"&gt;Live Text works in a few different ways on iOS, depending on what you’re trying to use it for and where in the OS you are. Here are all the different ways you can use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYeuj4"&gt;With text fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_-4CyMdFNBnctjnp2raX6GOmuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694122/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “Text from Camera” option in the text select menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKoALRc81vn5sgQ2uh0tGV3l7Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694125/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Live Text works when importing text directly into a messaging field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwjojp"&gt;The most powerful — and useful — way to use Live Text is with virtually any text field on iOS. Whether you’re writing a text message to a friend, an email, or something in the notes app, you can add text that you copied from an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WegPR2"&gt;Once you’ve got the text you want (see below), tapping on the text field (as you would when accessing the pop-up select / copy / paste menu that’s been on iOS for years) brings up an additional option: text from camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXuh82"&gt;Tapping that new button will bring up a smaller camera window, which you can point at any block of text. iOS will then highlight the block of text it’s selecting, and you can drop it in just by hitting the “insert” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY7pXg"&gt;(You might want to proofread things, of course, before you send or post it — Live Text is pretty good, but its not perfect, especially when working with handwritten text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qX2cWjC_E_3p4yiYCYuyQqOCqV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694093/IMG_2826.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from the camera app’s live preview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6TmP4cBBPKSaemzq6soNwG4k3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694094/IMG_2825.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text in the Photos app, pulling handwritten text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Db9ALA"&gt;In the camera app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PVkw3d"&gt;If you have an iPhone XS or newer, you can also use Live Text directly in the camera app in real time. Just open the camera app and tap the live text button that appears in the corner of the viewfinder (it’ll pop up contextually when you’re pointing it at text) to grab text that you can then copy and paste. You can also interact with it directly in the case of phone numbers, email addresses, and links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2RbLOQ"&gt;In Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tRNnpQ"&gt;If you’re viewing any pictures with text in them in the Photos app, you can select and interact with text there. It works just like selecting actual text anywhere else on iOS: tap and hold on the text in an image and you’ll see the familiar-looking blue highlights pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-kF4ZNrLZ53OdaTJ_stZRdbRmE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694096/IMG_2827.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text’s “Show Text” option in Safari on iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-bVwPQgkk47K66Xw4fIh44mL0is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694100/IMG_2824.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from a screenshot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZiGX9k"&gt;In Safari&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Big tech companies will have to open Russian offices if they want to advertise in the country</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEa6YN"&gt;A new Russian law will require large social media companies to open offices in Russia if they don’t want to face advertising bans or &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-lawmakers-vote-force-us-tech-giants-open-local-offices-2021-06-17/"&gt;other penalties&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/putin-signs-law-forcing-foreign-it-firms-open-offices-russia-2021-07-01/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The law was reportedly signed by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and will apply to foreign companies that are “carrying out activities on the internet in Russia.” According to a Russian official, the law affects companies that have over 500,000 Russian visitors a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvmpjo"&gt;The Russian government has been looking to rein in Big Tech’s influence in the country. In 2019, it introduced a law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;required device makers to pre-install Russian-made apps&lt;/a&gt; on smartphones, TVs, and computers (with Apple being allowed to instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361762/iphone-russia-startup-local-apps-yandex-mail-ru-law"&gt;show the apps to users during the setup process&lt;/a&gt;). A host of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, are also facing charges in the country for allegedly not deleting illegal content from their services, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-hits-big-tech-with-new-charges-not-deleting-content-report-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOjfej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foreign companies having local offices gives governments more leverage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TVqncN"&gt;Foreign companies having local offices gives governments more leverage when it comes to enforcing their rules and regulations, when they may otherwise have fewer tools to do so. For example, in May &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;Twitter’s India offices were raided by the police&lt;/a&gt; after the social network applied a “manipulated media” label to a politician’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8urli"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it had no comment on the law, and Twitter didn’t immediately respond to request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse says Postal Service broke its own rules in new mail truck contest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQRfzHx3Y5LpQnL56utBjCZ9hOI=/0x22:2560x1729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530892/suburb2_9_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R5XNGX"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has accused the United States Postal Service of bias in choosing defense contractor Oshkosh to build the next-generation mail truck, and claims the agency committed “countless errors” during the selection process. Workhorse also alleges that the new mail truck that Oshkosh and the USPS debuted in February is entirely different from the one the defense contractor tested during the yearslong competition, and that it doesn’t have a working prototype, something the startup says is blatant evidence of unfair treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwT77I"&gt;These new allegations are at the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694043/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0__1_.pdf"&gt;heart of the complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Workhorse filed in the US Court of Federal Claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536793/workhorse-federal-bid-protest-usps-contract-oshkosh-ngdv"&gt;on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;, which was unsealed this week. (The court had allowed time for Workhorse, the government, and Oshkosh to agree on certain redactions before making the complaint public.) If Workhorse can prove to the court that the USPS didn’t follow its own rules in giving the award to Oshkosh, there’s a chance that the judge could overturn the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYXA1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Claims of bias and unfair treatment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SD28qK"&gt;While the court fight has only just begun, the outcome could have an impact on how quickly the USPS moves to electrify its fleet, something that President Biden has said is a priority for his administration. Oshkosh and the USPS have claimed that the new truck can be powered by either an internal combustion engine or an electric drivetrain, though neither has actually showed how. Oshkosh is supposed to make anywhere between 50,000 and 165,000 of them over the next 10 years, though Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said earlier this year that only 10 percent of the new fleet will be electric to start, and that shifting more of it to electric power would cost billions of dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdliJC"&gt;“While bid protests are a normal part of the government contracting process, we do not comment on such proceedings,” Oshkosh Defense said in a statement. The USPS said it does not comment on active litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mccd09"&gt;A new mail truck is something that is desperately needed, as most of the current vehicles (which were designed by defense contractor Grumman) have been on the road for decades and have blown past their expected retirement date. They lack modern safety features, air conditioning systems, and are costing the USPS hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;Some have even caught fire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2DeaNb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"},{"title":"Just 10 percent of the new Postal Service fleet will be electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300281/usps-new-mail-truck-ev-electric-workhorse-biden-dejoy"},{"title":"How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jloLJG"&gt;This is why, in 2015, the USPS kicked off a contest to develop a new mail truck, or “Next Generation Delivery Vehicle” (NGDV). But that competition has almost entirely played out in secret over the last half-decade. The nearly 60-page complaint that was made public this week, while written from Workhorse’s perspective, offers one of the most detailed looks at how the contest played out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11fN9v"&gt;The Ohio startup would have received a much-needed boost from the USPS contract, which could ultimately be worth up to $6 billion. Workhorse says in the complaint that it spent “over $6 million designing, prototyping and refining a proposed NGDV.” It also paid $7 million to &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2019/12/12/workhorse-hackney-mail-truck-bidding-team-breaks-up/"&gt;buy out manufacturing partner VT Hackney in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which decided to drop out of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ejJe"&gt;Workhorse built six prototypes of a delivery vehicle that it says was designed from the ground up, as opposed to Oshkosh’s original entrant, which was based on a Ford Transit. The startup says it completed the design in just one year and built these prototypes in “a mere eighteen weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kk6iar"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse says the vehicle USPS chose didn’t go through official testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AR1w"&gt;“[Our] prototypes successfully completed the USPS test requirements of 24,000-mile durability testing and the 120 simulated delivery routes without any safety-critical incidents,” the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpA63n"&gt;But when the prototype phase wrapped up, the startup argues that the USPS unfairly evaluated Workhorse’s prototypes and its ability to produce large quantities of the new mail truck. The USPS “failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal,” the company says, and ultimately the agency judged “Workhorse far more harshly and [held] it to far stricter standards” than Oshkosh or other competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WK7Fso"&gt;Specifically, Workhorse believes the USPS wrongly scored the startup on the various categories that the agency said it would evaluate in picking a winner — things like total cost of ownership, prototype performance, quality of the design and technical approach, and supplier capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnF277"&gt;Workhorse says that it told the USPS in its proposal that its electric vehicles, which have fewer moving parts, could “reduce long-term vehicle maintenance expenses by approximately 60 percent as compared to fossil-fueled trucks” despite similar up-front costs. This was something the USPS said it valued highly. In its solicitation for prototypes, the agency said it would pick the design that “offers the best value to the Postal Service,” with “value” defined as “weighing total cost of ownership, technical evaluation results, and risk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E90Jj7"&gt;Workhorse says the USPS whiffed on how it calculated total cost of ownership, as it still gave Oshkosh the top score. It also claims the USPS wrongfully blamed Workhorse for an incident during testing where one of its prototypes rolled away into a ditch. The test driver — supplied by the USPS — was at fault in that crash, Workhorse claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asORVV"&gt;While Workhorse has inked some small deals with big companies like UPS over the last few years, the company has struggled to make money, instead turning to loans from hedge funds and selling parts of its business to survive. The startup says the USPS “afforded undue weight to Workhorse’s prior experience” but doesn’t go into further detail in the complaint about how its history may have impacted the agency’s decision. Oshkosh, on the other hand, has a long history of bidding for and winning government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFXehj"&gt;Still, Workhorse argues, the USPS “put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWEZAi"&gt;“No rational analysis could conclude that the best value for the USPS’s fleet for the next twenty years is a vehicle that has yet to be built (much less prototyped), uses an internal combustion engine rather than an emissions-free electric motor, and that almost certainly will be more expensive to own and operate than Workhorse’s existing and tested vehicle,” the startup writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q6TZww"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The USPS authored a “lengthy screed aggressively attacking Workhorse” in March&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqOpNc"&gt;According to the complaint, Workhorse initially tried to plead its case with the USPS outside of federal court. It filed a “good faith disagreement” with the USPS in March in an attempt to make the agency withdraw its award based on these complaints. But the company claims it was completely ignored by the USPS during nearly the entire 10-day response period. And at the end of that 10-day stretch, the USPS denied the attempt with what Workhorse describes as a particularly nasty letter that raised issues with the startup’s proposal that the agency hadn’t previously mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7X6Oi"&gt;“[T]he USPS spent the resolution period authoring a lengthy screed aggressively attacking Workhorse and its years-long effort to assist the USPS in developing a first-rate NGDV,” Workhorse writes in the complaint. “The USPS delivered its scorched-earth ‘resolution’ decision to Workhorse on the evening of the tenth day, March 22, 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21q0oF"&gt;“Aside from its remarkably hostile tone, the USPS’s Response Letter is full of misleading statements, mischaracterizations, distortions, and strawman arguments. There can be little doubt that it was written for an audience other than Workhorse,” the startup writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNfDPc"&gt;In that letter, though, Workhorse says the USPS admitted that Oshkosh submitted two separate vehicle designs — one combustion engine and one electric — in the final phase of the contest that were different from the Ford-based van it had put through testing. It was the USPS that decided to combine these two proposals from Oshkosh, according to Workhorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irVm2Q"&gt;Another thing Workhorse takes issue with is that Oshkosh does not have a history of developing electric vehicles. In late 2020, Oshkosh itself even warned investors in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000775158/000156459020054491/osk-10k_20200930.htm"&gt;a filing with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; that it “may not have the expertise or resources” to compete as the market shifts to electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AHy3Qc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse says “The USPS is gambling” on Oshkosh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p713mC"&gt;This is not just an ideological argument; Workhorse lays out the case in its complaint that Oshkosh’s inexperience with developing zero-emissions vehicles could cause trouble, as the USPS says it wants the new fleet to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, which is supposed to make sure that the federal government “gives proper consideration to the environment prior to undertaking any major federal action that could significantly impact the environment.” There’s a chance, Workhorse argues, that the USPS may need to change the timeline or scope of the NGDV order — or terminate the contract entirely — if the fleet isn’t compliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFTXZd"&gt;“The USPS is gambling that not only will Oshkosh’s maiden foray into electric vehicle manufacturing be successful, but also that Oshkosh will succeed while at the same time producing hundreds of thousands of a gas-burning version,” Workhorse writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrYD6G"&gt;What’s more, Workhorse argues that Oshkosh improperly lobbied the House of Representatives, the White House, the USPS, and the Postal Regulatory Commission during the bidding process, as did Ford. Workhorse says this violated the NDA that the USPS made competitors sign as well as the ground rules for the contest. But Oshkosh wasn’t punished, while the USPS hammered Workhorse for making public statements about its prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EsU4PJ"&gt;“In contrast to its complete disinterest in the Oshkosh team’s NGDV lobbying campaign aimed at every entity involved in the award decision and funding of the procurement, in violation of the NDA and the Ground Rules, the USPS castigated Workhorse for making innocuous and good-faith public statements confirming its participation,” the startup writes. “The double standard on display here is as troubling as it is obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your Mac from the macOS Monterey beta to Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QsFRv8tXEAOtBo2Aq053anr3AdU=/102x0:1790x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530607/lcimg_71a6f738_86b9_4aed_a194_067e8224a6d4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFr15"&gt;If you downloaded and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22323032"&gt;installed the macOS Monterey public beta&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a chance that you may want to return to Big Sur, which is currently the stable macOS version. There are a couple of different ways to restore your Mac’s original software; which one you should follow depends on how you installed the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y2Oq8"&gt;The path to restoring is easiest if you made a Time Machine backup before updating the operating system, or if you installed the beta on a separate partition via Disk Utility. If you installed the beta on your main partition without a backup, you can still restore your system to the older OS, but you’ll need to start fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GY1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple launches public beta of macOS Monterey, bringing updates to FaceTime and Safari","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JshbJD"&gt;Whichever path you chose, we’ll walk you through how to find your way back to a more reliable OS. Pick the method that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OQPMd"&gt;Note: some of these steps may differ, depending on whether your Mac has an Intel processor or Apple silicon, like the M1 processor. If you’re not sure which you have, click on the Apple logo in your system’s upper left corner, and choose “About This Mac.” In the Overview, you’ll be able to see which processor you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2rnonW"&gt;Wait for the next stable update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jtcoqt"&gt;If you aren’t in a rush to go back your previous OS, you can simply unenroll your Mac from the beta program and wait for the next stable update, which will revert you to that OS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0lqDG7"&gt;Go to “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wstzaD"&gt;Select “Details...” in the bottom-left corner of the window, underneath the message “This Mac is enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RfLtFP"&gt;Select “Restore Defaults” to unenroll your Mac from the beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TPgSlk"&gt;Restore to a previous Time Machine backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxsIOR"&gt;If you made a Time Machine backup just before you installed the beta, then reverting to your previous stable OS is relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YnLOhK"&gt;Make sure you back up any files that you created while working with the beta (unless, of course, you don’t care whether you lose them). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loGbwO"&gt;Connect the external hard drive that you used for Time Machine backups to your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HL6r1r"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac and hold both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LrJR4a"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NP3ztg"&gt;Within the macOS Recovery window, select the drive, then find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In the Recovery window, find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BC-2dGFha7YDFLuk8mgpACs6cqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693975/macos_big_sur_recovery_reinstall_macos.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Recovery window, find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P1oWcS"&gt;Select the backup that you want to revert to. Note that the window will show the macOS version. Look for the last one that shows version 11 instead of 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KmCA0Q"&gt;Once the reversion process is finished, things should be as you left them before installing the beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i3RLDe"&gt;Erase a separate partition that contains the Monterey beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8H4pN6"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22323032"&gt;installed the Monterey beta to a separate partition&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to overwriting your main partition), you can simply eliminate that one to reclaim some SSD space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="K0Hlog"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac and hold both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aTowmg"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EKWrUQ"&gt;Once you see the macOS Recovery window, find the partition that you created and named. Then click “Disk Utility.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VLmv92"&gt;After the Disk Utility window opens, click the partition that you want to delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VqkWc4"&gt;You can ensure that it’s the correct partition (the one using macOS 12) by looking for the macOS version, which is listed under the partition’s name near the middle of the window. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; delete the partition for macOS 11, or else you’ll need to follow the steps in the next section to fully restore your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aldzr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; delete the partition for macOS 11, or you’ll need to fully restore your machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j077hY"&gt;When you’re ready to erase the partition, click “Erase” near the top-right section of the Disk Utility app, then click “Erase.” Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; click “Erase Volume Group” because that may delete your main partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IX6tFd"&gt;Erasing the partition won’t completely eliminate it. To do that, click the partition once again, and near the “Erase” button along the top-right corner, find “Volume” and click the minus symbol to fully remove it from your SSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N6SxtE"&gt;After that, you can click the Apple logo at the top-left of the screen and restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q0yuRr"&gt;Restore to a fresh install of macOS Big Sur&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zFe2Z8"&gt;If you don’t have a Time Machine backup, or you’d prefer to restore your Mac for a clean start, here’s how to proceed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="E6Nmp0"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac, holding both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uV8gdJ"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wkaoUn"&gt;Once you see the macOS Recovery window, click on your intended install drive, then click “Reinstall macOS.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1RwZQq"&gt;This process will restore your Mac to factory settings, so you’ll need to reinstall all of your apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MkV43L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AkotG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on an engineer who turned ‘free’ Xbox gift cards into millions in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htFKJbGg7AJnH0nue1ca-QGrLCs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530575/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAmh9M"&gt;When you can be in the right place at the right time, you can really make some things happen for yourself. Take, for instance, Volodymyr Kvashuk, who moved from Ukraine to the US for a career in computer science and wound up working as an engineer for Microsoft. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-microsoft-xbox-gift-card-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a new must-read feature from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that was exactly the right time to turn a loophole in Microsoft’s payment testing apparatus into a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin scheme — and a sick lake house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKeWmu"&gt;Kvashuk’s job was to look for flaws in how Microsoft processed payments by buying things like physical hardware using a company card and a fake login. Microsoft knew enough to not send him a Dell PC every time he ordered one, but Xbox gift cards bought online and sent to an email inbox weren’t accounted for, which was an opening Kvashuk couldn’t ignore. It was also just the thing he needed to earn a few quick millions. As Austin Carr writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VMyY4e"&gt;Kvashuk started small, generating Xbox cards in increments from $10 to $100. But his haul quickly escalated. By the time federal agents caught up with him almost two years later, he had stolen more than 152,000 Xbox gift cards, worth $10.1 million, and was living off the proceeds in a seven-figure lakefront home with plans to buy a ski chalet, yacht, and seaplane. This past November, a judge sentenced him to nine years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r5WSYv"&gt;All Kvashuk needed was a way to get a bunch of codes at once (his co-workers’ accounts would do), hide where the purchases were being made (rerouting those requests through foreign servers works), and resell the cards for cryptocurrency (a website called Paxful.com fit the bill) to get a delicious Xbox gift card crime soup going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Wqcz0"&gt;I’d be remiss to share more because Carr’s reporting on this story really is a fun ride. Kvashuk deploys some wonderful logic to justify his gift card operation — basically, gift card money isn’t real — which, in a way, reflects the way Microsoft and plenty of other companies have treated gift cards in the past. They obscured the actual value with point systems and hoped customers would treat the cards they bought like funny money. Kvashuk actually did — just in a way no one expected. You can read how Kvashuk did it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-microsoft-xbox-gift-card-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s IPO filing reveals Dogecoin helped its revenue skyrocket in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oGtv-QQ3hAyqeWQ2TGueZWtx3R8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530339/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtBmN3"&gt;The moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;that some of you have been waiting for&lt;/a&gt; is here — Robinhood’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm"&gt;S-1 filing to go public has been revealed&lt;/a&gt;, laying bare the kind of secrets you only learn when a company is legally obligated to reveal them. Only one day ago, the company agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;pay a record-breaking $70 million fine&lt;/a&gt; “for systemic supervisory failures and significant harm suffered by millions of customers,” and now its paperwork touts a commitment to “maintaining strong relationships with our loyal customer base and earning our customers’ trust when they choose our platform on their financial journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuwHNi"&gt;So what does the much-anticipated document include? There’s a note that the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California has executed a search warrant for co-founder and CEO Vladimir Tenev’s phone as well as information about a recent Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Division inquiry into Robinhood’s “For You” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCtSpo"&gt;According to Robinhood, some 1,600 jointly represented customers “may pursue arbitration of individual claims against us arising out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;the March 2020 Outages&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to other alleged system outages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cr86mt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“34 percent of our cryptocurrency transaction-based revenue was attributable to transactions in Dogecoin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEeLDj"&gt;GameStop is mentioned five times in the document (usually along with AMC and other popular Reddit stonks), mostly in describing Robinhood’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;decision to limit trading this spring&lt;/a&gt;. There have been about 50 class action lawsuits filed over the incident as well as investigations or inquiries from the USAO, DOJ, SEC, FINRA, and any other combination of letters you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioLHIV"&gt;Memes are inextricably a part of Robinhood’s business, as it notes that in the first three months of 2021, “34 percent of our cryptocurrency transaction-based revenue was attributable to transactions in Dogecoin.” At the same time, revenue from cryptocurrency transactions went from 4 percent for the last three months of 2020 to 12 percent of its total revenue in the first three months of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJ1pB"&gt;Robinhood (HOOD) says it has about 17.7 million monthly active users, about $80 billion in assets under management and despite the spike in activity, it lost nearly $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2021. Its S-1 filing also addressed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360639/robinhood-confetti-ipo-removed-app-stock-market"&gt;recent removal of a confetti celebration effect in the app&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “This practice drew scrutiny from certain regulators and the media and, in 2021, we introduced new unique visual experiences to mark milestones in our customers’ financial journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s camera-centric Xperia 1 III to ship on August 19th for $1,299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51YwlW54zMbn6cAuknjyqSuLwAk=/547x0:6454x3938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530326/Xperia_1_IIIcameraZeiss_frostedBlack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III puts an emphasis on advanced camera features and high-end display specs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Go4M5"&gt;Sony’s next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It’s available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony’s Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It’s also equipped with just about everything you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQSJmb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/24/21268097/sonys-xperia-1-ii-ships-july-24th-1199-us-united-states"&gt;Xperia 1 II launched at $1,200&lt;/a&gt; — pricey even for a top-of-the-line device — and Sony isn’t backing off by pricing this one at an extra $100. In this case at least, users in the US will be able to utilize its 5G connectivity; last year’s model had the right hardware but couldn’t use US 5G networks. The 6.5-inch 4K display has also been upgraded to a faster 120Hz refresh rate compared to last year’s model (which had a standard 60Hz rate), and you’ll get a bigger 4,500mAh battery, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6bena"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony Xperia 1 II review: it’s a stretch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDWEEb"&gt;If the Xperia 1 III sounds appealing but paying $1,300 does not, the Xperia 5 III is a smaller-screen variant that will likely cost a bit less, though US price and shipping are still unannounced. In the meantime, if you are willing to shell out top dollar for the 1 III, Sony’s offering a healthy preorder incentive by throwing in a pair of WF-1000XM3 noise-canceling earbuds for free on orders placed by September 26th. The Xperia 1 III will be sold &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/"&gt;directly from Sony&lt;/a&gt; and other third-party retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
