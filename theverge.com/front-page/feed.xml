    <title>Alphabet Workers Union demands YouTube ban Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bXalVL6aHmHfhYcEEzEy58FnABc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639338/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfpdLh"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) is calling on YouTube to permanently ban President Trump following a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th. The move shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212347/google-employees-contractors-announce-union-cwa-alphabet"&gt;the newly formed organization&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of employees and contractors at Google’s parent company, is dead set on influencing issues that go well beyond workers’ rights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez0dPR"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;YouTube removed a video of Trump addressing the attack&lt;/a&gt;, citing its policy against content that alleges widespread voter fraud. But the union called the response “lackluster” and said the company hasn’t gone far enough. “YouTube refuses to hold Donald Trump accountable to the platform’s own rules by choosing only to remove one video instead of removing him from the platform entirely,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1347331587315171330/photo/1"&gt;they wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The platform “will continue to function as a vector for the growth of the fascist movements if it persists in prioritizing advertisers while exposing the public,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FABOqg"&gt;Workers also called out YouTube’s role in allowing white nationalist movements to grow. “YouTube must no longer be a tool of fascist recruitment and oppression,” they said. “Anything less is to countenance deadly violence: from Gamergate to Charlottesville, from Christchurch to Washington D.C., from Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump. Alphabet, in failing to act, has done tremendous damage: to the thousands of victims of hate and to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WRdkO"&gt;Alex Hanna, a research scientist at Google and AWU member, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt; “It’s incredibly significant that our union has spoken out on YouTube’s complicity in perpetuating white supremacist content, misinformation, and hate speech on the platform ... As workers, we’re in a unique position to speak out against this behavior and push Alphabet towards being responsible for the social effects of its technology when it goes against its profit incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFfE3E"&gt;Other platforms have already taken concrete steps to stop Trump from continuing to spread falsehoods and incite violence. On January 7th, Facebook CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg announced in a blog post that Trump would be banned from both Facebook and Instagram indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;, for at least the next two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc48lN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter took a slightly weaker stance, locking Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;. The company said it would permanently suspend the president if he continued to violate its policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmfS3k"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htiuo9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8xpSl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaETNn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will change the face of PogChamp every 24 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ry0-W94a74Pwj9OGehmYFW_rSQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639227/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jDqsXV"&gt;Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;removed its popular PogChamp emote a couple of days ago&lt;/a&gt; after the person on which it was based — Ryan “Gootecks” Gutierrez — posted some tweets encouraging more mob violence after the riot at the Capitol. The spirit of PogChamp, however, will live on: today, Twitch announced that it would cycle through different versions of the emote every 24 hours, starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f0e6hg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You know what? In the spirit of figuring out 2021 together, let’s just roll with it for now! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get ready for a new PogChamp every 24 hours, starting today. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R16EyASsFx"&gt;https://t.co/R16EyASsFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347589555197595650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HAA12O"&gt;The reason PogChamp was popular was because it was the site’s global hype emote: when anything cool happened on Twitch, you could be sure to see people pogging in the chat. As the writer (and, full disclosure, my friend) Ryan Broderick put it in his excellent newsletter Garbage Day, &lt;a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-sun-is-going-down-and-youre-getting"&gt;Twitch removing the PogChamp emote was probably in service of taking the site truly mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPsIpa"&gt;“The other big part of this is that Twitch’s long-term goal as a company seems to be fully divorcing themselves from the reputation as an ESPN for gamers,” Broderick writes. “So the PogChamp debacle is basically perfect for Twitch — a small change that signals they’re no longer aligned with Gutierrez and everything within the specific toxic strain of the pro-gaming community he represents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbQYGd"&gt;Twitch’s push toward truly mainstream relevance didn’t start in 2020, and a year spent mostly inside helped move the site there. Perhaps the biggest win — and the strongest signal — that Twitch was beginning to achieve those goals was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) stream with some of Twitch’s biggest stars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;which was one of the largest individual streams the site has ever seen&lt;/a&gt;. The idea that there was a difference between Twitch influence and mainstream influence evaporated at the very moment AOC’s stream went dark. (Since then, internet-savvy congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/21/926329321/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-and-ilhan-omar-play-on-twitch-to-engage-young-voters"&gt;has also streamed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a cast of all-star broadcasters.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZpotw"&gt;I’ve reached out to Twitch for comment and will update this story when I hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIJZiD"&gt;PogChamp is dead. Long live PogChamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlD75Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwDJqF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf0ib5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bans r/donaldtrump forum for inciting violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington D.C. Tense After U.S. Capitol Is Stormed By Protestors On Wednesday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LM5FyYtYcSA7-WZLXNnA2nVkoE=/0x26:4798x3225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639176/1295288482.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Moore/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ULnd5"&gt;Reddit has banned r/donaldtrump for encouraging and glorifying violence after Wednesday’s mob attack on the US Capitol. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reporter Sara Fischer first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1347592263275311108"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the unofficial pro-Trump forum had been given multiple warnings. A Reddit splash page says the subreddit was “banned due to a violation of Reddit’s rules against inciting violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjKZuy"&gt;“Reddit’s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed,” a Reddit spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have also taken action to ban the community r/donaldtrump given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the US Capitol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IncYw"&gt;The r/donaldtrump forum had approximately 52,000 members before its ban, according to an &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106185207/https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/"&gt;Internet Archive snapshot&lt;/a&gt;. That was significantly smaller than r/The_Donald, a notorious Trump subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules"&gt;banned last year&lt;/a&gt; for pervasive rule-breaking — after many members had &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/months-before-reddit-purge-the-donald-users-created-a-new-home-a732f79e4f04"&gt;already moved&lt;/a&gt; to an independent site. However, &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/the_donald_reddit_discord/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that former r/The_Donald members had used r/donaldtrump as a conduit back into Reddit, promoting posts through backchannels like a Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08pVKR"&gt;This deletion marks the latest in an internet-wide crackdown on President Donald Trump and his most aggressive supporters, even as online researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219416/capitol-raid-identify-faces-online-footage-charges-law-enforcement-doxxing"&gt;used social media footage to identify mob members&lt;/a&gt;. Trump was suspended from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; after making inflammatory statements, although he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218794/trump-twitter-ban-lifted-unbanned-realdonaldtrump"&gt;been reinstated&lt;/a&gt; on the latter. Major web platforms have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;removed content&lt;/a&gt; that glorified the attack — which was aimed at overturning the US presidential election and left at least five people dead, including a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to HMD’s Nokia 6.2 leaks with side-mounted fingerprint sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afb8Zcj6DtxEHhoztues6VpTWFo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639112/d3288e72a4fef4453a86cd253218179b1b80e192eb9c16d05a402079e57cb971.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new phone has an extra rear camera compared to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64—1610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abYfuu"&gt;Renders of what’s believed to be the Nokia 6.3 or 6.4 have leaked online, giving us our best look yet at HMD Global’s upcoming affordable handset. The renders come to us via Steve Hemmerstoffer &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64--1610066614-289532428"&gt;over on Voice&lt;/a&gt;. New for this model is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, which replaces the rear-mounted sensor on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850871/nokia-6-2-7-2-phones-revamp-hmd-midrange-lineup-camera-features-specs-ifa-2019"&gt;2019’s Nokia 6.2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zENob4"&gt;Beyond this, there’s not a lot separating the Nokia 6.3 / 6.4 from the 6.2, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XW1G6NB?tag=gsmarena093-20&amp;amp;linkCode=osi&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently retails for $249 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still got a screen with a small teardrop-shaped notch, a headphone jack, and a circular camera array on its rear. However, Hemmerstoffer reports that the screen could be bigger at 6.45 inches rather than 6.3 inches, and it has four cameras on its rear, up from three last time. &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6_3_6_4_renders-news-47095.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the fourth sensor is likely to be for macro shots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxCQCU5dmtOGtEyiaMbs7ySeQBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222482/b0d4d9df850430313741c41b1bf3886db650a9f8912d944983c523399d12371b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64%E2%80%941610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise, it’s a very similar phone to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ldJ8S"&gt;There isn’t any indication of how much the phone is likely to cost as part of this latest leak, but &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was previously rumored to be priced at €249 (around $306). Hemmerstoffer notes that we should see an announcement before April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter suspends Sci-Hub account amid Indian court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Sci-Hub site, with its logo of a raven holding a red key, and a search bar for finding articles. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X8APx8PFPTXQ0DE-X91U-mIMj4=/0x0:972x648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638986/scihub_home_page.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sci-Hub’s homepage.  | Sci-Hub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFjp1I"&gt;Twitter has suspended the account of Sci-Hub, a website that provides free access to paywalled academic papers. The account was being used by Sci-Hub’s founder to collect statements of support from the scientific community during an ongoing court case in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="76nWlY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter suspends the account of Sci-Hub &lt;a href="https://t.co/XQfNYmR1Ra"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XQfNYmR1Ra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Catalin Cimpanu (@campuscodi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1347551800338112513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhIM5k"&gt;Journal articles are often costly to access, and many researchers and writers use services like Sci-Hub to bypass those costs. Publishers are unhappy about their content being distributed for free and argue that the site infringes on their copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0LzVH"&gt;In December, academic publishers Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society filed a suit with the Delhi High Court, asking Indian internet service providers to block Sci-Hub and similar site Libgen. The court rejected the publishers’ requests that the sites be blocked immediately, instead declaring it &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sci-hub-libgen-case-delhi-hc-to-hear-students-researchers/story-PxBftjgAPFPfuXGok4qG7N.html"&gt;an “issue of public importance”&lt;/a&gt; and allowing time for the scientific community to weigh in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1FzC"&gt;Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan had been using Twitter to gather and archive &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter.tweets.pdf"&gt;responses from Indian researchers&lt;/a&gt;, who argue that Sci-Hub is critical to their work. It’s unclear if the suspension is directly related to the court case, but “it happened right after Indian scientists revolted against Elsevier and other academic publishers after Sci-Hub posted on Twitter about the danger of being blocked,” Elbakyan &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-founder-criticises-sudden-twitter-ban-over-over-counterfeit-content-210108"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TorrentFreak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZXtzW"&gt;Publishers have tried to pursue legal action against Elbakyan several times before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit"&gt;but Sci-Hub has prevailed&lt;/a&gt;. As the “Pirate Bay of Science,” the site frequently switches domains to combat takedowns. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOrgX4"&gt;Madden now has a &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-21/seasons/nickelodeon?utm_campaign=mad21_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_m21nickannounce&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=67403&amp;amp;ts=1610125006572"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;-themed field&lt;/a&gt; so you can live out your dreams of playing football in a virtual Bikini Bottom. The SpongeBob Reef-Top, which will only be available in Madden’s arcade-style The Yard mode, will offer challenges that you can complete to unlock Nickelodeon-themed content as well as gear inspired by the famous yellow sponge himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIZIiU"&gt;In “the coming weeks,” you’ll also be able to unlock gear themed after Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward Tentacles. (TIL that Squidward’s canon last name is Tentacles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixI4Xl"&gt;Check out the field and some of the gear in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1347325823372681223"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from Madden’s Twitter account. I think the themed uniforms look really cool! I would love it if they were used in a real NFL game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google face pressure to deplatform Parler over calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This illustration picture shows the social media website from Parler displayed on a computer screen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XO_GO-OWfrvK8Qozat1kLO5T484=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638888/1225872887.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WDGyqC"&gt;Apple and Google are facing new pressure to deplatform Parler, a social network founded as a less moderated and more conservative-friendly alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Activist group Sleeping Giants has called on both companies to ban Parler from their app stores in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBxgR6"&gt;As evidence, the group posted screenshots of Parler posts calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad and encouraging “American Patriots” to return to the capital on January 19th “carrying Our weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NSgQ3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, we asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GooglePlay&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their own Terms of Service on Parler based on the sheer number of violent threats on the platform with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PullParler?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PullParler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the VERY CLEAR terms set by these two app stores below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4"&gt;https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347522919992336387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiVyHk"&gt;The group points out that both Google and Apple have clear rules against violent threats and moderation of content. Apple’s App Store says apps must have “a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted” and “a mechanism to report offensive content.” Google’s Play Store bars apps that “depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities,” and that “we don’t allow apps that contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmlvL"&gt;Neither Apple nor Google replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Parler also did not reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNiOPG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler saw its numbers skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; after Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation, with conservative protesters finding a home among like-minded users. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-john-matze.html?"&gt;Thursday interview with Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Parler CEO John Matze said any posts on the site indicating Wednesday’s riots were “illegally organized and against the law” would have been removed. “But I don’t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnbBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained particular momentum among Parler users, as well as other conspiracy theories around the election that had been debunked elsewhere. In the wake of the Capitol raid, researchers have circulated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;dozens of posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the attack on the Capitol. “Chloroform. Silencers. SHARP knives &amp;amp; keep walking,” reads one, “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” reads another, to which someone replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;On Thursday evening, the site had posts from Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1347570822437863424"&gt;questioning whether his concession speech&lt;/a&gt; was a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpzSI"&gt;There is some precedent for removing an app for hosting violent content. After a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned the social network Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic rants on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple had rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google removed the app from the Google Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayTgj"&gt;Since Apple and Google control the biggest smartphone operating systems, the companies wield immense power over mobile app distribution. The inability to push its app on the two biggest app stores greatly reduced Gab’s reach, forcing users to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;workarounds to use it&lt;/a&gt; on mobile sites. Gab’s desktop site, however, appears alive and well, with a new post from President Trump extolling the “great American Patriots who voted for me” leading the site’s “hot” posts on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmjee"&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook have implemented temporary bans on President Trump’s accounts, treating recent statements as likely to provoke violence. The platforms had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;adopted strict policies against election and voting misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2N9IJ"&gt;In a post on Parler Thursday, &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/23a2c1d63ea94c74b04d03917ad03339"&gt;Matze criticized Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for their actions against the president’s posts. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter believe the ends justify the means. They believe the American people are weak. They insult our founding fathers by suggesting Zuckerburg [sic] and Dorsey know what is best for us,” he wrote. “Parler is not an arbiter of truth. We believe in you. We believe you are wise enough to decide for yourself and trust that given access to all information we can self govern.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack is adding theming options to change the look of newsletters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack theming options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfC8i_K7IStiupGuCA3AAbZTZik=/108x0:1038x620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638876/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_5.16.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7oxsZ"&gt;Substack is adding a long-awaited new feature today: the ability to change the look of newsletters. Writers will now be able to choose their background color and accent color and set different fonts for the title and body of posts. It’s a limited set of customizations, but it should allow Substack newsletters to stand out more from one another — right now, they’re basically the same, save for profile pictures and the color of links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfogyf"&gt;The feature is being called Themes, and Substack says it plans to continually add more options for writers. It’s supposed to be available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Substack’s theme editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSsG3CwFRqsBFtVcP_8oBY12jJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220841/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.57.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ejPgAz"&gt;As fun as themes are, writers may get a lot more use out of two other features that Substack is planning for release sometime “soon.” Writers will be able to create sub-lists of members and only send out certain emails to them (Substack imagines lists of “founding members” or “lapsed readers”). It’s also adding a “multipub” tool that will allow writers to aggregate multiple newsletters and podcasts they manage under a single publication. &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; already has this tool and uses it to &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/"&gt;bundle a dozen titles&lt;/a&gt;, but soon it’ll be available to everyone. Substack expects the new options to launch in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFYpt"&gt;The features were announced this morning during &lt;a href="https://substack.com/on"&gt;Substack On&lt;/a&gt;, a one-day virtual conference for Substack writers. Substack was founded in 2017, and over the past year, has become an increasingly popular choice for journalists who want to run subscription publications. It’s managed to attract some high-profile names, including Anne Helen Petersen, Glenn Greenwald, and Matthew Yglesias.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s sudden accelerations were user error, US government says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlJvub_tLw_n7EfJ1ZjIePVOVig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638815/jbareham_180213_2301_0099.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1p5gd"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ended a year-long review of claims that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070324/tesla-sudden-unexpected-acceleration-nhtsa-petition"&gt;some Tesla vehicles were accelerating without warning&lt;/a&gt;, saying there is not enough evidence to open a full investigation. While NHTSA received 246 complaints about this “sudden unintended acceleration” phenomenon, the agency says that “pedal misapplication” was the cause of the problem in every case for which it had data to review — user error, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVE0aw"&gt;“There is no evidence of any fault in the accelerator pedal assemblies, motor control systems, or brake systems that has contributed to any of the cited incidents,” the agency wrote in &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INCLA-DP20001-6158.PDF"&gt;a summary published Friday&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no evidence of a design factor contributing to increased likelihood of pedal misapplication. The theory provided of a potential electronic cause of SUA in the subject vehicles is based upon inaccurate assumptions about system design and log data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oe1OJK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has been dogged by claims of sudden acceleration for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gjoQxy"&gt;Claims of so-called “sudden unintended acceleration” have dogged Tesla for years. The company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/tesla-resolves-most-of-lawsuit-that-alleges-sudden-acceleration"&gt;settled most of a purported class action lawsuit in 2018 over the issue&lt;/a&gt;. NHTSA says it collected crash data and video from cars’ “black box” event data recorders and from Tesla itself. While 246 cases were reported, the agency did not specify the amount of cases for which it collected data. The issue was thought to affect some 662,000 vehicles across Tesla’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFzyPk"&gt;The review was opened in January 2020 in response to a “defect petition” by Brian Sparks, &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INBC-DP20001-3494.pdf"&gt;an investor who was shorting Tesla’s stock&lt;/a&gt; (or betting that the price would go down). He corralled more than 100 complaints about the issue that had already been submitted to NHTSA, as well as similar events that had been covered in the press, and asked the agency to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrueF"&gt;“I believe Tesla vehicles have a structural flaw which puts their drivers and the public at risk. I further believe Tesla must know of this flaw and be unresponsive to it,” he &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INBC-DP20001-3494.pdf"&gt;wrote in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Sparks also took issue with Tesla’s reluctance to provide data about these acceleration events to owners. “This petition will show that, based on publicly available information, it appears Tesla vehicles have a Sudden Unintended Acceleration Problem and Tesla must know about this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgv0mH"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles"&gt;responded to the review with a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that claimed there was no merit to the idea. “We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle’s data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed,” the company wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRBQ0V"&gt;In a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday, Sparks said: “The rate of unintended acceleration reports remains particularly high in Tesla-made vehicles compared to other vehicles, however I trust the institutions of government. If NHTSA says there is no defect then I believe them. I thank NHTSA for evaluating the SUA allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1RppO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM unveils new logo to emphasize its pivot to electric vehicles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VjXHp3WIPEO8gKdg0G9p8VJT6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638682/GM_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEzB13"&gt;General Motors debuted a new logo meant to convey the automaker’s renewed commitment to the production and sale of electric vehicles. The company is also launching a new marketing campaign to underscore that commitment, as it seeks to compete with Tesla and other automakers that are rushing new EVs to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3lJqm"&gt;It’s been about a decade since GM has last tweaked its logo, but this update represents the starkest change in the company’s 113-year history. The most obvious change is the use of a lowercase “gm” in the logo, after previously only using capital letters. The underline has been shortened to just the “m,” in a nod to the company’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium electric vehicle battery and platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYdVXJ"&gt;The blue square has been rounded at the corners, giving the logo more of a smartphone app appearance. The blue is used as an outline rather than to fill the entire square, and the negative space in the “m” is meant to evoke the shape of an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfWrEv"&gt;“This is only the fifth logo change in 113 years,” said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of GM, in a briefing with reporters Friday. “And probably the most progressive thing that we’ve done since 1964.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PBg64y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is only the fifth logo change in 113 years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuEex2"&gt;A new marketing campaign will punctuate GM’s shift to electric vehicles. &lt;em&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt; author Malcolm Gladwell has been tapped as a spokesperson for the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqwRQzA37JAFuBDKkldCARJW3hY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222254/GM_Gladwell_Print_jpg.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WvvTyT"&gt;As an umbrella company for a family of auto brands, GM’s logo isn’t as recognizable as some of its rivals like Ford or Tesla. For example, the new logo won’t appear on any of its new EVs, from the Cadillac Lyriq to the GMC Hummer EV. As such, the new marketing campaign is intended to push the message of the company’s overall commitment to electrification rather than sell any one vehicle.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SojemT"&gt;GM has been loudly trumpeting its multibillion-dollar pivot to electrification for months now, while keeping an eye on the meteoric rise of Tesla’s stock price. On Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his own net worth surpass Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, making him the richest man in the world. And today, for the first time, Tesla’s stock value &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-tesla/teslas-market-value-zooms-past-that-of-gm-and-ford-combined-idUSKBN1Z72MU"&gt;eclipsed the combined values&lt;/a&gt; of GM and Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5n9tYz"&gt;GM has been trying to convince investors of its own commitment to electric vehicles. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic. GM has also said it will launch 30 new electric vehicles around the world, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdXOM6"&gt;GM unveiled two new EVs in 2020: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;the Cadillac Lyriq SUV&lt;/a&gt;, expected to go into production in late 2022, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, slated for late 2021. But the auto giant has been criticized for bringing vehicles to market too late, while other automakers are racing to get their EVs to customers much sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWwc3x"&gt;Up next will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401302/gm-chevy-bolt-tease-image-electric-ev"&gt;two new versions of the Chevy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, the automaker’s mass-market electric car that has been on sale since 2017. A refreshed Bolt and a larger Bolt Electric Utility Vehicle were first announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;the automaker’s “EV Day”&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and are expected to enter production in summer 2021. GM has also said it would release an electric Chevy pickup truck with 400 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCteX1"&gt;The new ad campaign, relying on Gladwell and a bevy of actors to proclaim the “inclusiveness” of electric cars, is a far cry from &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-11-26-fi-3165-story.html"&gt;GM’s first commercial for an electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. The ill-fated EV1 was the automaker’s first battery-powered vehicle, but was later killed off in a series of corporate decisions documented in the film &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489037/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Killed the Electric Car?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
