    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tykCLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzMpki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Apex Legends’ hackers interrupt games with messages about ‘Titanfall’ hacking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="‘Apex Legends’ - Skulltown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-KQcVCcR-XEFqgQYe9GR7eRElg=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540942/apex_screenshot_world_skulltown.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘Apex Legends’ | Respawn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Afq8Ds"&gt;Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; has proven to be a hit, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;over 100 million unique players&lt;/a&gt;, and counted over 300,000 people playing on Steam &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RKRigney/status/1389947124419375111"&gt;at one time in May&lt;/a&gt;. But an issue bubbling over from its earlier &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; games is now having an impact on &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, as reports across social media show players running into messages from people hacking the game with a “Save Titanfall” message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2YmS8"&gt;Respawn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411777384294977536"&gt;acknowledged the issues on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying “We are aware of and actively investigating issues impacting @PlayApex playlists that are preventing players from getting into matches.” In a follow-up tweet at 7 PM, the developer said these attacks don’t put the personal information of players at risk, and that the team is testing a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="spx52n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re testing a fix now and will update when we have more confidence. Additional updates may be required. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, we’ve determined that this attack—while disruptive—has not put players’ personal information or accounts at risk. More updates to come as we make progress.&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411822173132627977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3EjMA"&gt;The issue has been going on for hours, and when players are affected, they can’t queue for new games at the same time that &lt;em&gt;Apex &lt;/em&gt;is hosting a special event drawing players back to the original versions of its first two maps (including divisive areas like Skulltown, pictured above). As &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-hackers-fill-game-with-messages-complainin-1847228032"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report, the messages have been appearing for players on PC and PS4. I joined a game on PC and when the match was over, I was greeted with the following message pointing to a “Save Titanfall” website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5haWtbeOg2ySzfZmsSEJtnqo2yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699225/SAVETITANFALL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqoaaE"&gt;It appears that whoever is behind this attack is doing it because of similar issues that have affected the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;games going back years. A problem attributed to a single person kicked players out of&lt;em&gt; Titanfall 1&lt;/em&gt; sessions on PC and inundated them with racist messages, making the multiplayer-only title largely unplayable, in an issue &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/titanfall/titanfall-hackers"&gt;dating back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3SPxb"&gt;In recent months Respawn has tweeted that “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1379204515748929538"&gt;help is coming ASAP&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1395446711682838530"&gt;the team is investigating&lt;/a&gt;” problems like DDOS attacks on the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; series, but the issues continue. With hacking becoming a game-stopping problem for a franchise that EA is counting on to provide over $750 million in net bookings during its 2022 financial year, solutions can’t wait much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6L--dHuUbfXRldeiadfgIhLMUm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699226/apex_net_bookings_2021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BLikts"&gt;Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year — and we are forecasting continued growth...We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY22, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. — &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2021/Q4/Q4-FY21-Transcript.pdf"&gt;Andrew Wilson, EA CEO&lt;/a&gt; (PDF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="sox25J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Players affected by the hack are unable to queue for any other game mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The website accuses EA of "fraud" for selling Titanfall while it's "unplayable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Clip via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YungLucianOG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YungLucianOG&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://t.co/4MqZi2UBh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4MqZi2UBh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apex Legends News (@alphaINTEL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alphaINTEL/status/1411660433786904576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnkjZB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 4th, 7:38PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added 7PM update from Respawn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher finds certain network names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qweLoqpMkgRNJe-alrQ6FnoMCE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540789/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9xZla"&gt;A security researcher has found that certain Wi-Fi networks with the percent symbol (%) in their names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones and other iOS devices. Carl Schou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that if an iPhone comes within range of a network named %secretclub%power, the device won’t be able to use Wi-Fi or any related features, and even after resetting network settings, the bug may continue to render Wi-Fi on the device unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VB7vyX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can permanently disable any iOS device's WiFI by hosting a public WiFi named %secretclub%power&lt;br&gt;Resetting network settings is not guaranteed to restore functionality.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#infosec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0day?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#0day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Schou (@vm_call) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiJve1"&gt;A few weeks ago, Schou and his not-for-profit group, &lt;a href="https://secret.club/"&gt;Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, which reverse-engineers software for research purposes,&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt; found that if an iPhone connected&lt;/a&gt; to a network with the SSiD name %p%s%s%s%s%n it would cause a bug in iOS’ networking stack that would disable its Wi-Fi, and system networking features like AirDrop would become unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NikSyL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; offered&lt;/a&gt; a possible explanation for the weird bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QmbFJV"&gt;the ‘%[character]’ syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the ‘%n’ specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="az5wDQ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it’s working on a fix, and will update if we hear back from them. But as&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the bug can likely be avoided by not connecting to Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their names. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Trump advisor’s Gettr platform appeared to be briefly hacked Sunday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-NJ98MlkjsLG70g1s-sBF4tCvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540385/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kHgHNW"&gt;Several verified profile pages on Gettr, the new social media platform from Jason Miller, once an advisor to former President Trump, were apparently hacked and defaced briefly on Sunday (via &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gettr-trump-allies-get-accounts-hacked-july-4-launch-day-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ClrE7"&gt;The accounts of several well-known Republicans, including Miller, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had their pages’ header images replaced with the same message: “@JubaBaghdad was here :) ^^ free palestine ^^.” according to screenshots. Twitter user @JubaBaghdad told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; it was easy to hack the pages and that he had done it “just for fun.” Most of the affected profiles appeared to be back to normal at the time of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W24jZT"&gt;Zachary Petrizzo, a writer for &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt;, posted screenshots on Twitter of what the pages looked like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oa4XYJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jason Miller's new right-wing social media site "Gettr" was hacked this morning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cncddw9RZ9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cncddw9RZ9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1411697118079860741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XlEqr"&gt;Miller said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the problem was detected and “sealed in a matter of minutes, and all the intruder was able to accomplish was to change a few user names.” He added that Gettr had already had “more than half a million users” sign up for the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZIUD"&gt;Gettr was supposed to have its official launch today, July 4th. It had a soft launch in June, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, and plans to host three-minute videos, 777-character posts, and live streaming video. Its app is live in Google and Apple’s app stores, with the tagline “Marketplace of Ideas.” The app’s “about” section describes it as “a brand new social media platform founded on the principles of free speech, independent thought, and rejecting political censorship and ‘cancel culture.’” The app has an M for “mature” rating, meaning it’s intended for users 17 and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGuzuX"&gt;After Trump was banned from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January following the insurrection at the Capitol building, he said he planned to launch his own social platform. A blog titled “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” launched in May on his website, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform"&gt;shut down and archived in June&lt;/a&gt;. Miller said at the time that the website was not intended to be Trump’s social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JNcSs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-trump-adviser-jason-miller-new-social-app-gettr-backed-by-guo-wengui-tied-foundation-11625199130"&gt;Miller told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that Trump wasn’t on Gettr at that point. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/former-trump-aide-starts-social-media-platform-without-old-boss?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the former president did not have plans to join Gettr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHsuOD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 4th 2:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Gettr CEO Miller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trese mashes a police procedural with a sinister supernatural world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fu63ZPt5Wos6BPacJL3OPnU2MJQ=/33x0:1155x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540341/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_1.34.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKeCle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nATKX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526762/netflix-trese-philippine-folklore-anime-horror-comic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most interesting new shows on Netflix, a gritty detective story set in a modern-day Manilla beset by all kinds of supernatural forces. It’s great, but it also ends quickly: the debut season is only six episodes long. Luckily, if you’re looking for more of Alexandra Trese, there’s plenty to dig into with the books on which the show is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="500PJR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; follows the titular Alexandra Trese, a Manilla resident who owns a club called Diabolical, but more interestingly, is also a consulting detective of sorts. Basically, whenever police officer Captain Guerrero comes across a crime he can’t explain, he calls Trese for her expertise on the city’s dark supernatural underworld. She’s the link between the human world and the magical, helping to keep the balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jult9I"&gt;The series is a mashup of genres. It’s structured like a police procedural, with each chapter covering a different crime. That could be terrifying — and hungry — &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiyanak"&gt;baby creatures&lt;/a&gt; that are terrorizing a mall parking lot, or a dead body that was found with a mysterious jar of ground-up mermaid bones. These supernatural elements lend the story a strong horror vibe, which is accentuated by the grisly, black-and-white art. The places Trese ventures are not places you’d want to go. It’s not just scary, though, as many of the stories are tinged with sadness, like a fading actress who will do anything to stay in the spotlight, or a raging fire monster trying to bring back a lost love. There’s drag racing, zombies, and a monster informant that just &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qeJ31tSt4bbkdBiclextkCtaTJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22696357/TRESE_VOL1_REVIEW_pg_8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4G7hF"&gt;For fans of folklore creatures, &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; is also a great chance to dig into the rich world of monsters from the Philippines. Not only are they the focal point of the stories, but each issue ends with handwritten notes from Trese’s father, which detail the specifics of various creatures, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiyanak"&gt;the vampire-esque tiyanak&lt;/a&gt; or god-like creatures that can control fire, lightning, or wind. Trese both works with and fights against these creatures; at almost all times she’s accompanied by a pair of violence-loving twins who wear creepy masks, one smiling and the other frowning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Low33f"&gt;If you’re into stories like &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Trese &lt;/em&gt;should be right up your alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; was created by writer Budjette Tan and artist Kajo Baldisimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ln88IX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re into the concept (or enjoyed the show), the good news is that there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; books to explore. The series is available digitally through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2FTrese%2Fcomics-series%2F149388&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22560965%2Ftrese-review-supernatural-detective-comic-netflix" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Comixology&lt;/a&gt;; the first volume is out now, with the second due on July 21st and the third on September 29th. In print, the first two volumes are available now, &lt;a href="https://ablazepublishing.com/trese_category.html"&gt;published by Ablaze&lt;/a&gt;, while the third is due out in September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok parent ByteDance has begun selling the video app’s AI to other clients</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LNcFGbfxZG2XCG12cPz4Drj6Ajg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540140/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok’s parent company has started selling its AI to other companies | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rVVusm"&gt;ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company of video sharing app TikTok has started selling TikTok’s AI to other companies, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bed7cba1-db7a-49c7-9d57-06fd19e14e10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (may require subscription). The company has a new division called &lt;a href="https://www.byteplus.com/"&gt;BytePlus&lt;/a&gt;, and according to its website, its client list already includes US fashion app Goat, Singapore travel site WeGo, Indonesian shopping app Chilibeli, and India-based social gaming platform GamesApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hfsir"&gt;TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is a huge part of what has made it so popular. Essentially, the way you interact with the app affects what videos it will recommend to you. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; last year how its ForYou feed determines what videos to serve a given user. Its recommendations are based on user interactions including which videos you like, share comment on, or create; video information, such as captions and hashtags; and device and account settings including what device you’re using, your language preferences, and your location settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvKmZ3"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, BytePlus offers customers the chance to access the recommendation algorithm, and personalize it for their apps and customers. BytePlus also offers automated speech and text translation and real-time video effects as well as data analysis tools, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJgyyl"&gt;Over the past year and a half ByteDance and TikTok were among the China-based companies targeted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of executive orders from former President Trump, that sought to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;block China-based apps&lt;/a&gt; from US app stores. President Biden signed an executive order in June revoking the bans. Despite the pressure from the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"&gt;TikTok surpassed 100 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in the US last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7GMtI"&gt;ByteDance didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWgq4o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL 20 Pro 5G review: good looks aren’t everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes premium features you’d be hard-pressed to find in another $500 phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSGHyq"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is a good-looking budget phone that works out some of the first-gen kinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;we encountered in the 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t quite ready to take on the category heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMAQQq"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price, but this time you get more storage and 5G, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6klsf"&gt;It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels, and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy, and kind of retro cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eWAn76"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10634905"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nudokf"&gt;Good looks aside, I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly, the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINwzQ"&gt;It also lacks compatibility with AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxRtx"&gt;There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G, and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device, but it still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ma3dxXAld7tygbzrq0GE5sXHAZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693979/ajohnson_210630_4655_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than offering a faster refresh rate, TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEU2ls"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CDOuhY"&gt;A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate, bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays, so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool, particularly after leaving the camera app, but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully, it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leyDBH"&gt;TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here, which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content, with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles, with “vivid” as the default, or turn it off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjQ7ch"&gt;We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed, and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off, it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said, I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone, it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xa93z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQ5WZ"&gt;The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates, and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real, but the effect is hard to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlygzZ"&gt;TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks, and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here, and there are a ton of functions you can map it to, from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode, like night or portrait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zoKYr"&gt;It’s really useful, but unfortunately, it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll, which nobody needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMLv2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HAibz"&gt;Moving along to the top edge of the device, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price, and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVzUo"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use, but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user, you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class, and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1910Q"&gt;On the software side, the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid, none) is common in this class, so that’s great to see. However, it will get just two years of security updates, which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies, respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6614"&gt;Otherwise, TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy, with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen, and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot, but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pc-uvEmcDX2EsQ0JR-ebB7ndNm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693982/ajohnson_210630_4655_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device, including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CF7tGL"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oDC2iD"&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization, which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40vSfH"&gt;The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on, but it’s not too distracting. However, there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out, and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump, which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D94MRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66E3QV"&gt;Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background, though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode, but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA8fP"&gt;All in all, the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwa5VdasTJagR-lQ2UjV1gCvLJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693981/ajohnson_210630_4655_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it offers some premium features for its price, the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YaZVgv"&gt;There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone, it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBQNV5"&gt;There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches, and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally, the camera is basic, and Nxtvision is underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdEFyR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3c8nC"&gt;And then there’s network compatibility — in the US, it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised, it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CwH3IS"&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel, then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option, with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a fast refresh rate screen, better network compatibility, and a solid four-year security support policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;The Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a good option, too, with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives, but depending on your priorities, they may serve you better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China regulator orders Didi ride-hailing app removed from stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Didi logo shown on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWKqRKv65FHUdGSMSTcAHEyDRKw=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69539986/533645962.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Didi has some 377 million users in China | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qA76cp"&gt;The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing’s app, claiming the ride-hailing company had been illegally collecting users’ personal data (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-agency-says-didi-illegally-collects-user-data-2021-07-04/?t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The regulator said it had ordered the company to make updates to put it in compliance with China’s data protection rules, but didn’t elaborate on what the violations may have involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="706ZXx"&gt;Didi was founded in China in 2012, and a recent regulatory filing shows it has &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-001221/#dk10201_dilution"&gt;377 million active users&lt;/a&gt; in China alone. The company just &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/didi-china-us-ipo-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;went public on June 30th&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest IPO of a Chinese company on a US stock exchanges since Alibaba in 2014. On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/business/didi-china-inquiry.html"&gt;CAC announced&lt;/a&gt; new user registrations for Didi’s service were being suspended pending a “cybersecurity review.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE06cM"&gt;In response to a request for comment, a Didi spokesperson pointed to a Sunday post on its &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4655333928344291?wm=3333_2001&amp;amp;from=10B5393010&amp;amp;sourcetype=weixin"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; (translated from Chinese via Google Translate) that said its app would be removed in accordance with the order, and that users who have downloaded the Didi app could continued to use it normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZa6lA"&gt;Over the past several weeks, China’s regulators have been cracking down on tech companies for a range of violations, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, with a focus on anti-competitive practices, inconsistent pricing, and the ways apps handle users’ data. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Games Done Quick’s speedrunning summer marathon kicks off Sunday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdIkD1aC__J8ifpD3FDNEFSVBiQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69539912/i_s6hBWf5_X5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SGDQ is You.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Games Done Quick&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkV5Kp"&gt;Games Done Quick’s weeklong summer speedrunning event for charity begins on Sunday, and looks to have a whole bunch of good runs to look forward to. Things kick off for Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) Online 2021 at 12PM ET on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;Games Done Quick Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPJUu"&gt;You can see the &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s packed with a treasure trove of interesting-looking runs. There’s a lot I want to check out, but I think I’m most interested in the &lt;em&gt;blindfolded &lt;/em&gt;70-star run of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZXjrT"&gt;SGDQ and its wintertime counterpart, Awesome Games Done Quick, are two of my favorite weeks of the year. I love watching players absolutely dismantle some of my favorite games, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRFVZHBj5Pc"&gt;this run of &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or pulling off superhuman stunts, like beating the hardest levels of the already-hard platformer &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_3f3q1bybQ"&gt;using a dance pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p5nf9x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_3f3q1bybQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqxSI"&gt;But since the marathon runs every hour of every day until it’s over, I also love checking the stream at random times of the day and just watching what’s on. Often, I’ll be introduced to a game that I’ve never heard of before, and it’s fun to learn all about it from people who are masters of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAi3yy"&gt;As the name of the event implies, SGDQ Online 2021 will take place entirely online (which was also the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21366548/summer-games-done-quick-2020-gdq-online-virtual-speedrun-marathon-charity"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;). Donations will benefit Doctors Without Borders, and in 2020, SGDQ raised more than $2.3 million for the charity.&lt;/p&gt;
