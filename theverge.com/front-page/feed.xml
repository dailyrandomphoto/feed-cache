    <title>Waabi, the rare autonomous vehicle startup with a woman CEO, raises $83.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pbUwV7lXsEst19_IfaLC5R8eYpk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421107/Raquel_Urtasun_Portrait_horizontal_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxJwSW"&gt;Waabi is a new autonomous vehicle startup with a few things going for it to help it rise above the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9YRdl"&gt;For one, it’s founded by Raquel Urtasun, a renowned expert in computer vision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15578606/uber-ai-labs-self-driving-car-research-toronto"&gt;who ran Uber Advanced Technology Group’s Toronto outpost&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the few women-led AV startups in the world. Second, the Toronto-based company just came out of stealth having raised $83.5 million, which is among the largest Series A rounds ever raised in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTUYpw"&gt;The round was led by Khosla Ventures, with additional participation from Urtasun’s former employer, Uber, and Aurora, the AV startup that ended up acquiring Uber ATG in a deal last year. Funding was also raised from 8VC, Radical Ventures, Omers Ventures, BDC, AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel, Sanja Fidler, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHh6JG"&gt;That’s a pretty auspicious start for a company that’s jumping into a very crowded space with dozens of startups trying to solve what is arguably the world’s hardest problem: how to make cars and trucks drive themselves safely, reliably, and efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xamU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waabi’s approach will be to focus on trucking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6IqdH"&gt;Waabi’s approach will be to focus on trucking, using its proprietary software to automate driving on commercial delivery routes. And with its innovative approach to simulation and machine learning, Waabi says it’s poised to commercialize its technology faster and cheaper than most of the AV startups working today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG43Hh"&gt;Urtasun says her expertise in artificial intelligence, which she has been working on for over 20 years, also gives Waabi a distinct advantage. “I’ve seen really what works, what doesn’t work for AI and technology deployed in a commercial software stack,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VoD1w"&gt;There are two reasons Waabi is setting its sights on trucks as opposed to robotaxis or last-mile delivery vehicles. One is the “incredible” shortage of truck drivers, which Urtasun said could be rectified by the rapid deployment of fully autonomous big-rigs. The second is that highways are “simpler” than complex city streets for autonomous vehicles to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHg0Fz"&gt;There are fears in the trucking industry that autonomous technology will lead to enormous displacement among truck drivers. &lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/managing-transition-driverless-road-freight-transport"&gt;A 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; found that automated trucks could reduce the demand for drivers by as much as 50 to 70 percent in the US and Europe by 2030, with 4.4 million of the 6.4 million professional drivers on both continents rendered obsolete. These fears are heightened as tech companies introduce eye-catching, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923232/einride-tpod-self-driving-truck-sweden-logan"&gt;cabin-less prototypes&lt;/a&gt; designed to cut the driver completely out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXpVaA"&gt;Nonetheless, there’s been a mini-boom in the number of startups racing to be the first to deploy autonomous tractor-trailers. This includes well-financed companies like Waymo, TuSimple, and Aurora; OEMs like Volvo and Daimler; and a host of smaller startups like Ike (which was recently acquired by Nuro), Embark, and Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT459H"&gt;Waabi’s approach will be more “AI centric” than its competitors, Urtasun says. That means a sophisticated “closed loop” simulation program that reduces the need to accrue millions of miles of testing on public roads and highways. Waabi plans on buying several trucks to test its software, but Urtasun said it won’t need more than a handful of vehicles, thanks to its innovative approach to simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2n4JRw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can train an entire system to learn in simulation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u6WsNB"&gt;“So for us in simulation, we can test the entire system,” Urtasun said. “We can train an entire system to learn in simulation, and we can produce the simulations with an incredible level of fidelity, such that we can really correlate what happens in simulation with what is happening in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfTUxk"&gt;Urtasun and her team are also developing a new algorithm that will serve as the foundation for the “brain” of the self-driving car, which helps with motion planning and predicting what other vehicles on the road will do so the AV can react accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZ4il9"&gt;“You end up with a much better scaling technology,” she added, “that you can develop much faster and much cheaper than any of the solutions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2lm8o"&gt;Urtasun started working at Uber in 2017, when the ride-hailing giant brought her on to serve as chief scientist and head of research and development in Toronto. Over the years, her team grew from a small group of eight graduate students to eventually around 50 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYtqVY"&gt;In Toronto, Urtasun was largely insulated from the chaos that was quickly enveloping Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco. The company’s CEO and co-founder, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15844836/uber-ceo-resigns-travis-kalanick"&gt;Travis Kalanick, was ousted a little more than a month&lt;/a&gt; after Urtasun’s appointment was announced. And a year later, a self-driving Uber vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPk8im"&gt;An investigation into the crash faulted Uber for its lack of a robust culture of safety at its autonomous vehicle division. And late last year, Uber finally called it quits, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;off-loading its beleaguered Advanced Technology Group to Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to reduce costs and signal to investors that it had a real path to profitability. Aurora sent offer letters to about 75 percent of Uber ATG employees, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-station-zooxs-six-year-ride-aurora-makes-its-uber-atg-employee-picks-and-nhtsa-takes-a-new-position-on-avs/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but that did not include Urtasun’s team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0MR0j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is also one of the reasons why we were doing a lot of our development in simulation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zRkaFe"&gt;There was surprise among AV sources that Aurora didn’t extend an offer to Urtasun. Today’s news helps explain why. Urtasun said her experience at Uber, including the fatal crash in Tempe, “really imprinted the importance of safety and having safety first” at Waabi. “This is also one of the reasons why we were doing a lot of our development in simulation,” she added, “to reduce also the risk of developing this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDWOSD"&gt;“Raquel is truly one-of-a-kind — a tenacious and inspiring leader who empowers those around her to excel,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a statement. “I can’t wait to see everything she accomplishes for the self-driving industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG48xS"&gt;In addition to her work at Uber, Urtasun is also a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nO4wdc"&gt;Urtasun said she chose the name “Waabi” because it had a couple of relevant meanings. Among Canada’s First Nations tribes, it means “she has vision,” while in Japanese, it translates as “simple.” The first speaks to Urtasun’s expertise in computer vision and artificial intelligence, while the latter to her company’s intent to simplify the technology that powers self-driving vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEIm3i"&gt;It is rare for an autonomous vehicle startup to have a woman founder and CEO, but Urtasun says she hopes to inspire other women to join the industry. “This is a field that is very dominated by white dudes,” she said. “The way to build integrating knowledge is to build technology with diverse perspectives, because by challenging each other, we build better things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9z6nx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite season 7 has Superman, flying saucers, and a virtual influencer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hYzynnfVx31yMDnFOY4BbRYizgE=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420981/fortniteseason7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GfuEdm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465577/fortnite-epic-games-ufos-aliens-abducted-teaser-season-7"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, aliens have invaded &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s battle royale island. The game’s latest season — Chapter 2: Season 7 — is called “Invasion,” and it’s just kicked off with a sci-fi vibe that’s a big change from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;last season’s prehistoric theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gkYPD"&gt;Among the changes are flying saucers that players can hack and then pilot, weapons like a rail gun that can shoot through structures and a scanning device, along with a crafting material called nuts and bolts that lets players make classic weapons that were previously removed from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvqobW"&gt;As always, the big draw of the new season is the battle pass, which introduces a number of characters to the game for those who purchase it. For season 7 that means Superman (who will be available to unlock later in the season), a customizable alien named Kymera, a human / alien double agent called Joey, and a hulking battle droid. Perhaps the strangest addition is Guggimon, a virtual influencer with more than 1 million followers on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/guggimon/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOPIhn"&gt;For those playing on PC, the new season will also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465735/fortnite-pc-graphics-season-7"&gt;a number of visual improvements putting the game on par with next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy-focused Private Relay feature isn’t coming to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCCcszVbQIMAVAczbYw8rwNtDus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420969/acastro_180227_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyoW5M"&gt;Apple’s new Private Relay feature, which is designed to obscure users’ browsing data and protect their privacy, won’t be available in China, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was announced during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference as part of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;subscription bundle called iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Other countries where Private Relay won’t be available include: Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2Cbi9"&gt;The move is the latest concession Apple has made in order to offer its services in China, a market which &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes accounts for almost 15 percent of its revenue. Chinese citizens’ access to the internet is heavily regulated, and there is restricted access to technologies like virtual private networks, or VPNs, which help citizens evade tracking and bypass censorship. It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t itself calling Private Relay a VPN, citing technicalities in how it operates, but the service protects users’ privacy in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VNHGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is one of ten countries not getting the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcNs4M"&gt;In 2018, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17052802/apple-icloud-encryption-keys-storage-china"&gt;storing some iCloud encryption keys in China&lt;/a&gt; and transferred its Chinese iCloud operations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17055088/apple-chinese-icloud-accounts-government-privacy-speed"&gt;to a firm located in China&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple said the move would improve the “&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/apple-will-begin-storing-chinese-customer-icloud-data-at-new-china-data-center-from-next-month/"&gt;speed and reliability of iCloud,&lt;/a&gt;” critics said it would also let Chinese authorities access user data through the country’s legal system. The previous year, Apple removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16062172/apple-chinese-app-store-vpn-censorship-crackdown"&gt;several major VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store in China in response to local regulations requiring VPN providers to have a government license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IRER6"&gt;According to Apple, Private Relay encrypts a user’s traffic and sends it through two internet relays in such a way that no entity can see the contents of a user’s browsing data. A first Apple-controlled relay assigns a user an anonymous IP address, while a second third-party relay decrypts the web address and forwards the data on to its destination. Apple says Private Relay hides a user’s traffic from ISPs, advertisers, and even Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music begins rolling out lossless streaming and Dolby Atmos spatial audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRdBKE_7nCNHnJ1PAEJyreFdM7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420391/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDhcKy"&gt;Apple Music has flipped the switch on its previously announced lossless-quality streaming and spatial audio features. Starting now, if you’ve got the latest iOS, iPadOS, and macOS updates installed, you’ll be able to stream select tracks both in standard lossless/CD-quality audio and high-resolution lossless (if you have an external DAC for the latter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXBLTY"&gt;Apple said both features would arrive “today” during the WWDC keynote, but it took many hours after the event concluded before customers started seeing them appear in the app. You still might not if the rollout hasn’t reached you yet. The update is server-side on Apple’s part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntVI9F"&gt;Be aware that lossless audio files take up considerably more storage when downloaded and also burn through more data when streamed. You can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dig into all of the technical details and FAQs here&lt;/a&gt;. The standard AAC streaming remains the default unless you switch your preference to lossless in the Music app section of iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jLxaqEHt9HvibHzZbTGQ4GIAAVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644327/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.29.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KtBl5u"&gt;Apple has said that over 20 million songs will be available in lossless quality at launch, with the entire Apple Music catalog of over 75 million tracks going lossless by the end of 2021. Lossless audio is exclusive to Apple Music and requires a subscription; it’s not available for purchase, nor can you upgrade purchased music or get it through iTunes Match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJVR6W"&gt;Lossless audio is available on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV 4K. Support for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448933/apple-music-lossless-homepod-mini-support-confirmed"&gt;HomePod and HomePod Mini will be added&lt;/a&gt; after a future software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPqQ5z"&gt;Today is the first time you can also try out spatial audio on Apple Music. Millions of tracks now offer immersive, Dolby Atmos-powered mixes that Apple claims deliver “true multidimensional sound and clarity.” There will be a much smaller selection of spatial audio tracks than lossless ones, however, with Apple promising “thousands” of spatial audio tracks on day one with more to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mSedzkSZUNzQ71LfbnFwKsTius0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644334/IMG_2586.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAi6CM"&gt;The company has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewMultiRoom%3FfcId%3D1561370672&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523228%2Fapple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put together several playlists&lt;/a&gt; to showcase the spatial audio Atmos experience across different music genres. Other companies like Tidal and Amazon are also offering these “surround sound” audio formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCxV1w"&gt;Both features now come included as part of the standard Apple Music subscription. More and more music services are offering lossless audio, and those that already were — like Amazon Music HD — are dropping the extra fees they’d previously charged to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Apple’s Siri blaze through requests with on-device processing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PTjC3qGo-lVdNte0jv5Cyho9MHA=/223x0:2464x1494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420125/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_4.20.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7EPcG"&gt;During the privacy segment of WWDC, Apple talked about moving Siri’s processing from the cloud onto your device, using the “Neural Engine” built into Apple silicon. While having the voice processing happen on your phone instead of one of Apple’s servers is obviously better for privacy, it can also help speed up performance and reliability, as Apple showed off in its demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i0d9M0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Siri_on_Device|102461" data-volume-uuid="fe0397997" data-volume-id="102461" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power of on-device learning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKbVYO"&gt;Now let’s see how fast it is when I try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35k77u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's the same Siri demo Apple did, but without on-device processing &lt;a href="https://t.co/wLivWJa06p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wLivWJa06p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1402060984739500048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNhEBc"&gt;Compared to my demo, Apple’s is decidedly more snappy — partially because I don’t have to deactivate Airplane Mode each time I turn it on. (My phone still requires an internet connection for the requests that come after, but the on-device model doesn’t.) Full disclosure: my demo took a few takes, and the first few times the phone did warn me that turning on Airplane Mode would make Siri inaccessible, and I had to tap the switch that turns it off, since I couldn’t do it with my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLXOZp"&gt;Apple processing Siri requests on-device should help its users be more confident about the privacy of their data: back in 2019, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932064/apple-siri-private-conversation-recording-explanation-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;contractors were listening to some Siri requests&lt;/a&gt;, something that wouldn’t happen if those requests were being handled by your phone alone. While Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;tried to make that situation right&lt;/a&gt; by being more transparent and making Siri recordings opt-in, handling more Siri requests on the phone is a good way to make the service a little more trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime employees allege gender inequality and workplace harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="UK Daily Life 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrAhUyrbcI_ojsk93Vn-xYsmtkQ=/0x47:4442x3008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420020/1320349635.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pTRWNz"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-management-is-aggressive-dominated-by-men-leaked-memo-2021-6"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; citing an internal letter to Amazon’s human resources department alleges mistreatment of women within Amazon’s Prime membership division, including but not limited to harassment and disproportionate growth opportunities for men versus women at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30V4sm"&gt;Citing a letter to a former head of diversity and inclusion, as well as accounts from 11 former and current workers within the Prime unit, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-management-is-aggressive-dominated-by-men-leaked-memo-2021-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the Prime team had been anonymously accused in March of being “institutionally biased against women.” The memo’s author — whose identity Insider says it independently verified but did not name in its report — described a culture in which women were often overlooked for promotions, demeaned and condescended to, and “more likely to be performance managed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99tDEJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;pointed to several other instances of apparent institutional inequality at the corporate level within the company. Earlier this year, for example, five women who worked for the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;filed discrimination lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; alleging experiences involving harassment as well as race and gender discrimination. The &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;report didn’t specify a specific time period for the allegations laid out in the anonymous memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCJUd"&gt;The March memo was reportedly sent to Amazon’s head of equity, diversity, and inclusion Kristen Puchek, who departed the company in April. When reached for comment about allegations of gender inequality and the letter in question, an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement by email that the “claims do not reflect the culture of Amazon or the Prime team,” adding that the Prime organization has worked to “foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture in which all employees feel supported and successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4X1SpE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9304037"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vMqxN"&gt;“Representation amongst women has increased on the team in recent years and improving the representation of women in senior leadership roles remains a top priority,” the spokesperson said. “In addition to inspecting how we hire, develop, and promote employees, the Prime leadership team has set aggressive goals to continue our organization’s progress such as doubling the number of women in leadership roles and focusing on the retention of women at the Senior Manager level and above in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cRLKt"&gt;In a statement to&lt;em&gt; Insider&lt;/em&gt;, the company appeared to push back on the claims. A spokesperson told the outlet that 18 women on the Prime membership team had been promoted during the last year, adding that promotions for women were equal to those for men within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYqKvg"&gt;Amazon certainly sounds like it wants to support women, but there can often be a gulf between what it says and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22386992/amazon-is-finally-realizing-it-has-a-labor-problem"&gt;what we’ve historically seen&lt;/a&gt; from the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple may have done the coolest drag and drop demo ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbgrOPtzSha9-HPDM1b-B_rOoSk=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420000/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DnqUki"&gt;At today’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021#comments"&gt;showed off its new version of macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and with it a feature called Universal Control, which lets you use your Mac’s mouse or trackpad to control the cursor on an iPad or another Mac’s screen, reaching into and across multiple devices. On paper it doesn’t sound that groundbreaking, but Craig Federighi did something really cool during the demo: he moved his cursor onto an iPad, then clicked on a photo and dragged it across two other computers to drop it into a Final Cut timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sJQBvt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-109" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is called Universal Control, and could be incredible if it actually works this well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWTb9E"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foptions%2Fpage%2Fflow-multi-device-control&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s Flow&lt;/a&gt; and programs like &lt;a href="https://symless.com/synergy"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt; have similarly allowed users to easily jump between computers, it’s usually not this impressive in real life — some solutions require special hardware, some don’t support actually dragging and dropping, and some have complicated setups. Apple’s version seems seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqP3qM"&gt;It is worth noting that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few small caveats for Universal Control — it will only work with three devices (so Apple was showing its full capabilities in this demo), and it won’t work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;every device getting the new versions of macOS and iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWU90M"&gt;Here’s the list of Macs can initiate Universal Control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AwsDZf"&gt;MacBook Pro (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v0RuhF"&gt;MacBook (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YFdhnx"&gt;MacBook Air (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="97MVZg"&gt;iMac (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z9rufZ"&gt;iMac (5K Retina 27-inch, Late 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekWpqQ"&gt;Mac mini (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2hijKT"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NTw2Sn"&gt;Mac Pro 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zCaeNQ"&gt;As for iPads, it’ll work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k0tMIM"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGXx8i"&gt;iPad Air (3rd generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XfIcyX"&gt;iPad (6th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WwSl4n"&gt;iPad mini (5th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hybx8"&gt;While the feature does work with iPads, it has to be initiated on the Mac — if you were hoping to sling a file over to your Mac using an Apple Pencil or your finger, you’re out of luck (as fun as that sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wruU5g"&gt;Apple says the feature doesn’t require any setup (besides having your two devices being logged in with the same Apple ID and having Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on), but until we actually use it there’s no way to know how quick and reliable it might be. Will it work every single time you set your iPad down next to your iMac, or will you find yourself tapping your fingers on the desk waiting for them to realize that they should be communicating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIJyoQ"&gt;Obviously we’ll have to see how Universal Control works in real life, but the demo makes it seem like everything, as the saying goes, just works — Federighi brought the computers close to each other, and could hop between keyboards, mice, and screens. It makes for an incredible demo, which hints at the eternal dream of computing: being able to just use all your devices together, no matter their form factor or OS (though, of course, this version of the dream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;ignores non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new App Store guidelines put scammers and bounty hunters on notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek2fG15nxoop_N9tul87JjPv-hU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69419904/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZfJNX"&gt;Apple has just updated &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;its App Store Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the document that tells iPhone and iPad developers what kind of behavior the company will tolerate and where it’s likely to reject apps or crackdown after the fact — and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/"&gt;as TechCrunch reports&lt;/a&gt;, many of today’s changes are aimed directly at scammers and fraudsters who prey on Apple users. But not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BClSYl"&gt;I just put the entire thing through a diff checker to show you exactly what’s changed. &lt;a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/xwG6ItKe"&gt;Check out all the differences here&lt;/a&gt; for yourself, or read on for the highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fZ5PXa"&gt;Apple is warning fraudsters it’s coming for their entire accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="31KzO4"&gt;Apple already had a section titled “5.6 Developer Code of Conduct” that warned devs not to “prey on users or attempt to rip off customers” among a laundry list of other bad behavior. Now, it also includes two clear warnings and a possibility of redemption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GmaUjZ"&gt;Repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj7GKi"&gt;Your Developer Program account will be terminated if you engage in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the Developer Code of Conduct. To restore your account, you may provide a written statement detailing the improvements you plan to make. If your plan is approved by Apple and we confirm the changes have been made, your account may be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OsdV8m"&gt;Apple will count slippery identities, fake reviews, negative reviews, and other warning signs against a developer’s standing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="We2Way"&gt;These three sections of the Developer Code of Conduct are brand-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.2"&gt;5.6.2 Developer Identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2h8jt"&gt;Providing verifiable information to Apple and customers is critical to customer trust. Your representation of yourself, your business, and your offerings on the App Store must be accurate. The information you provide must be truthful, relevant, and up-to-date so that Apple and customers understand who they are engaging with and can contact you regarding any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.3"&gt;5.6.3 Discovery Fraud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M767K2"&gt;Participating in the App Store requires integrity and a commitment to building and maintaining customer trust. Manipulating any element of the App Store customer experience such as charts, search reviews, or referrals to your app erodes customer trust and is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.4"&gt;5.6.4 App Quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMnmrY"&gt;Customers expect the highest quality from the App Store, and maintaining high quality content, services, and experiences promotes customer trust. Indications that this expectation is not being met include excessive customer reports about concerns with your app, such as negative customer reviews, and excessive refund requests. Inability to maintain high quality may be a factor in deciding whether a developer is abiding by the Developer Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="T9xo1B"&gt;Misleading marketing is also not allowed, up to and including bait-and-switch pricing. These bolded parts of section 2.3.1 are new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bSCaos"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting&lt;/strong&gt; content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) &lt;strong&gt;or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;App Store&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and termination of your developer account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mscnuT"&gt;All of this seems directly aimed at Apple’s scam problem, where the most profitable company in the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;hasn’t managed to stop egregious scams that are so obvious you could easily find them yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and where &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/"&gt;found 2 percent of the company’s top grossing apps were fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s unclear whether enforcement will improve alongside these new rules. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;apparently didn’t get an answer to that in its briefing with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s8VjOY"&gt;Bounty hunter apps are on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2vmqfs"&gt;Remember when Citizen’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;encouraged his users to hunt down an innocent person by offering a $30,000 reward?&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s new rule seems designed to tamp down on vigilante justice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jzFXD4"&gt;1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Lt4Pz"&gt;Apps for reporting alleged criminal activity must involve local law enforcement, and can only be offered in countries where such involvement is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="y3iPC8"&gt;Hookup apps are also on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CopHmF"&gt;I’m not sure which app made the headlines this time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4672800/bang-with-friends-returns-ios-app-store-down"&gt;but Apple’s tangled with this issue&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WNB1rb"&gt;1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” &lt;strong&gt;This includes “hookup” apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="F6tnLX"&gt;Legal weed is OK, but it’s gotta be legal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JXfBvo"&gt;Weed apps have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/13/8032867/massroots-back-in-app-store"&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;-and-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21274431/pax-web-app-era-controls-apple-store-ban"&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone for many years, and not for lack of rules. This is more about letting developers know that a certain narrowly defined category is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ehneBs"&gt;(ix) Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, &lt;strong&gt;legal cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. &lt;strong&gt;Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enJ7Tx"&gt;You don’t need to give Apple a cut of physical gift card sales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TuvjUR"&gt;Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;it doesn’t take a cut of physical purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Were physical gift cards an exception? Either way, you don’t have to pay now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RsQnA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital&lt;/strong&gt; gift cards, certificates, vouchers, and coupons which can be redeemed for digital goods or services can only be sold in your app using in-app purchase. &lt;strong&gt;Physical gift cards that are sold within an app and then mailed to customers may use payment methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pal2sA"&gt;Apple’s most arbitrary rules aren’t gone, but tamped down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpj2U8"&gt;Of all the rules in the App Store, the “don’t include irrelevant information” is probably the easiest to abuse; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;developers like ProtonMail have told us&lt;/a&gt; it’s used to justify removing an app when there aren’t any actually relevant rules. It also irks developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut"&gt;who believe they should be able to tell their users&lt;/a&gt; about the hoops they have to jump through to get into the store. It’s not gone, but it’s shorter now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZcitE5"&gt;2.3.10 Make sure your app is focused on the &lt;strong&gt;iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS&lt;/strong&gt; experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information, &lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NEFvAI"&gt;Also, Apple’s clearer now that — with certain kinds of apps, and outside the app itself, and only if you get their contact info elsewhere somehow — developers actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tell their users that they can pay outside of Apple’s store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rO4nkx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers cannot use information obtained within the app to target individual users outside of the app to use purchasing methods other than in-app purchase (such as sending an individual user an email about other purchasing methods after that individual signs up for an account within the app). Developers can send communications outside of the app to their user base about purchasing methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WMJC8f"&gt;That doesn’t fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;the company’s anti-steering rules in the least, which came up prominently during the Epic-Apple trial,&lt;/a&gt; but it does make edge cases clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxWOm8"&gt;Apple wants apps to let users be free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DUkFJK"&gt;5.1.1 (v) Account Sign-In: If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. &lt;strong&gt;If your app supports account creation, you must also offer account deletion within the app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tYwJs9"&gt;Neat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tVl89j"&gt;Oh, and Roblox is still totally not a game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="c3kFx4"&gt;This section is all-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1.2.1"&gt;1.2.1 Creator Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4YwhV"&gt;Apps which feature content from a specific community of users called “creators” are a great opportunity if properly moderated. These apps present a singular, unified experience for customers to interact with various kinds of creator content. They offer tools and programs to help this community of non-developer creators to author, share, and monetize user-generated experiences. These experiences must not change the core features and functionality of the native app—rather, they add content to those structured experiences. These experiences are not native “apps” coded by developers—they are content within the app itself and are treated as user-generated content by App Review. Such creator content may include video, articles, audio, and even casual games. The App Store supports apps offering such user-generated content so long as they follow all Guidelines, including Guideline 1.2 for moderating user-generated content and Guideline 3.1.1 for payments and in-app purchases. Creator apps should share the age rating of the highest age-rated creator content available in the app, and communicate to users which content requires additional purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7CBbOt"&gt;If you’re wondering what Apple is on about here, here’s the TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCl0b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple doesn’t want to allow cloud gaming services like Stadia and xCloud into the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, so it told everyone each game in a collection of games had to be individually approved — even though that rule didn’t exist until Apple retroactively added it. Then everyone pointed out Roblox is a collection of games that weren’t individually approved, LOL. Apple argued at trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;that Roblox isn’t a game&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;Roblox amusingly agreed&lt;/a&gt;. Now Apple is now carving out a brand new category of “Creator Content” to cement why Roblox is OK, while other game platforms that contain multitudes are not. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3 beyond the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm, GPS): $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793219252543422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$199&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS): $269 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals060721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$279&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS): $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793385278132874" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;399&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793219252543422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, both &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-42mm-Silver-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6Xq5N5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version of the SE for $269 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger GPS model, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have several color configurations of the 44mm model for $299, a 4-percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwogLj"&gt;If you are looking for the 40mm model with GPS, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red version for $329&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. It’s also currently available in several colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793385278132874" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7LoAo"&gt;If you prefer the larger model, the 44mm GPS configuration is also currently discounted to $359 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, again, assuming you don’t mind the red version. You can also pick it up in a range of different colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F896099320%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793655975172725" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $359.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FuboTV’s fantastic live TV streaming service finally arrives on LG TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OU290gtPbBHcDit-xEHSXMeNDK0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69419097/LG_CX_Angled_Press_Shot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fNbulC"&gt;FuboTV, one of the best over-the-top services for sports enthusiasts, is finally arriving on newer LG Smart TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhQuXE"&gt;While the app was already available on many set-top boxes like the Apple TV or Chromecast, it’s now available on LG’s native webOS platform on 2018–2021 Smart TV models (including LG’s fantastic OLEDs). That’ll give any consumers with newer LG models the ability to access the service’s 100-plus sports and entertainment channels directly from their sets, rather than having to rely on a third-party device for access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iePwM"&gt;“Over 90 percent of FuboTV’s viewership is on the big screen and today’s launch on LG Smart TVs expands FuboTV to even more smart and connected TV platforms,” Mike Berkley, FuboTV’s chief product officer, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HJtZV"&gt;Starting at $65 per month, FuboTV offers one of the most robust catalogs of sports-specific programming, though it has plenty of entertainment and news channels peppered in as well. ESPN, ESPN 2, Olympic Channel, CBS Sports Network, Big Ten Network, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, and beIN Sports channels are among those available on the service’s base tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SydJsH"&gt;But FuboTV really shines with its sport package add-ons, which offer more diversity in additional sports channels than similarly priced live TV services like Hulu with Live TV or YouTube TV. That said, regional sports networks are &lt;a href="https://support.fubo.tv/hc/en-us/articles/115005322088-What-Regional-Sports-Networks-are-available-on-fuboTV-"&gt;fairly limited&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s a persistent problem that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hulu-becomes-the-latest-service-to-lose-fox-regional-sp-1845456794"&gt;plagues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/youtube-tv-is-losing-regional-sports-channels-because-c-1845231335"&gt;nearly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; OTT live streaming services — not just FuboTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foD9Tn"&gt;Users on LG Smart TVs will now be able to easily record an entire series with a single click, customize their guide with their favorite channels, and add up to six user profiles, each of which will support personalized recommendations and user-specific recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbeccG"&gt;Unfortunately, one of FuboTV’s best features, the MultiView tool that supports up to four &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529068/fubotv-multiview-four-channels-apple-tv"&gt;simultaneous channel streams&lt;/a&gt; at once, is still limited to the Apple TV, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But hey, at least you’ll be able to use the app on your fancy LG OLED without the help of a third-party box, stick, or dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
