    <title>2020’s best epic was the X-Men’s struggle to build a better world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mioGMUjo7Lq0V1-IggvhldfzyX0=/0x630:1280x1483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615776/801294._SX1280_QL80_TTD_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8DxIa"&gt;For the first time in what feels like ages, the entertainment I looked forward to most was a handful of monthly comic books about the X-Men. Week after week this fall — a time absolutely &lt;em&gt;lousy&lt;/em&gt; with great books, movies, TV, and video games — what I really wanted most was to pour over words and pictures about Marvel Comics’ deep roster of mutants, and a story about them unlike any I’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na73Oa"&gt;It can’t be understated how bold and interesting X-Men comics are right now. Following a soft reboot in the twin 2019 miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman with art by R.B. Silva and Pepe Larraz, &lt;em&gt;House of X &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Powers of X &lt;/em&gt;(the best place to start reading), the mutants of the Marvel Universe have banded together to form the mutant nation of Krakoa. They have decided they are tired waiting for humanity at large to accept their existence and will instead build a place for themselves, whether or not humanity at large likes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zxyUlV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Did you honestly think that we were going to sit around forever and just take it?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1h8igv"&gt;These mutants — former heroes of the X-Men superhero team and their former adversaries alike — have banded together on the terrain of a living island (also named Krakoa) to begin the messy business of building a nation. There is a new language, new rituals, new creeds — the building blocks of a culture are being made in real time. The results have been among the best comics of the year, full of political intrigue, love stories unfolding across millennia, and yeah, even a whole series (&lt;em&gt;Maruaders&lt;/em&gt; by Gerry Duggan and a lineup of killer artists) about pirates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV5AEc"&gt;This messy, complicated new status quo is comics at its best, rich with possibility and things to daydream about. It even made a 22-part crossover — the absolute worst stunt that modern superhero comics love to pull — utterly compelling. &lt;em&gt;X of Swords&lt;/em&gt;, as this crossover was called, swept this newfound nation into a magical struggle in an unknown world, as the X-Men were forced into a tournament where they had to fight challengers with swords. This was the premise that was supposed to fuel &lt;em&gt;twenty-two whole comic books,&lt;/em&gt; and they absolutely did it, subverting every expectation about what a story like that could entail along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8SoMN"&gt;Most of the fun of these comics comes from seeing how the wider world reacts to Krakoa’s existence, and some of the conflicts are &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;. In one early &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt; story, Krakoa is invaded by an elderly trio of radical super-botanists named Hordeculture (seriously). In &lt;em&gt;X-Men #4&lt;/em&gt; — one of the first and very best comics released in 2020 — the leaders of Krakoa go to Davos and dress down the economic leaders of the world over dinner. In the more action-oriented &lt;em&gt;X-Force&lt;/em&gt;, Krakoa is threatened by international black ops squads sent by people who see Krakoa as a ticking time bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L0AH4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For this moment, they just feel like stories made for anyone curious enough to read them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRnXQv"&gt;But mostly, in a year full of news that was a nonstop assault for anyone but a few — mostly white, mostly wealthy — X-Men comics were a joy, simply because they’re a story about characters who, by definition (every big X-Men story must note how they are hated and feared), are always &lt;em&gt;losing&lt;/em&gt; and finally showed them refusing to play the same broken game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPffCL"&gt;“The world has told me that I was less when I knew that I was more,” Cyclops says, early on in &lt;em&gt;House of X&lt;/em&gt;. “Did you honestly think that we were going to sit around forever and just take it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hxmZK"&gt;Part of what makes the X-Men endure is that there’s a certain malleability to the mutant metaphor. For years, fans and writers have compared the X-Men to the struggle for Civil Rights; more recently, the metaphor has been embraced as an exploration of queerness. No matter how you read them, if you’re from &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of marginalized group, it’s easy to identify with the seemingly futile struggle of having to advocate for yourself and others in spaces hostile to you, spaces you should belong in if it weren’t for systemic injustices that have shut you out. I have tired of the fight for diversity in spaces that are only interested in the optics of diversity. There is something cathartic and beautiful in a story where Cyclops — the face of the X-Men for just about all 60 years of their existence — says we’re all done taking it. He’s found an answer he believes in, and he’s going to do the work to make it real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgYOlg"&gt;It also helps that, currently, the X-Men are a comics-only concern. Sure, they’re still owned by Disney and since &lt;em&gt;The New Mutants &lt;/em&gt;came out this year, their previous film franchise is not even that far in the rearview. But they’re also not yet a slide on some presentation about the next four years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, at least for a little while. They’re not a reminder of their owner’s stranglehold on the wider entertainment industry. For this moment, they just feel like stories made for anyone curious enough to read them. Stories for people trying to find an answer that they believe in, to build a world they want to make real.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, and more ViacomCBS channels coming to Hulu with Live TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spongebob Squarepants" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUui6bRt6IaFw9nkUCDJBy4L84k=/16x0:622x404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615772/Spongebob_Squarepants.1419965039.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmZGom"&gt;More than 14 ViacomCBS networks, including Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, and Comedy Central are coming to Hulu with Live TV, the company announced today. Hulu is not announcing a price hike with the new additions at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThTAl1"&gt;This marks the first time that many of ViacomCBS’s networks are being made available to Hulu with Live TV subscribers. Other networks that come with the package include Paramount Network, VH1, CMT, Nick Jr., TV Land, BET Her, MTV2, NickToons, TeenNick, and MTV Classic. The multiyear expanded deal also ensures that Hulu with Live TV customers can retain access to CBS Sports Network, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, The CW, and Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9YF9B"&gt;“Hulu continues to be a great partner, and this agreement ensures that Hulu + Live TV subscribers are now able to enjoy the full breadth of our leading content across news, sports and entertainment for the first time,” said Ray Hopkins, president of US networks distribution at ViacomCBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35uASf"&gt;Prior to ViacomCBS and Hulu’s partnership, ViacomCBS made a deal with YouTube for its live TV offering, YouTube TV, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249931/viacomcbs-youtubetv-nickelodeon-mtv-comedy-central-streaming"&gt;carry the same suite of networks&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the addition led some industry insiders to believe a price hike for YouTube TV was likely imminent. History certainly set the precedent: YouTube TV saw a $5 price increase in 2018 (from $35 to $40 a month) after Turner networks (TNT, TBS, CNN, truTV, Cartoon Network, and Adult Swim) &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/last-chance-for-35-youtube-tv-price-jumps-on-tuesday/"&gt;were added&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube TV was hit with price hikes once again (an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304871/youtube-tv-april-2019-price-increase-discovery-hgtv"&gt;additional $10 to $50 a month&lt;/a&gt;) not long after adding a number of Discovery channels and local feeds from four major broadcasters in April 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JPt9kz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cord cutting — once designed as the cheaper and better option — is becoming more expensive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DryUIl"&gt;Those concerns turned out to be true. Not long after YouTube TV started carrying ViacomCBS channels, the service’s monthly cost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;sharply rose to $65 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Expecting a Hulu with Live TV price hike in the near future isn’t too out of left field. The only saving grace is that Hulu with Live TV already saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;price hike in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; (going from $55 a month to $65, on par with YouTube TV). Still, annual price hikes for virtual live TV services have become par for the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKw6tE"&gt;That’s especially true when said virtual TV providers are growing. Hulu with Live TV has more than 4 million subscribers and is tied into Disney’s growing suite of streaming services. CEO Bob Chapek spoke about Disney’s commitment to Hulu with Live TV on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;recent earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, and the Hulu team laid out plans for its future &lt;a href="https://tvrev.com/disney-investor-day-shows-path-to-put-all-content-under-one-umbrella/"&gt;at Disney’s big investor day&lt;/a&gt; in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciIYew"&gt;While Disney executives continue to reiterate their commitment to Hulu’s live TV offering, there’s no question that cord cutting — once designed as the cheaper and better option — is becoming more expensive with each passing year. Still, being able to cancel and being able to switch services whenever might be more appealing to some customers than being caught in cable’s messy web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro leak in hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32kh87K34j9HQYjCG41FR3ifgjk=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615536/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Slang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXMsiQ"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, have leaked again in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;hands on video from YouTuber Digital Slang&lt;/a&gt;. As well as confirming the earbuds’ specs, and giving us an idea of how they look in the real word, the video also delivers some first impressions on how they perform. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digital_slang/status/1345407016832008192"&gt;YouTuber said&lt;/a&gt; he obtained the unannounced earbuds via a seller on Facebook, where &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/not-out-yet-someone-selling-galaxy-buds-pro-facebook/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; others have also been selling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09HL7R"&gt;Echoing previous reports, Digital Slang says that the earbuds have a dust and water resistance rating of IPX7, support wireless charging, and feature active noise-cancellation. There’s also a transparency mode which allows the wearer to hear what’s going on around them while wearing the earbuds. According to Digital Slang, the earbuds’ transparency mode is among the best he’s heard from a pair of earbuds, but the noise-cancellation falls short of what’s offered by Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5eeW0Rv_eAmcUQ5r5MVu2dPZ7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22195070/Ep7qr_SUYAIMGqR.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643" target="_blank"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A spec sheet for the earbuds recently leaked, showing their specs in comparison to Samsung’s other buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPTa1k"&gt;The hands on video adds to a host of details that have leaked about the earbuds over the past month. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22054757/galaxy-buds-pro-leaked-images-renders-rounded-design-case"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;3D animations&lt;/a&gt;, and even a reported $199 price tag thanks to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;spec sheet leaked by WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. Battery life will apparently sit at up to 8 hours from the earbuds themselves, rising to 28 hours when paired with the charging case, putting them in a similar ballpark to the specs of Samsung’s previous true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9ZESs"&gt;All signs point towards the Galaxy Buds Pro being unveiled at Samsung’s next Unpacked event, which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;due to take place on January 14th&lt;/a&gt;. Other devices expected at the event include the Galaxy S21 lineup of smartphones, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;Samsung’s Tile-like tracking devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Images of Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra’s optional stylus and compatible case leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdequBrQeAgmHk1V9hBD7cXTy7w=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615395/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725103_0_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case for the S21 Ultra with space for an optional  S Pen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="le0KRq"&gt;Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung’s previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that’s a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under €40 (around $49). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBEhCB"&gt;This phone case is necessary because the S21 Ultra is rumored to support the S Pen but &lt;a href="https://winfuture.mobi/news/119995"&gt;reportedly won’t have a dedicated slot&lt;/a&gt; to store it unlike Samsung’s Note devices. The stylus is reportedly an optional accessory for the S21 Ultra, rather than something that comes in the box like with the Note phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhnR3BnQbLiQ8g-kvF9TL0B_UBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22212392/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725152_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus accessory looks a lot like Samsung’s previous S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ1Syy"&gt;Rumors that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will work with the S Pen have been around for at least a month, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself&lt;/a&gt; even hinted that support was on the way when its president of mobile TM Roh said the company would add some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” to other devices in its lineup. At the end of last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; all-but-confirmed that stylus support was on the way for the upcoming phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQQ2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the S21 Ultra will support many of the same S Pen features as previous Note devices. It will reportedly have a pressure-sensitive tip, gesture controls via an accelerometer, and controls for playing and pausing videos or remotely taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6tt9p"&gt;Reports of stylus support coming to the S21 Ultra have coincided with rumors that Samsung was preparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;discontinue its Note lineup&lt;/a&gt;, which counts stylus support among its defining features. However, this has reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;disputed by one Samsung official&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqgnK"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to be one of three devices that’ll make up the S21 lineup, alongside the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Beyond its stylus support, other reports have claimed the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear camera array will include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189305/samsung-s21-ultra-spec-leak-cameras"&gt;two telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; as well as a main 108-megapixel camera. Leaked video teasers suggest it’ll have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;curved screen&lt;/a&gt; (compared to flat screens for the other two S21 handsets) and redesigned camera bump compared to the previous generation S20 Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; it’ll have a 6.8-inch 120Hz display, and a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt7Jux"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Samsung has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that its next Unpacked launch event will take place on January 14th, during which it’s expected to announce the new Galaxy S21 range and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;a new Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; alongside the heavily leaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoAUZK"&gt;A group of Google workers &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/press/releases/2021-01-04-code-cwa-google-union/"&gt;have announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to unionize with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; will be open to all employees and contractors at Google’s parent company. Its goal will be to tackle ongoing issues like pay disparity, retaliation, and controversial government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9KRho"&gt;“This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,” said Nicki Anselmo, a Google program manager. “From fighting the ‘real names’ policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who’ve committed sexual harassment, we’ve seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOKXpa"&gt;Google’s work on Project Maven, an effort to use AI to improve targeted drone strikes, sparked protests among employees who saw the work as unethical. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html"&gt;the company decided not to renew its contract with the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;ended its forced arbitration policy&lt;/a&gt; after 20,000 workers staged a walkout to protest former executive Andy Rubin getting a $90 million exit package after he was credibly accused of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1K2pC"&gt;Now that the union effort is public, organizers will likely launch a series of campaigns to rally votes from Google workers. Prior to the announcement, about 230 Google employees and contractors had signed cards in support of the union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GhJfG"&gt;Arranged as &lt;a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/members-only-unions-can-they-help-revitalize-workplace-democracy/?agreed=1"&gt;a members-only union&lt;/a&gt;, the new organization won’t seek collective bargaining rights to negotiate a new contract with the company. Instead, the Alphabet Workers Union will only represent employees who voluntarily join. That structure will also allow it to represent all employees who seek to participate — including temps, vendors, and contractors (known internally as TVCs) who would be excluded by labor law from conventional collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMStox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google contractors have long complained about unequal treatment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7gOax"&gt;Google contractors have long complained about their unequal treatment compared to full-time staff. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;While they make up the majority of Google’s workforce&lt;/a&gt;, they often lack the benefits of salaried employees. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;roughly 80 Google contractors in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; voted to join the United Steelworkers union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWx9u3"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union plans to unionize with CWA Local 1400, which represents workers in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQBP25"&gt;The news comes one month after the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint alleging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;Google illegally fired two workers who were organizing employee protests&lt;/a&gt;. The employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, were organizing against the company’s decision to work with IRI Consultants, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;a firm famous for its anti-union efforts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGORxY"&gt;It also follows the firing of prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru in December. In a press release announcing the union, the Alphabet Workers Union wrote: “The firing has caused outrage from thousands of us, including Black and Brown workers who are heartbroken by the company’s actions and unsure of their future at Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihVycE"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;employees at the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter voted to unionize with the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153&lt;/a&gt;, as reported by NBC. It was the first time white-collar employees in the tech industry had unionized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoyGy6"&gt;If the union effort at Google is successful, members say they will commit one percent of their annual compensation to the union. The money will go toward paying legal fees and organizing staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg9TuA"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said: “We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support.  But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5rpqZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8:53AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added Google statement and additional clarity on AWU’s members-only status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65InG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9aHJt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the US, British judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protestors At Court Supporting Julian Assange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57Obg8H7zWPBMqhu9nv_OMibKA8=/0x0:4444x2963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615347/1201406239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kI4ySt"&gt;A judge in the United Kingdom has denied Julian Assange’s extradition to the United States, where he faces espionage charges for his work running WikiLeaks. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/04/julian-assange-cannot-be-extradited-to-us-british-judge-rules"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the ruling was delivered in a criminal court this morning, with the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-judge-rejects-u-s-request-to-extradite-wikileaks-julian-assange-11609758350?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporting that the judge noted that the risk of suicide is too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaZ8Cw"&gt;Assange will now remain in British custody pending a bail application, and the US government is free to proceed with an appeal against the decision. This particular ruling is only related to the US request for extradition under an extradition treaty between the UK and US. The full ruling is &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange/"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9UZE6"&gt;Initially detained by the UK for violating his bail conditions, Assange faces hacking and espionage charges in the US related to a string of Wikileaks publications that the US Justice Department called “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzJ6t0"&gt;The case has raised significant free speech concerns, as &lt;a href="http://www.medialaw.org/component/k2/item/4801-is-assange-entitled-to-full-first-amendment-protection?"&gt;many legal scholars&lt;/a&gt; see the government’s case as punishing the Wikileaks founder for publishing information. The extradition has also been unusually high-profile, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/22/protesters-gather-on-eve-of-julian-assange-extradition-hearing"&gt;a number of UK protests&lt;/a&gt; in support of Assange and opposing extradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDFBC1"&gt;Assange was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/19/donald-trump-offered-julian-assange-pardon-russia-hack-wikileaks"&gt;reportedly considered for a pardon&lt;/a&gt; by outgoing president Donald Trump, who benefitted from Wikileaks’ DNC releases during the 2016 campaign. However, Assange was not included in a December round of appeals, and it’s unclear whether Trump plans to intervene in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft planning ‘sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxczGH-_tBQ-WIJ1IIDzRFWYTLU=/83x0:2243x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615341/windows10ui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C1YHXf"&gt;Microsoft is planning a “sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows” that is designed to signal to users of the operating system that “Windows is BACK.” That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/922184/Senior-Software-Engineer"&gt;job listing&lt;/a&gt; posted by Microsoft recently, advertising for a software engineering role in the Windows Core User Experiences team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LtzHK3"&gt;“On this team, you’ll work with our key platform, Surface, and OEM partners to orchestrate and deliver a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows experiences to signal to our customers that Windows is BACK and ensure that Windows is considered the best user OS experience for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TEJcY4"&gt;Microsoft quietly removed references to this “sweeping visual rejuvenation” this morning, after several Windows enthusiasts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BartokGabi17/status/1345874056382455810"&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; the job listing over the weekend. While Microsoft has been promising visual overhauls of Windows 10 for years, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design system&lt;/a&gt;, rumors suggest the company is planning big user interface changes for Windows that will debut later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H56NalfLS4RgkKhRvuZHlDh1YDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20063260/newwindows10startmenu.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Windows 10 Start menu from 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msnClx"&gt;Codenamed Sun Valley, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-sun-valley-ui-october-2021-update"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on these UI changes back in October. Microsoft is planning to overhaul the Start menu, File Explorer, and built-in apps in Windows 10 to modernize them and make the UI more consistent. Some of the UI changes will also &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/3549"&gt;include updates&lt;/a&gt; to the sliders, buttons, and controls that are found throughout Windows and the apps that run on the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj2Ydu"&gt;Microsoft is also working on improving its tablet mode experience, particularly how devices like the company’s Surface line switch between mouse / trackpad usage and and touch-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFP8Cg"&gt;Microsoft has been working on improving its UI consistency throughout Windows in recent years, and a lot of that will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;found in Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;. The company also rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;new Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, followed by some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;minor tweaks to the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bj1u"&gt;All of this work comes as Microsoft has signaled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358339/microsoft-windows-reorg-2020-panos-panay-windows-development"&gt;renewed interest in Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Surface chief Panos Panay took on the additional role of looking after Windows back in October, after previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187384/microsoft-windows-10-new-file-explorer-start-menu-context-menu-teaser-video-changes"&gt;teasing some additional Windows 10 UI changes&lt;/a&gt; last year. After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;jump in Windows usage&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, it feels like Microsoft might be more ready than ever to give its operating system the UI polish it has been promising for years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This LG display transforms from flat to curved for immersive gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxjRmiuB-5G6HjHBj3XGurrmgOk=/1x0:6400x4266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615248/44218753863586400_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curved screens can offer a more immersive experience while gaming.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wv0KBo"&gt;LG Display’s &lt;a href="http://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/prcenter/newsList"&gt;latest prototype&lt;/a&gt; is a 48-inch flexible OLED panel that can be bent for gaming or flattened for watching TV. The company has shown off similar bendable TV prototypes before, like when it demonstrated a &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-lg-display-is-cramming-curved-and-bendable-screens-into-every-pa.html#engadget-post-continued-contents:~:text=.%20Then%2C%20and%20this%20might%20still,general%20flight%20information%20and%20duty%2Dfree%20goods."&gt;65-inch TV meant for use inside planes&lt;/a&gt; that could bend into a curve for passengers to watch movies. This model, which is being shown off at this year’s virtual CES, features LG Display’s Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) technology, which vibrates the screen to produce audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmqviV"&gt;The 48-inch TV could potentially offer the immersive benefits of a curved screen while gaming without forcing you to live with a curved screen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439362/samsung-curved-tv-review-un40k6250af-mistake"&gt;many downsides&lt;/a&gt; when you just want to watch TV. You can briefly see the panel in action at the 19 second mark in LG Display’s video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DSpm0B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4spy-VVPI6E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RnRft"&gt;In terms of specs, LG Display is emphasizing the gaming capabilities of its prototype, which can bend with a radius of up to 1,000mm. It’s got a high refresh rate of 120Hz, a variable refresh rate range that goes from 40Hz to 120Hz, and a response time of 0.1 milliseconds. It’s also able to vibrate its screen to produce sound — a technique that LG Display has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/10/14222986/sony-bravia-oled-lg-display-ces-2017"&gt;previously shown off for its flat panels&lt;/a&gt; — though we imagine most gamers would probably prefer to use headphones or separate speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ySEIU"&gt;This new prototype is LG Display’s latest experiment with flexible OLEDs, which have previously included a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;rollable TV&lt;/a&gt; that packs up into a compact box when not in use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaukgKQVQCuypolI-K9zIF3VOGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22212375/44218596433971096_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display is also showing off transparent OLED panels, which it thinks could be used in restaurants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ihXdub"&gt;LG Display is also showing off a range of use cases for its transparent OLED displays at this year’s virtual CES show. These include a “Smart Bed” with a transparent OLED TV that rises out of its frame, a transparent restaurant display that allows diners to see chefs at work behind it, and train carriage windows that can also display customer information. On the consumer side, LG has also debuted a range of TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203910/lg-qned-mini-led-4k-8k-lcd-tv-announced-ces-2021"&gt;featuring Mini LED display technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi reportedly in talks to sell its shows to Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pl0qBr_VqgOM5mipiu2SejUaIsg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68614488/gblackmon_200403_3960_quibi_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ziikWs"&gt;Failed mobile-first streaming service Quibi is in advanced discussions to sell the rights to its content library to Roku, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-nears-deal-to-buy-rights-to-quibis-content-11609725389"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report doesn’t indicate a potential price for the acquisition, and notes that the two parties may not reach a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzf2ge"&gt;If it were to happen, the deal could give the Roku Channel exclusive access to Quibi’s slate of programming. None of Quibi’s shows ever really took off, but Roku may feel that the content would stand a better chance when available on the best-selling streaming devices in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bynurc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the final days of Quibi","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="exg5Je"&gt;Quibi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt; back in October, just six months after its much-hyped launch. The service was headed by former HP CEO Meg Whitman and former Disney chairman and movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165312/quibi-funding-investors-jeffrey-katzenberg-launch-date-price"&gt;managed to raise almost $2 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; before the app was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGGbMF"&gt;Katzenberg had already tried to get companies including Facebook and NBCUniversal to pick up Quibi programming ahead of its demise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527131/quibi-shutdown-sale-streaming-jeffrey-katzenberg"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVxt62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company. Vox Media also has a deal with Quibi to produce a show, and there were early talks about a &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; show as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="at34Jk"&gt;Samsung will officially be announcing its latest lineup of Galaxy flagship phones — rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra — on January 14th, the company confirmed through invitations to a new Galaxy Unpacked event. The tagline: “Welcome to the Everyday Epic.” The event will kick off at 7AM PT / 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPqWI5"&gt;The company is widely expected to announce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;three new smartphones at the event&lt;/a&gt;, successors to last year’s Galaxy S20 lineup: a pair of matching S21 and S21 Plus phones (that are expected to be largely similar, except for size), and a more premium S21 Ultra model that will offer even better specs and cameras, similar to its 2020 counterpart, in addition to a curved display and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;support for Samsung’s S-Pen stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApD5hc"&gt;There’s not a lot to glean from the event teaser video you can watch at the top of this post, which appears to simply be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;Galaxy S21’s camera module&lt;/a&gt; floating inside a translucent cube. But practically every detail of these new phones already seems to have leaked, including sharper animated GIFs of what those modules should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
