    <title>How to watch today’s Nintendo Direct live stream</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8UMJyH"&gt;If you’re into gaming, you’ll want to know that Nintendo is hosting a 50-minute live stream today that it calls Nintendo Direct, and the company will focus on games coming to the Switch in 2021. This is the first time the company has hosted a full-fledged Nintendo Direct live stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20850031/nintendo-direct-switch-seven-biggest-announcements-news-super-smash-snes-overwatch"&gt;since September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZlig5"&gt;Nintendo already confirmed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1361676737730519042"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announcing information on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&lt;/em&gt; but it did not offer any hints, though there’s a good chance we’ll be hearing about a new character for &lt;a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/"&gt;the game’s second Fighter Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, the live stream will focus on games coming to Nintendo Switch “in the first half of 2021,” leaving fans to speculate what could be shown during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J15ClL"&gt;When does the Nintendo Direct start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;The live stream starts today, February 17th, at 2PM PT / 5PM ET / 10PM GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;Where can I watch the Nintendo Direct?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CBFWFs"&gt;We have embedded the live stream at the top of this post, so you can stay here to watch it when it begins. Otherwise, today’s Nintendo Direct will be available on &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/02-17-2021/"&gt;Nintendo’s official website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ-dE_5el5Q"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVDkl"&gt;Of course, if you miss the stream, you can find coverage of all the Nintendo news here on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky update lets you adopt wild animals as pets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xvqh7WvfBD7HjKNfGjeSDyfyUzw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829784/No_Man_s_Sky_Companions_Screenshot_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zSbe9A"&gt;Hello Games is adding companion animals to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450755/no-mans-sky-origin-expansion-hello-games-sean-murray-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the developer announced a new update that allows players to tame wild creatures, bond with them, and even breed them. “They will travel side-by-side with you as you adventure through the universe both as a friend and as a valuable aide on your voyage,” Hello Games said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W62TJU"&gt;Once tamed, you can feed, play with, and explore with your companions; a “neural harness” transmits their thoughts directly to the player’s communication channels. “Creature personalities are defined by their species and ecosystem, such that no two creatures are alike, and their personalities develop further as you deepen your bond with them,” the developer said. It’s also worth noting that running into other Travellers may set your companion off, making it act frightened or aggressive, if not playful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cK68Vg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2wNFByBo3s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TiWvzU"&gt;Once trained, companions can perform a variety of tasks for their Traveller, from scanning for resources and digging up treasure to hunting fauna and identifying hazards. Players who take good care of their companions may find collectible eggs they can choose to hatch or trade to other players. The update launches today and will also include “significant improvements” for load and warp times on PlayStation 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2EXhQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year, with the companions update kicking off Hello Games’ celebration plans. Since the game’s launch in 2016, the developer has continued to build the game through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450919/hello-games-no-mans-sky-next-game-sean-murray-interview"&gt;massive content updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts beta will launch in the United States in March </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9R6RIx-FXSd3HiCpZRUxJZNoiAg=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829754/shorts_youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7CncZ"&gt;YouTube is gearing up to launch a beta version of its TikTok competitor, Shorts, in the United States beginning in March, chief product officer Neal Mohan announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k379Nl"&gt;In a blog post announcing a number of features coming to YouTube in the coming months, Mohan said the YouTube team will be giving more creators access to Shorts in the United States. The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India, where the feature has existed for several months, according to Mohan. Since December, “the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled, and the YouTube Shorts player is now receiving more than 3.5 billion daily views globally,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLEDA"&gt;Reports that YouTube was working on a TikTok competitor first emerged in April 2020, but YouTube didn’t roll out Shorts in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;until September&lt;/a&gt;. While the company was trying to figure out how to extend its creator base and 2 billion monthly users to a mobile-first product in wake of TikTok’s explosive popularity, Instagram was doing the same thing. Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;launched Reels not long&lt;/a&gt; before YouTube rolled out Shorts, leading two of the world’s biggest tech and social platforms racing to catch up to ByteDance’s app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlrmjW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMjKEk"&gt;It’s no surprise that YouTube is trying to get Shorts into the hands of creators and users as quickly as possible. By November 2020, TikTok was seeing continuous spikes in growth, tripling the user base it had in 2018. Like other companies, TikTok’s business was helped by the pandemic, giving people stuck at home the ability to engage with a never-ending stream of new, short videos and make their own. TikTok is forecasted to cross the 1 billion monthly active user line &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/new-forecast-pegs-tiktok-to-top-1-2b-monthly-active-users-in-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHsY_7JfSNeqIDSlT2zjt_7imPDGSz5SVvIOvju6TxFRswkjZQGUQURJ7v9Ouiy89l7eG-p4ZMN_0G_m5ydXDQCp4ibK8Y2kTqAvnyPGi1BWAG4CVRjnYV96zC8Ypsr5VPMEYzi1nN9XMMOUns7dd4HkG80cP5gvhQwV8s9i42jO"&gt;this year, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro1eL5"&gt;All of this helps to explain why YouTube is finding new ways to give creators features that will keep them making videos for the platform (instead of pivoting entirely to TikTok or Reels). Mohan’s blog also announced new monetization features, including applause, which will allow &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365"&gt;fans to buy a one-time clapping animation&lt;/a&gt; that appears on top of the video. Creators are given a certain percentage of the revenue from each applause purchased. Similar tools like this already exist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14249630/youtube-super-chat-pay-pin-comments-live-stream"&gt;including Super Chat&lt;/a&gt;. Mohan didn’t say when the feature will become available to creators, only that people should be able to “unlock” it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcihDU"&gt;On top of that, YouTube is beta testing a “new integrated shopping experience” that will roll out later this year. The idea is that people can purchase items from channels whose opinions they trust. Creators can tag products in their videos allowing viewers to purchase them if they’d like, according to a YouTube spokesperson. As long as the product is within YouTube’s catalog, creators can tag them and viewers can purchase those products. Currently, those products are limited to beauty and electronic categories. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has asked YouTube for more information about the breakdown of revenue for creators if a product is bought from their channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dYHX9i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6_t26Q9aVM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIcKKJ"&gt;In an effort to give people more control over parts of YouTube and how they watch videos, the company is rolling out a couple of product features that will directly impact what and how they watch. On the YouTube Kids app, the product team will offer new parental tools that will allow parents to add specific videos and channels from the main app, according to the blog. This will allow children to watch videos that parents think are acceptable but may not appear in the YouTube Kids app because of restrictions in place — think certain types of gaming videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntpLGh"&gt;Finally, YouTube’s team is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238551/youtube-chapters-experiment-music-game-soundtracks-timestamp-video"&gt;expanding its “chapters” feature&lt;/a&gt;, which adds specific timestamps to videos. They’ll soon be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518034/google-search-ai-machine-learning-spelling-video-chapters-better-results"&gt;automatically added&lt;/a&gt; to relevant videos that may require chapters (like lo-fi chillhop channels). More detailed information about all of the changes can be read in Mohan’s blog, alongside the videos that YouTube’s product team will release throughout the year detailing what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYK8Q3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is adding offline downloads and 4K streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUF6Z24ux9IWeD5uXSDuh8SuNT4=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829749/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7n1Je"&gt;If the monthly price for all of these streaming TV services is going to keep going up, the least they can do is throw in some new features and better video quality, right? That’s what YouTube says you can soon expect from YouTube TV; today, the company announced that in the coming weeks, the service will “introduce a new add-on package with 4K streaming, offline viewing, and unlimited concurrent streams at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntVz5p"&gt;Unfortunately, a YouTube TV spokesperson didn’t have much else to share beyond the top-level news of these upcoming additions. It’s not clear whether there will be any limits on what channels or shows support offline downloads, nor is YouTube giving any examples of what content will be available in 4K. One would hope for some sporting events. Currently, customers have a maximum of three concurrent streams, but it seems like YouTube will be removing any such constraints so long as you’re viewing from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP6UyS"&gt;The “add-on package” language suggests you’ll have to pay more than the standard $65 monthly subscription to access these features. YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;raised its base subscription&lt;/a&gt; to that last June. But the company still advertises that, even as the cost increases, YouTube TV still doesn’t come with any hidden fees and offers unlimited cloud DVR space. The service has over 3 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon won’t build this Alexa cuckoo clock unless it hits a preorder goal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The first three gadgets in Amazon’s “Build It” program" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4ek-SgKcO1dGh4kLN8NDWGV-_8=/0x331:2369x1910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829743/Build_It_All_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first three gadgets in Amazon’s Build It program.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZGaQq"&gt;Amazon is launching a new consumer outreach program it’s calling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildIt?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Build It&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is a safer spin on a familiar crowdfunding idea: if enough people preorder something, Amazon will produce it. And if not, it won’t. The company is starting with three Alexa-powered gadgets: a cuckoo clock, a thermal sticky note printer, and a smart scale that can provide details on the food you’re weighing via a separate Echo device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLgWB"&gt;All three “concepts” are going up for preorder today as part of Amazon’s program for creating experimental hardware. It has already made some devices it doesn’t consider mainstream yet — like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; — under the Day 1 Editions branding. Built It is a subset, designed for gadgets that won’t even be released without proof of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh9Tpc"&gt;Where Kickstarter and Indiegogo offer the good vibes of supporting a startup (and the risk that goes along with that), Amazon’s take is simply to display a progress bar of preorders. Customers can cancel their preorder at any time or return the product should it end up being produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bipaqu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Frames review: listen to these specs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mbcOQ3"&gt;Amazon’s program is presumably designed to pick up the marketing benefits and hype that a product can get from a crowdfunding campaign. It may also be designed to seed the marketplace with more Alexa-powered gadget ideas. In any case, Amazon isn’t looking to “crowdfund” these gadgets, merely gauge customer interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTZtKn"&gt;When asked if Amazon planned to offer Built It campaigns to third-party companies in the future, a spokesperson wouldn’t comment. They also wouldn’t comment on what exactly the preorder goals would be. Rather than displaying a total dollar amount (as in crowdfunding) or even a total number of desired preorders, Build It campaigns will simply display a progress bar with a percentage next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon will only display a percentage of the preorder goal, not specific numbers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wTEOykoXocUGdb_8sn5IDIlWpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22308928/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_6.16.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon will only display a percentage of the preorder goal, not specific numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPBuV9"&gt;The three products Amazon is starting with all seem like fun gadgets that the company’s hardware division probably would have found a way to release even without the Build It program. All three feature different levels of Alexa integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBBcGw"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartStickyNotePrinter?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sticky note printer&lt;/a&gt; has a preorder price of $89.99. It can print out little reminders or puzzles based on voice commands to Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUY463"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartNutritionScale?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nutrition scale&lt;/a&gt; has the usual LED display and buttons, but you can also ask Alexa to answer questions about the food that’s set on it. Amazon’s example, “Alexa, ask Smart Scale how much sugar is in these blueberries,” gives you an idea of what you might be able to do. Its preorder price is $34.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0EMWL"&gt;Finally, the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartCuckooClock?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cuckoo clock&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/20/17883414/amazon-echo-wall-clock-led-timers-price-release-date"&gt;first Alexa-powered wall clock&lt;/a&gt;, but it does offer a bunch of customizations. There are 60 LED bulbs, the cuckoo bird itself, and a removable pendulum. Its preorder price is $79.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPSmVf"&gt;In all three cases, you’ll note that the prices here are “preorder” prices. Part of Amazon’s pitch for Build It gadgets is they’ll be less expensive for customers who preorder. Each preorder run will last 30 days, and customers won’t be charged until the product actually ships. Amazon says if these three gadgets meet their goal, it’s tentatively aiming to release them this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking through its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Maps" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOwIGxhancsnr1S5vYXVGscPq3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829742/DSCF2501__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVU5XP"&gt;Google Maps is adding a couple of new useful features: the ability to pay for parking or buy a train ticket right from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apqmkg"&gt;Google Maps is integrating two mobile parking payment services into its app, &lt;a href="https://www.passportparking.com/"&gt;Passport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkmobile.io/"&gt;ParkMobile&lt;/a&gt;. Both offer the ability to find, pay for, and replenish parking meters or parking lot fees through a smartphone app. Now, those features will also be available in Google Maps. According to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mHL2h7"&gt;Simply tap on the “Pay for Parking” button that appears as you near your destination. Then enter your meter number, the amount of time you want to park for, and tap “Pay.” Need to add more time to your meter? Easily extend your parking session with just a few taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VNaQuZ"&gt;The ability to pay for parking in Google Maps will be available in 400-plus cities in the US, including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and more, Google said. Android phone users will get the feature first, with iPhone owners soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gsCnar"&gt;&lt;q&gt;80 transit agencies around the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tK1TT8"&gt;Paying for public transportation will work much in the same way. If you are searching for transit directions in Google Maps, you’ll see an option to purchase tickets appear alongside your results. Similar to the pay for parking feature, customers will need to have a Google Pay account linked to a valid credit or debit card to make the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ppe8O7"&gt;Then, customers can use their phone — either in a tap-to-pay situation or by showing a digital ticket to a conductor — to ride public transportation. And in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, customers will be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. The feature will be available to use in over 80 transit systems around the world, Google says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hlx9Po"&gt;A number of transit agencies around the world have modernized their fare collection methods to include contactless or tap-to-pay mediums like Google Pay and Apple Pay. Some that rely on weekly or monthly passes, like London’s Oyster card or San Francisco’s Clipper card, have also started working with Apple and Google Pay to integrate those payment passes in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgBIvy"&gt;It’s the latest feature in Google Maps’ ongoing effort to make itself more user-friendly for commuters and transit riders. In 2019, it added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761187/google-maps-transit-crowded-delays-predictions-train-bus-subway"&gt;new transit crowdedness predictions&lt;/a&gt;, allowing customers to see how crowded their bus, train, or tube is likely to be before heading out on their commute. It also added a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20835131/google-maps-combine-transit-biking-ride-sharing"&gt;pairs transit directions with biking and ride-sharing options&lt;/a&gt; so customers can get directions using a variety of transportation modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52thSC"&gt;Google isn’t the only tech giant attempting to appeal to transit riders. Uber and Lyft have both recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205154/uber-public-transportation-app-denver"&gt;started integrating transit directions&lt;/a&gt; into their respective apps. Customers who live in Denver can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687461/uber-public-transportation-tickets-sold-denver"&gt;purchase train tickets&lt;/a&gt; using their Uber account. Both companies are building sophisticated algorithms that rely on reams of data from transit agencies pertaining to routes and schedules. Moreover, it’s a race among tech giants to become a one-stop shop for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVPCKg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos confirms March 9th product launch, hints at smaller portable speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIgRg5nUduOR7-D_twQNzeM0g_E=/0x7:1776x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829722/sonosedit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs1l6q"&gt;Sonos will announce its next new product on March 9th, the company confirmed today. The invite for the launch shows a person out in a field — strongly hinting that the device will be portable. My guess is it’s something that would fit in that shoulder bag. A recent Federal Communications Commission filing from Sonos revealed that it’s preparing to release what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;a smaller battery-powered speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Documents show the device to use Bluetooth and have a wireless charging stand much like the existing Sonos Move, which sells for $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeTy7n"&gt;Sonos is also developing a pair of premium noise-canceling headphones, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;made another appearance&lt;/a&gt; at the German Patent and Trademark Office. It looks like the design is almost final, and those would also fit the outdoor nature of this invite. But Sonos CEO Patrick Spence specified on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call that there’s only one new product coming in March. So it’s going to be one or the other. My money would be on the speaker being more likely, but we’ll see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niePE5"&gt;The most recent hardware releases from Sonos include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;Sonos Arc soundbar&lt;/a&gt; with Dolby Atmos, the Sonos Five (a revamped version of the Play:5 speaker), and a refreshed Sonos Sub. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas’ natural gas production just froze under pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winter Storm Uri Brings Ice And Snow Across Widespread Parts Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krJXMn8bIJuCEPc9kH-WKKeA1vg=/198x0:4602x2936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829697/1231205567.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pike Electric service trucks line up after a snowstorm on February 16th, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas. Winter storm Uri has brought historic cold weather and power outages to Texas as storms have swept across 26 states with a mix of freezing temperatures and precipitation.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ron Jenkins / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7RpdWU"&gt;Natural gas wells and pipes ill-equipped for cold weather are a big reason why millions of Texans lost power during frigid temperatures this week. As temperatures dropped to record lows across some parts of the state, liquid inside wells, pipes, and valves froze solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jHuVH"&gt;Ice can block gas flow, clogging pipes. It’s a phenomenon called a “freeze-off” that disrupts gas production across the US every winter. But freeze-offs can have outsized effects in Texas, as we’ve seen this week. The state is a huge natural gas producer — and it doesn’t usually have to deal with such cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ph2i6P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Texas relies on natural gas more than any other fuel for its electricity generation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnXfC"&gt;“When we think about what’s been going on in the last week and why it’s turned the market completely on its head is the fact that the freeze offs are occurring in Texas,” says Erika Coombs, director of oil &amp;amp; gas products at research firm BTU Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrdn4X"&gt;Texas relies on natural gas more than any other fuel for its electricity generation. Gas generated nearly half of the state’s electricity in 2019, &lt;a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2020/august/ercot.php"&gt;according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas&lt;/a&gt; (ERCOT). Wind and coal each accounted for about 20 percent of electricity generation that year, while nuclear made up about another 10 percent. While nuclear and wind power have been hampered by the storm, &lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/news/releases/show/225210"&gt;neither frigid nuclear plants nor frozen wind turbines&lt;/a&gt; bear the largest share of responsibility for Texas’ power problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLcaL0"&gt;“It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system,” Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at ERCOT, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a call with reporters on February 16th, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Texas Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiJScu"&gt;While the frigid cold slashed fuel supplies of all sorts, it also drove up demand for natural gas to heat homes. That “mismatch” is what’s driving these blackouts, says Coombs. There simply hasn’t been enough fuel on hand to power the state’s electricity needs. Natural gas production was pretty much halved in Texas and its gas-rich Permian Basin during the recent cold and stormy weather. It fell from 22.5 billion cubic feet of gas produced per day in December to between 10 to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day this week, according to estimates from BTU Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys1U9y"&gt;That drop-off in production is thanks to freeze-offs at wellheads where oil and gas are pumped out of the ground. But the cold has also stopped equipment from working properly at gas processing plants, Coombs says. Processing plants separate gas from fluid and impurities; when equipment freezes, plants have to heat it up or wait for temperatures to rise before they can resume their work. &lt;/p&gt;

Right now more than 4 million Texas homes are without power - these pictures help explain why. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KHOU11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KHOU11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Htownrush?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Htownrush&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/winterstorm2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#winterstorm2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/houston?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#houston&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZpqsSUzIN9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZpqsSUzIN9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lauren Talarico (@KHOULauren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KHOULauren/status/1361677146595459073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yw5XcV"&gt;While other states invest more in equipment that helps prevent freeze-offs, Texas hasn’t seen the need. North Dakota typically sees 20 days a year with freeze-off events, while the Permian Basin would normally have just four days a year with freeze-offs disrupting gas production, according to BTU Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA11sx"&gt;“With gas prices being low – and storage being full – the risk of 2-3 days of possible freeze-off every several years is a risk that Gulf Coast producers have been willing to take,” a &lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/content/committees/other/lts/keydocs/2013/BV_ERCOT_Gas_Study_Appendix_A.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on freeze-offs prepared for ERCOT in 2013 says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="YTQlsU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A risk that Gulf Coast producers have been willing to take”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCinFG"&gt;The last time Texas experienced anything close to the energy crisis it’s experiencing this week was probably &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=230"&gt;in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, when freezing temperatures lowered monthly gas supplies by about &lt;a href="https://btuanalytics.com/natural-gas-pricing/permian-freeze-offs-ahead/"&gt;10 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That year, the US Energy Information Administration &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=3390"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that energy disruptions from gas well freeze-offs rivaled interruptions from hurricanes and tropical storms. Since then, average daily gas production in the Permian Basin has more than tripled. That’s another reason why freeze-offs are a bigger problem in Texas now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jjCPW"&gt;They aren’t the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; problem when it comes to energy in Texas. The power outages &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;have also stopped natural gas pumping facilities&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, over the past few days, just about everything that could go wrong &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/in-texas-s-black-swan-blackout-everything-went-wrong-at-once"&gt;has failed spectacularly&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-grid-again-faces-scrutiny-over-cold-15955392.php"&gt;finger-pointing is only getting started&lt;/a&gt;. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for an investigation into why blackouts were so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAtdyL"&gt;“This was a total failure by ERCOT,” Abbott told &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-ercot/"&gt;KTRK Houston&lt;/a&gt;. “ERCOT stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and they showed that they were not reliable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn0P7d"&gt;Meanwhile, millions of people in Texas remain without power as a &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2021/02/15/one-down-one-to-go-another-winter-storm-could-dump-5-more-inches-of-snow-on-dallas-fort-worth/"&gt;second winter storm sweeps through the state&lt;/a&gt;. As of Tuesday night, there was &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2021/02/16/ercot-says-they-have-no-idea-when-texas-power-outages-will-end/"&gt;still no indication of when the outages would end&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s voice DMs arrive in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SFT36Pz6w_boU1F8wUyBDwFFkQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829596/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OWPiaY"&gt;Twitter has rolled out support for voice direct messages on iOS and Android in India starting today, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/twitter-begins-testing-voice-dms-india-brazil-japan?utm_source=ac_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=99269&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the audio messages are now available in three countries worldwide: India, Brazil, and Japan. Plans for voice DMs were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452932/twitter-voice-audio-direct-messages-test-brazil"&gt;first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter says the feature, which it’s calling an “experiment,” will roll out in India in phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGMx9D"&gt;In a statement, Twitter India’s managing director, Manish Maheshwari, said voice messages are designed to “give people a new way to express themselves and help them connect through the nuances, emotion, and empathy built by hearing someone’s voice.” Similar features are already available on other services like Messenger, Instagram DMs, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YZhasD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; test, test: Starting today, you'll be able to record and send voice messages in DMs   Here’s how &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. The experiment will be rolled out in phases. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aqQM6h9sof"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aqQM6h9sof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter India (@TwitterIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfNzR6"&gt;A video released by Twitter India shows how the feature works. Users can start recording using a small icon to the right of the message box, and voice messages can be up to 140 seconds in length. There’s an option to review a voice message before sending it. Although it isn’t possible to send voice messages from the web at the moment, browsers can reportedly still play back the audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94O2Wy"&gt;While Twitter has traditionally been a text-based platform, it’s tested a number of audio-centric features over the last year, including audio tweets the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;testing on iOS&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, which are voice chat rooms similar to what Clubhouse offers. However, Twitter’s audio ambitions faced criticism for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;lack of accessibility options&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company announced it was setting up &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible.html"&gt;new accessibility teams&lt;/a&gt; within the company and that it would be adding automated captions to audio and video on the platform in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcIBJW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super73 is the latest e-bike company to land a huge investment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cr1eNFDk1vKzA3b4LOk1PmTBUos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829465/sokane_1842_super_73_scout_9173.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oRi4cs"&gt;Super73, the Southern California e-bike company popular among YouTubers and film celebrities, announced that it has raised an impressive $20 million from investors, making it the latest company to benefit from growing venture capital interest after a record year of e-bike sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23vEYt"&gt;The funding round is Super73’s first and was led by equity firm Volition Capital, which was an early investor in Chewy before its acquisition by PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017. With these new funds, the direct-to-consumer e-bike company plans on growing its 75-person staff, improving its customer service operation, and expanding its product lineup, said Super73 co-founder and CEO LeGrand Crewse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dtnRhU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Super73 helped popularize a retro, mini-bike style of e-bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMahh1"&gt;“It was never about bikes, it was never about transportation, it was really about building a lifestyle, a true lifestyle brand,” Crewse said, “and one that stood for the values that we had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kcoa"&gt;Founders love to extoll the virtues of their “community” of loyal customers, and Crewse is no different. “We have this incredible community of people that [see] Super 73 and our products [as] much much more than, you’re getting from point A to point B, or we’re getting out of a car or anything else,” he said. “It’s about getting together with other people and forming these new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5KVVl"&gt;With their long banana seats, parallelogram-shaped frames, upright handlebars, fat tires, and oversized headlights, Super73 helped popularize a style of e-bike that was influenced by the mini-bikes or mopeds of the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s. The company’s relaxed, SoCal vibe has helped it earn a following from a growing cadre of A-list celebrities, musicians, and influencers, whose social media posts featuring the bikes are typically as good, if not better, than any paid advertisement. (Please watch Jack Black’s Thor-inspired adventures on his Super73 bike that’s embedded below. It’s so good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MQQrEf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J02iZ3FvRoc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJ45WN"&gt;Crewse said he is proud of the fact that Super73 has never had to pay for any of these celebrity endorsements. The company has always aspired to be more than just an e-bike business, he said. “It was never about bikes, it was never about transportation,” he said. “It was really about building a true lifestyle brand, one that stood for the values that we had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iJNVW"&gt;But since Super73 emerged several years ago, mini-bikes have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20875870/juiced-scorpion-ebike-price-specs-release"&gt;exploded in popularity&lt;/a&gt;, with retro-influenced models found all over Instagram and other social media platforms. But as the market becomes flooded with similar-looking designs, Super73 is trying to stay focused on making sure its e-bikes are always the best, Crewse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsPTcw"&gt;“There’s going to be a race to the bottom, there’s going to be a commoditization that’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that there’s big players out there that are racing towards that. But we’re taking a very different path.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOy9hP"&gt;That different path appears to lead to faster, more powerful e-bikes like the R-series models unveiled in early 2020. More inspired by dirt bikes than Super73’s previous models, the R-series bikes have front and rear suspension, peak 2,000-watt motors, 960Wh batteries, and a top speed of 28 mph. They’re also not cheap, retailing for around $3,250, and not lightweight, tipping the scales at 80lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezyOeN"&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, are experiencing a boom in popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;over the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to the pandemic lockdowns. A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62-percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144-percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VOBJgy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, are experiencing a boom in popularity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVmxI9"&gt;Consulting firm Deloitte &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;estimated in a report last year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of e-bikes in circulation worldwide should reach 300 million by 2023 — a 50-percent increase over 2019’s 200 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdt7DS"&gt;Investors see a clear opportunity in continuing to fuel that growth. Rad Power Bikes closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rad-power-bikes-closes-25-million-in-funding-to-grow-direct-to-consumer-electric-bike-business-300999573.html"&gt;$25 million deal&lt;/a&gt; last February, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;secured a whopping $150 million&lt;/a&gt; investment just a week ago. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;Dutch e-bike brand VanMoof landed $40 million&lt;/a&gt; in September. In total, European VCs poured $165 million into e-bikes in 2019 and 2020, more than the previous four years combined, according to data from PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWE0LL"&gt;With its investment money in the bank, Super73 plans on rolling out new products in the near future, and while Crewse wouldn’t say specifically what the company is working on, he promised it would expand beyond the company’s current lineup of mini-bike and scrambler-inspired models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rkc0Ns"&gt;“If it’s on two wheels, you know we’re certainly looking at it,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
