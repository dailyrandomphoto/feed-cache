    <title>Senate approves billions for US semiconductor manufacturing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Speaker Pelosi Holds Bill Enrollment Ceremony For Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCdxG3iBjDA2cqIu1VyofFyT3aA=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425295/1232985295.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="spHDan"&gt;After months of political jockeying and procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a massive science and technology bill Tuesday to boost US competitiveness with China. The bill invests billions into emerging technology industries like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum computing in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrtDCD"&gt;The bill — titled the US Innovation and Competition Act or USICA — builds off a previous proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-senator-young-and-representatives-khanna-and-gallagher-introduce-endless-frontier-act-with-12-bipartisan-senators-and-5-representatives-to-dramatically-increase-us-investment-and-leadership-in-science-and-tech-innovation-strengthen-economic-and-national-security-and-keep-the-us-strategically-competitive-with-china-and-other-countries"&gt;Endless Frontier Act&lt;/a&gt;. Endless Frontier was lauded as one of the first big bipartisan bills to come from the Biden administration. But over the last few months, the bill, which was seen as a must-pass piece of legislation for both parties, was bloated with political mush and much of the original funding was watered down as it moved through the Senate process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOIEFp"&gt;In its current form, the bill provides $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as a 30 percent boost in funding for the National Science Foundation and $29 billion for a new science directorate to focus on applied sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kGClzp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the future will be the global economic leader”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAugSi"&gt;“Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the future will be the global economic leader,” Schumer said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1402304321815986178?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. “We must invest in science, R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3C7Ht"&gt;The Endless Frontier Act was originally intended to provide $100 billion in funding for a new science directorate at the National Science Foundation to promote research in emerging tech fields. It would dole out billions to regions all across the country to build out new tech hubs and encourage tech companies to find homes outside of Silicon Valley and the coasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjVjDu"&gt;Last month, the package appeared to be doomed as Republicans withheld their votes to end debate on the bill. Hours after the initial cloture vote was called, Schumer reached an agreement with Republicans to hold votes on parts of the bill they were contesting the following week. Specifically, Republicans were concerned with language in the bill that would require a prevailing wage for semiconductor manufacturers in the US. On Tuesday, an amendment to strike that language was shot down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7Qo8L"&gt;In March, President Joe Biden put out his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;sweeping infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; known as the American Jobs Plan. The original $2 trillion plan contained funding for broadband expansion, roads, highways, and called for $50 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Tuesday’s vote in the Senate marks the next step in achieving parts of the administration’s infrastructure goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDKshs"&gt;Earlier this year, Biden signed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to combat growing concerns over a global semiconductor shortage. The order called for a 100-day government review of supply chains to address shortfalls in acquiring chips. That review was published Tuesday, and the White House &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-launches-task-force-address-supply-chain-disruptions-n1269925"&gt;launched a new task force&lt;/a&gt; to address these supply chain disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QrIOQ"&gt;Tuesday’s USICA approval also provides $10 billion to reshape cities and regions across the US into “technology hubs,” focusing on research and development into cutting-edge industries and creating new, well-paying tech jobs outside of the coasts. The funds will go to the Commerce Department and cities will be able to pitch the government on why it should be on the receiving end of these funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ukXkC"&gt;“This is certainly a welcome injection of resources,” Mike Wallace, legislative director for human development at the National League of Cities, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. “These are funds that will help local officials, but all stakeholders, think about economic mobility in a regional way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGbjW9"&gt;USICA faced criticism not only from Republicans, but from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Sanders initially voted to tank the competition bill last month over what he called a “multi-billion dollar Bezos Bailout” that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;authorize $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; for the Amazon CEO’s space venture, Blue Origin, to participate in NASA’s next Moon mission, codenamed “Project Artemis.” Sanders also attempted to negotiate language in the bill that would give the federal government equity interest in exchange for semiconductor grants and aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0udme"&gt;The package still needs to move through the House before President Biden can sign it into law. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBordelon/status/1402339116423991300?s=20"&gt;Schumer said&lt;/a&gt; that he was “quite certain that we will get a really good product on the president’s desk,” but it’s unclear how long that will take or if the bill will change further.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brought back the beloved magnifying glass for selecting text in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJNnS9HAWzSLl1uJNOW2sgwHw_s=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424709/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it used to look like, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs"&gt;a great demonstration here&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s at least better than the nothing that appears in iOS 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaRxtd8kO_pa_upcMuglfrFOUiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645890/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_12.51.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The feature listing on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Did we not want to select exactly the text we wanted before?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88e77i"&gt;It will, at the very least, solve the biggest problem with the current selection system: that your thumb is covering the text you’re trying to select, which makes it &lt;em&gt;a little difficult&lt;/em&gt; to see what’s being selected until you pick your thumb up from the screen. Then, if you’re like me, you’ll probably sigh seeing that the wrong thing is selected, then struggle with the text selection handles to try to highlight what you were actually going for (squinting at the small screen the whole time).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqoiEOLf3_erOksYOeME5AXIfyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645992/ios_14_selection_woes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It isn’t always this bad, but iOS 14’s text selection leaves something to be desired (and that something is a magnifier).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6t59P"&gt;iOS 15 is currently in early beta, so anything we see now is subject to change — Apple could always make the magnifying glass more prominent based on feedback, if it seems like a lot of people are still struggling. While this feature isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for me to risk downloading the first developer beta, I think it may be what gets me to immediately grab the first public beta when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IRS wants more authority to collect data on cryptocurrencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBMmT9cG0I4lBQlMfnJiGHgqQaU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424688/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7BKDMN"&gt;The Internal Revenue Service asked Congress for more authority to request reporting on the transactions of cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/irs-chief-asks-congress-for-authority-to-get-cryptocurrency-data?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The IRS hopes to use the data it collects to develop regulations for the fast-growing crypto industry — if it’s able to get the space’s biggest players to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRkMp4"&gt;The organization made the request during the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-irss-fiscal-year-2022-budget"&gt;IRS’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget&lt;/a&gt;. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said that the group is challenged frequently in its requests for reporting and “to have a clear dictate from Congress on the authority of [it] to collect that information is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqUC8D"&gt;A request from the IRS for actual power to do something about cryptocurrencies makes sense. Proposed legislation regulating the industry has been piling up, especially since Biden took office. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;In December&lt;/a&gt;, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed requiring exchanges to report information (like names, for instance) connected to private anonymous crypto wallets exchanging over $10,000 in a day. It also proposed similar “know-your-customer” requirements &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-proposes-kyc-rules-for-crypto-wallets"&gt;on international transactions&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the government seems to be to make exchanges work more like banks and cryptocurrencies themselves more like cash, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2021/05/31/irs-crypto-tax-risks-expand-with-new-reporting/?sh=c0dfbe97a658"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, with the taxes both would imply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnPlS9"&gt;The most recent case for that conceptual and legal reframing was a request from the US Treasury Department on May 20th. The Treasury (of which the IRS is technically a part) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446364/treasury-cryptocurrency-irs-fraud-tax-evasion"&gt;formally requested&lt;/a&gt; all exchanges to share information on transactions over $10,000. The report the department published at the time claimed that “cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion.” Collecting data on those transactions could hopefully make that practice less enticing and the IRS’s request makes it clear it’ll need help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P1Ulr"&gt;However Congress and the IRS choose to move forward, the request is yet another example of the growing effort to take the wild out of the cryptocurrency industry’s Wild West. With the popularity of crypto, there’s bound to be more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmUOSo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US wants to fix its broken lithium battery supply chain  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ECONOMY-lithium-battery" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlamuhqlRlrgmPpVbKHElq8rWTA=/5x0:5261x3504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424505/1231679704.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This photo taken on March 12, 2021 shows workers at a factory for Xinwangda Electric Vehicle Battery Co. Ltd, which makes lithium batteries for electric cars and other uses, in Nanjing in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldMZxw"&gt;The US announced plans to build out a domestic supply chain for lithium batteries, which are critical for electric vehicles and renewable energy. Its new goal is to be able to do nearly everything — from mining to manufacturing and recycling batteries — within its borders by the end of the decade. If it fails, the US could struggle to meet its own&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;climate goals and compete in the growing electric vehicle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N5wxn"&gt;The Department of Energy (DOE) released a “&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/national-blueprint-lithium-batteries"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” today outlining how it plans to boost America’s ability to make lithium batteries. Demand for these&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries has already skyrocketed for electronics and electric vehicles. Spruced-up electricity grids will also need large&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries to accommodate increasing amounts of solar and wind power. In its blueprint, the DOE even makes a case for battery-powered planes to take to the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iZatIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our supply chains for the transportation, utility, and aviation sectors will be vulnerable and beholden to others for key technologies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zgOpJO"&gt;Right now, the US is a small player in the global battery industry. China dominates both battery manufacturing and mineral supply chains. On its current trajectory, the US is expected to be able to supply less than half the projected demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles on its roads by 2028. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffi3X0"&gt;“These projections show there is a real threat that U.S. companies will not be able to benefit from domestic and global market growth,” the blueprint says. “Our supply chains for the transportation, utility, and aviation sectors will be vulnerable and beholden to others for key technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vVrZ6"&gt;A lot of what’s holding the US back, according to the DOE, is a lack of a national strategy. So to turn things around, the DOE laid out its priorities for federal investment in the technology this decade. One of the biggest problems to tackle is how to nab enough key minerals. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;looming shortage&lt;/a&gt; of lithium, cobalt, and nickel used in batteries. To make things worse, these things are only mined in a few places, and labor and human rights abuses are common. That makes finding new mineral&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sources and designing batteries that use less of these materials pretty urgent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX64Cx"&gt;There’s already a race to tap lithium deposits in the US, and the DOE’s new blueprint will likely accelerate domestic mining efforts. The DOE also called for mandating recycling so that battery makers can eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;harvest more materials&lt;/a&gt; from old products. Longer term, the DOE actually wants to find a way to make lithium-ion batteries without cobalt and nickel by 2030. (Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451670/tesla-cobalt-free-cathodes-mining-battery-nickel-ev-cost"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year that it would make EV battery cathodes without cobalt). Through better design, it ultimately wants to cut the cost of an EV battery pack in half by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtHCh8"&gt;The DOE plans to distribute $17 billion in loans for EV manufacturing facilities in the US. It’s also looking to deploy more large-scale energy storage at federal sites. And it released new guidelines requiring&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;federal contractors and grantees to manufacture the products they’re researching and developing, including anything related to advanced batteries, in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lFfaDv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US will probably need to figure out how to make a lot more stuff on its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MeHAdD"&gt;It’s part of a broader push by the Biden administration to develop more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;domestic supply chains. In addition to lithium-ion batteries, they are also focused on critical minerals, semiconductor chips, and pharmaceuticals. The administration published a larger &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of all those supply chains today and announced a new task force to stop supply chain disruptions. That task force is focused on finding short-term solutions after the COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177024/apple-just-in-time-manufacturing-china-coronavirus-supply-chain"&gt;revealed big weaknesses&lt;/a&gt; in global supply chains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kkCNj"&gt;In the long term, the US will probably need to figure out how to make a lot more stuff on its own. The Biden administration will put aside $100 million in grants for state-level apprenticeship programs that will help create workforces for new domestic supply chains. “Decades of focusing on labor as a cost to be managed and not an asset to be invested in have weakened our domestic supply chains,” deputy director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili said in a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; today. “It’s clear from these reports that we need to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="233cKD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV just got a much cheaper streaming option for its live TV guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DfCvcGR7sr5iWqQ3cV2TsJampI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424266/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VLqEeX"&gt;Google TV, which offers one of the cleanest streaming experiences to cord-cutters, just vastly improved its live TV options — which is to say, users actually have options now. While the “Live” tab was previously limited to Google’s own pricey live TV streaming service, YouTube TV, the company has introduced a cheaper alternative with a Sling TV integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huFQBb"&gt;The companies confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the added support for Sling TV marks the first non-Google live TV integration for the platform, and that’s significant. While quite good, YouTube TV costs $65 per month before any additional add-ons or entertainment subscriptions like Starz or HBO Max offered through the service. Sling TV, meanwhile, starts at $35 per month for either of its two base plans: Orange for sports and family content or Blue for news and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sling TV integration on Google TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TuxxgF"&gt;Now, that’s not to say that Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, or Fubo TV users couldn’t access their live TV services on the platform — you absolutely can by simply navigating to your designated live and linear app. But Google has a special Live tab up on the top that makes navigation a breeze, and this tab was previously only available to subscribers of its YouTube TV service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ka6CV"&gt;Now, however, anyone who wants their live TV baked directly into their Google TV experience has another, more affordable option. While Sling TV’s plans offer around half the channels that YouTube TV does — around 30 to 45 versus YouTube TV’s more than 85 channels — the service also offers &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dirt cheap package add-ons&lt;/a&gt; starting around $6 for decent customization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nsNPN"&gt;Google TV is currently available on Sony’s 2021 Bravia XR TVs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast device&lt;/a&gt;, with the platform soon to launch on TCL TVs. To enable the feature within the Google TV experience, link your Sling TV plan to your Google account in the Google Home app. After Sling TV’s been linked through Google Home, a Live tab should appear up top in the Google TV navigation bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFpQIQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 8th, 4:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; After publication, a spokesperson for Sling TV told &lt;/em&gt;The Verge &lt;em&gt;that the update will be rolling out to compatible devices throughout the next week. The spokesperson added that the integration should be widely available “within the next several days.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s password-protected photos feature is arriving on newer Pixels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_OQdAJrUv8JP5_VqGCtpZ-MpU20=/0x107:2342x1668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424198/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_11.25.31_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put in the Locked Folder for puppy crimes (being too cute).&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jhmjoj"&gt;Google’s Locked Folder feature, which allows you to password-protect specific images or videos to keep them from showing up in your main photo library, is available in the latest Pixel update, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/07/june-pixel-feature-drop-2021/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388"&gt;Google’s page explaining Locked Folder&lt;/a&gt; says the feature is only currently available on Pixel devices, starting with the 3. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;announced the feature at its I/O conference&lt;/a&gt;, Google said that it would be coming to other Android phones “throughout the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eA6snZ"&gt;If you’ve got an updated Pixel, you can set up the Locked Folder by going to Photos, then to Library &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Locked Folder. Once it is set up, this is where you’ll be able to see your secret stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXibZf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is some amount of trade-off between privacy and convenience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQMU4H"&gt;You’re able to move existing photos to the Locked Folder, which will remove them both from your regular library and from any existing Memories that the picture may appear in. It’s worth noting that, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;, you can’t back up any photos or videos in the Locked Folder, so there is some amount of trade-off between privacy and convenience. Anything in the Locked Folder can, however, be moved out of it if you no longer need to keep it private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CyKpD"&gt;Google’s support page also explains that you can even set the camera to save captured images directly to the Locked Folder, keeping them from ever going into your normal library. This could be useful if, for example, you were at a protest and wanted to make sure any pictures you took weren’t available to anyone else who might get hold of your phone. Or, for a more obvious example, if you were taking some spicy selfies you wanted to keep private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6EZOK"&gt;Locked Folder is included as part of &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/feature-drop-starry-videos-pride-wallpapers"&gt;the June Pixel update&lt;/a&gt;, which is rolling out to phones now. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/07/june-pixel-feature-drop-2021/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update also includes the ability to ask Google Assistant to answer or reject a call, take astrophotography videos (on the Pixel 4 and newer), and an improvement to Gboard that places key details (like a phone number) in your keyboard’s suggestion strip after you’ve copied the text to your clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-year-old iPhone 6S will get iOS 15, and that rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBUoFOzgTMz04ihhp5021RnhETM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424126/iphone_6s_plus_clean_2_7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus arrived in September 2015 running iOS 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ydGZS"&gt;The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you’ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you — your phone will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUWzSX"&gt;Six years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn’t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security support&lt;/a&gt; for some of its phones. But six years of OS updates and security support puts the 6S in an entirely different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuOLa"&gt;To be sure, there are a lot of new features that won’t work with the 6S’s A9 Bionic processor. Features like the Google Lens-esque Visual Lookup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; in photos, portrait mode in FaceTime, and immersive walking directions in Maps won’t be available to 6S users, since they all require a device with an A12 Bionic chip a la the XS and XR or later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vw84SQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6J0gyt"&gt;It’s also possible that newer software will slow down an older phone with an aging, less nimble processor. That might not necessarily be the case, though — both &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-14-on-the-iphone-6s-and-se-performance-is-fine-other-stuff-is-not/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ios14-older-iphones-3795531/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant impact on performance running iOS 14 on the 6S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS5T8p"&gt;What may be a bigger issue, as both testers noted, is that the 6S shows its age with poor battery life. Features like widgets are also tougher to use on the phone’s 4.7-inch screen, which is quaint compared to today’s standard six-inch-plus panels. These aren’t so much compatibility issues as the inevitable, slow march of time that no gadget can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMJ1dL"&gt;iPhone 6S owners shouldn’t despair, though. They’ll still get potentially useful updates like notification summaries and Focus modes to minimize interruptions throughout the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;video and music sharing&lt;/a&gt; in FaceTime, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;added privacy features&lt;/a&gt; like a seven-day app privacy report to keep tabs on how apps are using your information. There’s also the peace of mind that comes with running the latest OS version, and the security patches and bug fixes that come with it throughout the year. Not a bad deal for a six-year-old device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Screen Time to keep your iPhone use within healthy limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9j9UYVViDxjCj-v3bXiMEjYOLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424084/bfarsace_201106_4269_026.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71fUVO"&gt;We all spend a lot of time on our phones, and it’s possible — just possible — that some of us spend too much time. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;we ran an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to use what was then Apple’s brand-new Screen Time feature, which was built in order to help people keep their on-screen time in some sort of sane proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g5Gbf"&gt;At the time (which was when iOS 12 came out), you could use Screen Time to check how much time you spent on your phone, use an App Limits feature to limit your (or your kids’) daily time spent on various apps or types of apps, or use its Downtime feature to cut off access to all (except a few) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odVZMI"&gt;Since then, and especially since iOS 13 came out, Screen Time has been expanded, making it easier to lock down apps and / or limit your screentime. (There have been no additional features announced so far for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll add them here if there are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRN1jS"&gt;To begin using Screen Time, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time.” Here are some of the things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2VTij"&gt;Daily Average&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pmiNMf"&gt;At the top of the Screen Time app, you can see an accounting of your activity over the course of the day. Click on “See All Activity” to see a breakdown of which specific apps you used and how long you used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggA_yQU7yRGAjbRvvMF5Oyct128=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645210/IMG_5AFD8368F3A3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PUC2UJiLMEeGJQvp2iQ6NVrKWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645212/IMG_B722454A795A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9a4phx"&gt;Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr76BG"&gt;Downtime lets you set periods when you want to force yourself to give your eyes a rest and avoid staring at the screen. It does this by locking down the apps with which you are most likely to spend time. These lockdowns are not absolute — as you’ll see later, you can cancel Downtime when you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztlSvG"&gt;Begin by choosing when you want to start your time away from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jGPz2g"&gt;Tap on “Downtime” and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ULynqq"&gt;Select the days (it can be every day or just on specific days) and times that you want to avoid getting swallowed by your favorite iPhone apps. During those times, only specified apps that you pre-selected (along with phone calls) will be allowed through. For example, you can disable Facebook and Twitter during working hours, but keep the Messages app going for texts. (We’ll go over how to choose which apps to disable in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6xpbLB"&gt;You’ll get a warning before Downtime kicks in. If you need to keep working on an app, don’t worry — you’ll be given the chance to ask for one more minute, to be reminded in another 15 minutes, or to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set Downtime for everyday or specific days, and for set times for each day" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdFBe_H4X6SF5P9swk0plrwrUus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645426/IMG_5D6CBD759B26_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set Downtime for every day or specific days, and for set times for each day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pADXaUsGVY4ryDYQtUOAo0mAl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645432/IMG_9FECEC603727_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbF9r"&gt;Keep in mind that Downtime, and the other Screen Time features, can be applied to all your devices that use iCloud. So if you set it on your iPhone, for example, it can apply to your Mac or iPad as well. To share your settings across your devices, go to the Screen Time main screen and toggle “Share Across Devices” on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrjeu"&gt;Now that you’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you want some downtime, you’ll probably want to select &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; apps should be allowed to remain active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dtarU"&gt;Back in the Screen Time main screen, select “Always Allowed.” Here you can choose which apps you will still have access to during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cuuooE"&gt;You’ll see two sets of apps: Allowed Apps and Choose Apps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifFL5P"&gt;To select an app you’ll always want access to, even during downtime, tap on the app’s name in Choose Apps and it will appear in the Allowed Apps list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w2QVxh"&gt;If you want to disallow any of the Allowed Apps, tap on the minus sign next to the app, and then on “Remove.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FqNQvs"&gt;There are more ways to personalize Downtime. Let’s say you want to get alerted about text messages from specific people — you’re planning to concentrate on a project and don’t want to hear from any of your friends, but you still want to get texts from family members. You can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SDiM1O"&gt;On the same “Always Allowed” page, tap on “Contacts” at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElBJnY"&gt;Under “Allowed Communication,” select “Specific Contacts” and choose which contacts you want to allow through, even during downtime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2NpCxn"&gt;Note that the “Allowed Communication” page is also accessible from the main Screen Time page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gpVsFE"&gt;App Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WJAgoC"&gt;Another way to keep your app use in check is to limit the amount of time you use an app (rather than setting what time of day you can use it). For example, if Twitter tends to be your personal black hole, you can decide not to spend more than, say, two hours on Twitter each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxdU0L"&gt;To set your app limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D2hPC7"&gt;In the Screen Time screen, select “App Limits” &amp;gt; “Add Limit.” Toggle “App Limits” on and tap on “Add Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4taRzN"&gt;You’ll see a list of categories, such as “Social,” “Games,” and “Entertainment.” Tap on a specific category, and it will open up to show a list of all your apps that are in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HVgNG7TqpIvA2ZJEajF91Ze8Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645260/IMG_0AC0E116FFC1_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can limit specific apps or a category of apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVuQKZnLTu1F-8KNNgr9lDJ8oSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645257/IMG_476F28DD6A3A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can limit specific apps or a category of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hSDXif"&gt;Select the apps that you want to limit — or select an entire category to choose all the apps in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dcKdTv"&gt;Tap on “Next” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L3Mu3i"&gt;Select the maximum amount of time you can use the app(s) on a daily basis. When you reach your limit, you’ll be interrupted by a screen that lets you either apply the limit (just tap on the “OK” button), or shrug and select “Ignore Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ymh75o"&gt;If you choose the latter, you can get one more minute, ask to be reminded in 15 minutes, or decide to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how much time you want to spend on an app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKfJy4XokyLHBVGjX8EnbofR02c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645275/IMG_63420372C935_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how much time you want to spend on an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time, or ignore it altogether." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-qXntlLlTVEGUdOsPRZCtrWWpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645285/IMG_7424C1B86747_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time or ignore it altogether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r6JZtS"&gt;Note: if for any reason you don’t want to use an app at all, except for on rare occasions, you can set the Screen Time to 23 hours and 59 minutes. The app will then be out of reach unless you go back into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time” &amp;gt; “App Limits” and disable the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dvoc84"&gt;Screen Time Passcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tDNcaj"&gt;If you want to keep certain apps out of the reach of your kids — or your roommate — then you can create a passcode that will be needed to make any changes to Screen Time. The passcode is also useful if you feel you need an extra barrier before you undo one of your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1NcJMg"&gt;Go to Screen Time and tap on “Use Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FS0GOB"&gt;Set a four-digit passcode, and then reenter it when asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsAy9X"&gt;Enter your Apple ID and password so that you can use it if you’ve forgotten your passcode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uVVIrR"&gt;And that’s it. If you want to change or delete your passcode, go back to Screen Time and select “Change Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LN0t9l"&gt;Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="carjbn"&gt;The last selection in Screen Time isn’t as much concerned with when you use your iPhone as with what you see or hear on it. Select “Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions” if you want to allow or restrict explicit content, keep TV shows or movies to certain ratings, set an age limit for apps, limit which websites are allowed, and set a number of different limits on games (such as multiplayer games, connecting with friends, or private messaging). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql5dhD"&gt;Most of this is geared toward parents who want to oversee what their kids see and hear online, but if you’d rather avoid accidentally crashing into any “adult” websites, it could be useful. There are also a number of privacy features, such as stopping Apple advertising, or not allowing apps to change the settings of your microphone, Bluetooth sharing, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is getting back into physical retail — sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOiLy6nmMlxa6cEzDmR1u3jAOZo=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423450/twarren_190709_3533_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IyGoax"&gt;Microsoft is returning to selling products at brick-and-mortar stores, kind of. The software giant will start selling products at its “Experience Centers” in London, New York City, and Sydney next month. Select Microsoft products will be available on July 1st, but the global chip shortage will impact what’s available to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsDSdJ"&gt;Xbox Series X / S consoles won’t be available initially, until stocks of these devices improve to meet demand. Other Xbox-related products will be available, alongside Surface devices and Microsoft 365 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hTlM8"&gt;“Our Microsoft Experience Centers were created to provide customers a way to experience our products in person,” said Travis Walter, Microsoft’s head of retail stores, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We use these spaces to test and experiment, and continue to evolve the experience based on customer feedback. Starting July 1st, customers will be able to purchase select Microsoft products at the New York, London and Sydney locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MX7MQeSRf-EI8JGKazsE3Fr7_3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18298271/twarren_190709_3533_0021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Experience Center in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xYniNS"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open"&gt;permanently closed its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; in the US and around the world last year, shortly after the pandemic began. The company has been moving store employees to areas that help sell to, train, and support Microsoft’s business customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9wyqu"&gt;This move doesn’t signal a return of Microsoft’s retail stores, and there won’t be online ordering or pick up in store available. Microsoft has been using its four Experience Center locations to host business customers, and the ability to purchase items is primarily aimed at those who visit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI secretly launched an encrypted messaging system for criminals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NETHERLANDS-EU-POLICE-CRIME" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjL0GxXmzYAJTp8lg_9KzZRkhxI=/483x0:4205x2481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423325/1233329640.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uKFDmm"&gt;An encrypted phone service called Anom was secretly run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a yearslong international sting operation. Law enforcement agencies across Europe, the US, and Oceania revealed Anom’s origins earlier today, saying they had &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/800-criminals-arrested-in-biggest-ever-law-enforcement-operation-against-encrypted-communication"&gt;arrested 800 criminal suspects&lt;/a&gt; based on intercepted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoJMeB"&gt;According to public statements, the FBI and other agencies seeded secure Anom phones with suspected crime syndicates, gradually building a network of around 12,000 total (and 9,000 active) devices. The phones secretly siphoned 27 million messages between 2019 and 2021, resulting in Operation Greenlight / Trojan Shield — a large-scale bust that included seizing around eight tons of cocaine, 22 tons of cannabis and cannabis resin, 250 firearms, and $48 million in traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0QPp0e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anom filled a void left by other encrypted service shutdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DGy2Cr"&gt;Seamus Hughes, a George Washington University researcher, offered more details from &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20799201-operation-trojan-shield-court-record"&gt;court records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shield-anom-fbi-secret-phone-network"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; based on Hughes’ work, Anom started in 2018 after police shut down Phantom Secure, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa73dz/fbi-tried-to-plant-backdoor-in-encrypted-phone-phantom-secure"&gt;an encrypted device network&lt;/a&gt; used mostly (the FBI alleges exclusively) by drug traffickers and other organized criminals. An unnamed informant, who had previously sold Phantom Secure phones, told the FBI they were building a “next generation” encrypted device called Anom. The informant offered the system to the FBI and Australian Federal Police in exchange for a reduced sentence on criminal charges, then agreed to sell Anom phones to their existing distribution network that catered to organized crime, giving the new system credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blTkav"&gt;Unbeknownst to buyers, each Anom message included a “master key” that would let law enforcement decrypt its contents, and each device tied a fixed ID number to any username the owner chose. The messages secretly routed to servers that the FBI — as well as the AFP and later other police agencies — could access. A court filing cites examples of these messages, including photos of cocaine packages and conversations about how to smuggle shipments of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqgQ7h"&gt;Most early Anom users were located in Australia. But the network ultimately covered 90 countries, with Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, and Serbia seeing the most users. Its growth surged in early 2021, when law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88aybp/sky-secure-shuts-down-blackberry"&gt;shut down Sky Global&lt;/a&gt;, another encrypted messaging company. A press release from Europol says that 300 criminal syndicates used Anom devices, including “Italian organized crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs, and international drug trafficking organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YM5WUC"&gt;Beyond direct busts made with Anom data, the FBI described Anom as a move to “shake the  confidence in this entire industry” of encrypted device services. Police have tried to plant backdoors in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-time-tim-cook-stood-his-ground-against-fbi/"&gt;both general-purpose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa73dz/fbi-tried-to-plant-backdoor-in-encrypted-phone-phantom-secure"&gt;specifically crime-focused&lt;/a&gt; messaging services, and they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/"&gt;hijacked platforms&lt;/a&gt; like dark web marketplaces to catch illegal activity — but it’s rarer to see an agency help launch a brand-new phone network for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
