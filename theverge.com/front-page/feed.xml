    <title>Redditors are spamming Kellogg’s job portal to support striking workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kellogg Union Workers Continue Strike For Second Week" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOC8zCO4KNTy061DEcsdAMJJscU=/0x0:2736x1824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255347/1236053125.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tutDQj"&gt;Reddit’s r/antiwork is typically filled with horror stories that make you want to quit not just your own job but strangers’ jobs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXGqP"&gt;“My boss suggested I might not be able to take forty minutes to see my daughters [sic] first ever school play, so I told him try not to be a cartoon villain and he hung up on me,” reads one post from earlier this month. “That’s permission to take the whole afternoon off, right?” the post concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqhU1"&gt;The underlying ethos of r/antiwork isn’t just to be a place to vent—it’s to push back on the idea of work as we know it. So it might seem counterintuitive that on Thursday, a thread blew up that was urging members to apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAIadk"&gt;The jobs in question are permanent positions at Kellogg’s cereal plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee. The goal was to overwhelm the system with fake applications, making it a nightmare for recruiters to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NSacve"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbO5NB"&gt;Members of r/antiwork were aligning with the 1,400 Kellogg’s workers who went on strike more than two months ago over stalled union negotiations with the company. Kellogg’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062240467/kellogg-to-hire-replacements-for-striking-workers-who-rejected-a-proposed-contra"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that it would hire permanent replacement workers after those on strike voted to reject a tentative agreement with management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBuBsn"&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers,” says Kevin McKenzie, a moderator of r/antiwork. Hearing Kellogg’s workers talk about being overworked, being paid low wages, and having a poor work-life balance resonates with others, he says. “It lights a fire in the community, and you get ideas like this that spring up and get supported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1PHO2"&gt;Kellogg’s didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ermDn"&gt;Threads on r/antiwork compile timelines of the Kellogg strike, lists of products made by Kellogg to boycott, and links to the jobs that would replace striking workers. At the time of writing, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rcacru/apply_now_kellogg_is_hiring_scabs_online_lets/"&gt;the main thread&lt;/a&gt; encouraging subreddit members to flood the system with fake applications had more than 62,000 upvotes and thousands of comments. In another, members share tips on how to use features like autofill to submit applications faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSXtET"&gt;&lt;q&gt;r/antiwork has grown by 279% in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0t7pp"&gt;The striking workers are aware of the efforts, says Corrina Christensen, director of communications for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union, which represents the Kellogg’s employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyXRRD"&gt;“It’s phenomenal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w58oGu"&gt;Earlier this week, Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-recap-2021-community-reflections"&gt;highlighted r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; as being “the poster child for the great resignation.” According to the company, the subreddit has grown by 279 percent in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members. The fourth most upvoted post of 2021 was a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q82vqk/quit_my_job_last_night_it_was_nice_to_be_home_to/"&gt;thread on r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; of someone unceremoniously quitting their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et15Ov"&gt;Any organizing around flashpoints like the Kellogg’s strike is member-driven, says McKenzie. McKenzie is a graduate social work student in South Carolina who says the philosophy of antiwork resonates with him personally: he holds down multiple jobs and internships while in school, and at times, work has taken over his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRBZSj"&gt;“That’s why this kind of action gets popular,” McKenzie says. “Everybody feels the struggle, and the pain, and the misery that these Kellogg workers feel right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtRxzg"&gt;Moderators pinned a post with suggestions on how to support the strike, including flooding the job postings, but otherwise have let members take the lead. McKenzie says some members reported the job site crashing throughout the day, and the initiative has now spread to Twitter and TikTok, introducing new people to the r/antiwork community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7z8J7"&gt;It’s not the first time antiwork messages broke out of digital spaces. Last week, a slew of posts on social media suggested &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbb9d/hackers-are-spamming-businesses-receipt-printers-with-antiwork-manifestos"&gt;receipt printers&lt;/a&gt; were being hacked to spit out pro-worker manifestos, encouraging people to discuss wages with co-workers and form unions, eventually directing people to visit r/antiwork. McKenzie says the moderation team doesn’t know who’s responsible for the hacked printers — they originally thought the stunt was fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59AOD"&gt;Now some in the antiwork community see organizing around the Kellogg’s strike as an important way to turn their shared beliefs into real-world actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrrDV5"&gt;“It’s time for &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/"&gt;r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; to make the news as a formidable fighter for the average worker,” one post reads. “I submitted four applications. How many did you submit?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Eternals is coming to Disney Plus on January 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJFm_Qcf0smd2iGQ85Lmu5qmHFQ=/761x0:3335x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255240/SRA1061_comp_v023.1041.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dz6a0a"&gt;Marvel’s supersized superhero epic &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is officially going to be available to stream on Disney Plus on January 12th, Disney announced today, about two months after it was first released on November 3rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vZqVyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel’s Eternals is big, beautiful, and empty","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759203/eternals-review-marvel-studios-chloe-zhao-gemma-chan-richard-madden"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EnKTIu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; will also be available to stream in IMAX’s Expanded Aspect Ratio format, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22764957/marvel-disney-plus-imax-expanded-aspect-ratio"&gt;Disney Plus started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; on other Marvel films, including &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, and the recently released &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;, in November. The January 12th date has been floating around the internet for a few weeks already, but today marks the official confirmation from Disney of the streaming release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NARAGx"&gt;The January release for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is also perfectly placed for Disney to keep Marvel fans from canceling their subscriptions after &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; concludes later in December. Since Disney Plus first started offering original Marvel content in January 2021, there’s only been a single month (May) that lacked a major MCU release on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPK5w0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Marvel Studios' &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eternals?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Eternals&lt;/a&gt; arrives to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; on January 12 ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/yxI1FMia7b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yxI1FMia7b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1469336105484959753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cyOI5D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/eternals-encanto-west-side-story-last-duel-theaters-disney-1235061504/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reported in September&lt;/a&gt; that Disney had planned for at least 45 days of theatrical exclusivity for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; and its other late 2021 films, including &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man. &lt;/em&gt;The animated &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has at least a 30-day guarantee, which could allow Disney to move the family-friendly film to its streaming platform in time for Christmas weekend, although the studio has yet to announce an official streaming date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtV7bu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is the latest example of how much faster films are transitioning from a traditional theatrical release to a paid digital and disc release period to subscription streaming in just a matter of weeks, instead of the usual monthslong cycle. It also speaks to how important boosting Disney Plus subscription numbers is to Disney, as a long-term business strategy, one that could indicate that the swift pace of movies from theater to streaming will only continue to accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue’s Pocket will be available to order December 14th but at a higher price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Analogue Pocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctufMbQ9kO4Jlt5zfD--Jd5BD8w=/312x0:2000x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255132/4_Analogue_Pocket_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xFfr2a"&gt;Analogue has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1469336147922989061?s=21"&gt;announced in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; that it will accept orders for its Pocket handheld on December 14th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, and those who place an order will be placed into a fulfillment group, similar to the process Panic lined up with its now-delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Playdate handheld&lt;/a&gt; and the staggered rollout planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HiEUk"&gt;Those who order first on Tuesday can expect their Pocket to arrive sometime in Q1 2022. The second group will have to wait considerably longer until Q4 2022. If you aren’t quick, your order will come sometime in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SxAJWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Analogue Pocket is a gorgeous, modern handheld for playing your old Game Boy games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"},{"title":"Analogue’s Pocket will have an extremely fancy OS to save games to and from cartridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22722412/analogue-pocket-analogueos-operating-system-game-boy-retro"},{"title":"Video game handhelds didn’t die after all ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BDMEBv"&gt;As part of this announcement, Analogue shared that it’s increasing the price of the Pocket to $219 due to “industry-wide component price increases.” Though, the accessories for the handheld, which currently include an HDMI dock, hard case, and cartridge adapters to add compatibility for the likes of Sega’s Game Gear, the Neo Geo Pocket, and more, will remain at their same prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEoW3F"&gt;If you’ve already placed an order for the Analogue Pocket (lucky you), that batch of orders will begin shipping Monday, December 13th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796303/analogue-pocket-preorder-ship-date"&gt;as promised&lt;/a&gt;, and it has FedEx’s two-day shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OzRC4l"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s working on a rollable smartwatch with a camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PnktxtPTyFqEyqajtVAxcGWoqog=/0x98:1442x1059/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255067/Screen_Shot_2021_12_10_at_10.47.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung recently filed a patent depicting a rollable smartwatch display and camera&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: WIPO via LetsGoDigital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zUoAPt"&gt;Though there have been attempts at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21374933/nubia-watch-hands-on-preview-flexible-oled-kickstarter-price"&gt;wraparound smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, the gadget category itself hasn’t really seen much design innovation for quite a while. Earlier this year, there was talk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;a flat-edged Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but those turned out to be mere rumors. While it’s unlikely we’ll see drastic change any time soon, it appears tech companies have been toying with the idea of watching videos and taking photos from the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZLjY7"&gt;The latest example comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2021/12/samsung-rollable-smartwatch.pdf"&gt;a Samsung patent&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/wearables-smartwatches/samsung-rollable-watch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LetsGoDigital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/12/09/samsung-designs-smartwatch-with-rolling-display-and-centered-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peta Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Originally filed in June with the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO), the patent depicts a Galaxy Watch with a rollable screen and camera smack dab in the middle. The watch concept looks like an average round-faced watch, but pressing the crown allows you to extend the screen further into a sort of pill-shaped oval that’s 40 percent larger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyyf7v"&gt;In addition to novel ways of displaying information, Samsung also seems to think a larger screen might entice people to watch videos from the wrist. One drawing depicts a potential user watching what appears to be Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; on the watch. As for the camera, the schematics show a design where it’s located in the middle of the watch and is intended for taking photos or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C2b3a"&gt;It’s not out of left field that Samsung might try to extend its foldable screen tech to wearables. Samsung has experimented with cameras &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/smartwatch-with-camera-1637240/"&gt;in wrist-based wearables before&lt;/a&gt;. Meta is also purportedly working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;a smartwatch that will house not one but two cameras&lt;/a&gt;. And while there is no camera in the Apple Watch, there is the Wristcam, a $299 third-party strap with a built-in camera that can also be used for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-apple-watch-camera-band-brings-live-video-to-your-1847152682"&gt;short-form video chatting&lt;/a&gt;. All of this is neat from a technological perspective, but as a wearables reviewer, I can tell you one thing: cameras and videos on smartwatches don’t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm6YWQ561pize2gl19HXcdBpuBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078692/Screen_Shot_2021_12_10_at_10.30.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: WIPO via LetsGoDigital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would you watch a movie on the wrist?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7PdZ8T"&gt;For many, one of the smartwatch’s greatest “flaws” is that it’s a companion device. While you can do a lot with it on its own, it’s still limited without your smartphone. For example, replying to texts is tedious no matter how large the screen or how accurate your voice assistant is. Anything more than a quick “yes” or “on my way” requires you to whip out your phone. Poor battery life also means taking long calls just isn’t an option. Standalone capability is improving, however. More advanced models have LTE and contactless payments, which means you can safely leave your phone behind for quick jaunts around the neighborhood. But when it comes to taking photos and videos, smartwatches can’t replace your phone in any capacity just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t38Wuy"&gt;That’s probably the idea behind this nascent push to add cameras to our wrists. We’re all video chatting now, and wrist communicators have been buried deep into our collective psyche thanks to spy flicks like &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt; and sci-fi classics like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. When you take a call from the wrist, however, you can do so naturally. You don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to hold up your arm in a specific way to be heard — you can just continue what you were doing. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; for cameras and video chats. When I tested the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-apple-watch-camera-band-brings-live-video-to-your-1847152682"&gt;Wristcam’s video chat for the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, one of the things I hadn’t anticipated was how tired my arm felt after holding it up to capture my face at a flattering angle. Likewise, it’s easy to take out your phone, snap a photo, and get on with your day. Contorting your wrist to get a picture is less fun and more awkward to do in public. The effort doesn’t make sense when my phone is &lt;em&gt;right there&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8PqCt"&gt;Watching videos from the wrist is less than ideal for the same reasons. While testing the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsung-had-to-fix-one-thing-with-the-galaxy-watch-acti-1838454731"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2&lt;/a&gt;, I attempted to view a Bon Appetit YouTube video — partly because Samsung said I could, partly because I wanted to know what watching a video on such a small screen would be like. It worked, but that’s the best I can say about that experience. The screen was too small, the video was laggy, streaming video zapped battery life, and the app crashed more than once. It’s uncomfortable to hold your arm for an ideal viewing position for an extended period. Even if you could increase the screen size, I cannot fathom watching all 149 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Avengers:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; from the wrist when I could reach into my pocket for my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyF17R"&gt;And these are just the technical obstacles. Privacy is an &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2015/10/00050-98093.pdf"&gt;entire bag of worms&lt;/a&gt; that no wearable company has effectively “solved” yet. These are incredibly personal devices, and they collect treasure troves of data. Privacy concerns are a major obstacle to wearable adoption, and you just have to recall the Google Glass Explorer Edition to understand how adding cameras to mix could go terribly wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzaV2x"&gt;Perhaps one day, tech companies will figure out a way for smartwatch cameras to work without all the extra steps and tradeoffs. But in the meantime, cameras on smartwatches aren’t something most consumers are yearning for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Better CEO who fired 900 people over a Zoom call is taking time off </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMFz_hjUsHDrwvjuEz6wQZJxFio=/177x0:1530x902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255034/better_ceo_garg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CEO Vishal Garg is reportedly taking time off from Better.com, the company he founded in 2012. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/215031211" target="_blank"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wkWRnz"&gt;The CEO of digital mortgage firm &lt;a href="http://Better.com"&gt;Better.com&lt;/a&gt;, who fired 900 employees on a Zoom call last week, is taking time off from the company while it conducts a “leadership and cultural assessment,” according to an email to employees from the board of directors. As first &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmpab/better-ceo-taking-time-off-effective-immediately-email"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the board’s email says following “the very regrettable events over the last week,” CEO Vishal Garg will be taking time off “effective immediately,” and Better CFO Kevin Ryan will manage day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIX3os"&gt;Better, which Garg founded in 2012, has been in the spotlight after he held a Zoom call with 900 employees on December 3rd to inform them they were losing their jobs. “If you’re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off,” Garg reportedly said on the call. He lamented that it was not the first time he had to conduct layoffs: “The last time I did it, I cried, this time I hope to be stronger.” The video call was captured by Better employees and widely circulated on social media. It has since been taken down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP0g7G"&gt;Garg later sent a &lt;a href="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/A8SA0YBW/at/ggkbfpsbjbvc335cprpv33bg/A_Message_From_Our_Founder___CEO.pdf"&gt;message to Better employees&lt;/a&gt; apologizing for how he handled the layoffs. “I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected, and for their contributions to Better,” Garg wrote. “I realize that the way I communicated the news made a difficult situation worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axdWe5"&gt;Following the news of the layoffs, reports of Garg’s past insensitive comments and behavior began to trickle out; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpgkm/bettercom-ceo-called-top-investor-sewage-said-making-company-money-would-earn-employees-freedom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; he once referred to a top investor in Better as “sewage” and reportedly told Better employees that instead of taking a day off for Indigenous Peoples’ Day, it was better for them to work and earn the company “capital, and therefore our freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sUfaOs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jCbv6y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/better-com-laid-off-900-workers-over-zoom-day-after-spac-merger-deal-delayed?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Better pushed back its planned SPAC, which was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. On November 30th, Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank amended the terms of their financing agreement with Better, giving the mortgage company a cash infusion of about $750 million. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the day after the new SPAC terms were announced, Garg fired the 900 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlvZyh"&gt;Better did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtGJDZ"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Po5F12"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6503871388&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AvowYU"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Alex Heath to talk about his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0OK80eljWrs"&gt;discussion with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss&lt;/a&gt; on making &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt; with Epic Games to demo Unreal Engine 5 and how technology is blurring the line between what’s real and virtual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwpH70"&gt;Alex stays on for the entire show because there is so much to talk about — including a hands-on experience of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;Snap’s first AR Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827037/google-android-games-windows-pc-google-play-games"&gt;Google bringing Android games to Windows&lt;/a&gt; next year, the clash between Roku and YouTube, and this week in metaverse news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citing fires, London’s transport agency bans e-scooters on public transit network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oxford Street eScooters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/heOVGarToe2yyx5fP-S0qiVKk0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254626/1236077312.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;E-scooters have been banned on London’s transport network after several fires. | photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoxkgC"&gt;Transport for London &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/december/tfl-announces-safety-ban-of-e-scooters-on-transport-network"&gt;announced a ban on all e-scooters&lt;/a&gt; on its network, effective December 13th, over safety concerns following recent fires. The ban will apply to all public transport in London, including underground trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alhAhv"&gt;E-scooters are currently banned on UK roads and sidewalks, but shops can still sell them for use on private land. The only legal e-scooters in use in London are the ones part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440320/london-electric-scooter-rental-trial-dott-lime-tier"&gt;rental trials that started over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. The ban does not include mobility scooters that are permitted on TfL’s network, and foldable e-bikes are still permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5HrBU"&gt;“We have been extremely worried by the recent incidents on our public transport services, which involved intense fires and considerable smoke and damage,” said TfL’s chief safety, health, and environment officer Lilli Matson. “We have worked with London Fire Brigade to determine how we should deal with these devices and, following that review, we have decided to ban them. Customers who try to bring them onto our network will be refused access to our stations and premises, and not be permitted to use any of our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjbdl"&gt;TfL did not reference specific fires, but local news &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1515958/electric-scooter-london-underground-battery-fire-explosion"&gt;reported on an incident&lt;/a&gt; in November, when an e-scooter exploded in a London Underground station, causing black smoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHmjXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exclusive - Footage shows the dangers of escooter battery fires on the tube. This happened on Monday night. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSSAunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TSSAunion&lt;/a&gt; calling for a ban on carrying escooters on public transport saying they’re a “significant threat”. More BBC1 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BBCLondonNews&lt;/a&gt; 1330 &amp;amp; 1830 &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AnnXezXTE2"&gt;https://t.co/AnnXezXTE2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCjNLtlKDu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCjNLtlKDu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Edwards (@BBCTomEdwards) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCTomEdwards/status/1455869992738725892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2pxsW"&gt;The transport agency said the incidents it referenced were caused by “defective lithium-ion batteries which ruptured without warning,” which led to fires that cause toxic smoke. If such a fire happened in an enclosed area, it could lead to significant harm to staff and customers, TfL said in its news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpNV8"&gt;Anyone who violates the ban could face a fine of up to £1,000 (about $1,300 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="johXIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5bhj6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnW9VfhCNWpOs0U3DDdAmYgUKuc=/0x1169:4247x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254547/Eve_Energy_Lifestyle_US_Christmas_2020_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve is upgrading all its compatible products —such as its Eve Energy smart plug — to the Matter smart home standard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve Home&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yrI7o"&gt;Eve, the makers of high-end Apple HomeKit smart home gadgets for home security, energy, and lighting, has been leading the charge for the new Matter standard for a while now, specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;its primary protocol Thread&lt;/a&gt;. As one of the first device makers to release Thread-based products, Eve just announced its tenth device to get the promised hardware upgrade — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;$99.99 Eve Room indoor air quality monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2QdSa"&gt;With almost half of its existing products now Thread-enabled and ready for Matter, the company is turning its attention to the rest of its portfolio. Jerome Gackel, CEO of Eve Systems, confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Eve will be launching a Thread-enabled Eve Water Guard (a leak detector) in February 2022 and an Eve Flare (a portable lamp) in March; and Thread versions of the Eve Light Switch (a hardwired wall switch) and the Eve Motion (a motion sensor) will follow shortly. These two products are getting more than just a new radio, however, both will get an entirely new design, says Gackel. The new Eve Motion will include a luminosity sensor (a digital light sensor).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpmek897yWnDILLgRtgYdOzPbu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078440/Image_12_10_21_at_9.01_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve Home&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve Room — an indoor air quality monitor with an E Ink screen — is the latest Eve product to receive a hardware upgrade to Thread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="edj8nx"&gt;The company is also entering a brand-new product category: smart shades. &lt;a href="https://motionblinds.com/eve/"&gt;Eve MotionBlinds&lt;/a&gt; are rechargeable battery-powered smart motors for &lt;a href="https://coulisse.com/"&gt;Coulisse shades&lt;/a&gt;. They will launch in January and will be HomeKit certified alongside using a Thread radio and being upgraded to Matter when the standard launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnLXYI"&gt;Eve has committed to upgrading all its existing compatible devices to Matter when the standard is expected to arrive in June 2022, starting with its US smart plug Eve Energy and the Eve Motion and Eve Door &amp;amp; Window sensors. The second rollout will cover its light switches (US and European versions), the Eve Thermo radiator valve in the fall, and Eve Weather, Eve Room, and Eve Energy (UK and Australian editions) at the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHKq7H"&gt;This leaves only the company’s indoor camera out of the Thread party (at least in terms of its US products). The Eve Cam works over Wi-Fi, which is supported by Matter, but cameras aren’t part of the Matter specification yet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve Home&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Weather is one of Eve’s ten products that have already received the hardware upgrade to Thread, along with the Eve Aqua, Eve Door &amp;amp; Window sensor, and Eve Energy smart plug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7LQC2f"&gt;However, as Gackle &lt;a href="https://staceyoniot.com/iot-news-of-the-week-for-dec-3-2021/"&gt;first told Stacey Higginbotham&lt;/a&gt;, some customers may not want to rush to Matter initially. “It’s a reality that when Matter launches, it won’t support every functionality of every manufacturer’s devices right away,” Gackel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Over time, it will. So, if a user is specifically using an Eve device for function X, Y, or Z, they should confirm it will be supported at Matter’s launch, or possibly choose to stay on HomeKit via Thread until it (function X, Y, or Z) is supported in the near future.” Gackel says he’s confident that all the functions will be supported on Matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW73LW"&gt;Eve says its switchover from Bluetooth to Thread has already been “a spectacular success” for the company, helping improve its sensors’ speed, range, reliability, and battery life. “We’ve had roughly more than 5,000 emails from happy customers telling us how good it is now,” says Gackel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkStQS"&gt;And while Thread devices require a border router (such as a HomePod Mini) to communicate with each other, Gackel is confident these will quickly become ubiquitous. “We believe more and more Wi-Fi routers will embed Thread directly, as with Eero today,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yKcmmU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Matter is clearly a game-changer in the smart home” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hVdxw"&gt;To date, Eve has been an Apple HomeKit-only option due to the company’s commitment to not using a cloud-based system. This has meant no Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Samsung SmartThings integrations. Also, no Android support. With Matter, Eve can branch out without giving up its core privacy-first, no-cloud principles, as the new smart home standard is an entirely local protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f8fQV"&gt;With Matter, the connection to Alexa and Google will be local and won’t require cloud-to-cloud communication. “So, we will keep this uniqueness of privacy,” says Gackel. “Matter is clearly a game-changer in the smart home. In 2022 when a product is Matter-certified, you have the guarantee that it works seamlessly with all the four major platforms — Google, Apple, Amazon, and Samsung — and with whatever smartphone is in the hand of the consumer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VefHlB"&gt;Eve is already working toward compatibility with Samsung, SmartThings, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home, and Gackel says it’s been selected by each company for its early adopter program. Currently, Eve’s app only works on iPhones. Gackel says the company is still determining whether to develop an Android app or whether integration with Matter will be enough to make its products accessible to all smart home users, not just those with Apple iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FO85q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The e-bike revolution comes to the Bronx</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO83QNmT2m8fGaZBoLrxRwsDbLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254544/ahawkins_211202_4915_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;E-bike companies are teaming up with local non-profits to provide discounts to frontline workers. Could this be a nationwide model?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uYylyH"&gt;On a recent chilly December afternoon, a small parking lot in the industrial Hunts Point section of the Bronx was alive with the sounds of bicycle bells. Representatives from companies like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, Zomoo, The Hub NYC, Ride Panda, and others were mingling about a half dozen local residents — drivers, janitors, landscapers, and home health aides — initiating them in the burgeoning electric bike revolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gc7fmw"&gt;These were the first participants in &lt;a href="https://equitablecommuteproject.carrd.co/"&gt;the Equitable Commute Project&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based coalition of non-profit organizations, strategy groups, university researchers, and financial lenders. The goal was to make e-bikes more accessible and more affordable to people in low-income communities, reduce their dependence on cars, and ultimately, create more jobs in the green economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uUz2K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where’s my training wheels?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RSKEZ4"&gt;Michael Scanlon, a driver for the Hope Program, a workforce development non-profit involved in the project, was there to pick up a brand new VanMoof e-bike. A hefty guy with graying hair and a thick New York accent, Scanlon had only one question after listening to a representative from the Dutch company run through the bike’s features: “Where’s my training wheels?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQTmVF"&gt;But after taking his new e-bike out for an inaugural spin, Scanlon’s New York attitude melted away. “It’s been a rough year for me, personally,” he told me. “I had a pacemaker put in, a gallbladder taken out, three deaths in the family. So I wanted to buy myself a little Christmas gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HNjlmJzHYzibW_GI3IrsReUGls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070378/ahawkins_211202_4915_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Scanlon, a driver from the Bronx, tries out his new VanMoof e-bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R6FDnT"&gt;Scanlon will have some help. Through a partnership with Spring Bank and grants from the state government, the Equitable Commute Project is hoping to subsidize the cost of his VanMoof by up to 50 percent. That means instead of shelling out $2,298 for the S3 e-bike, he would only have to pay $1,149. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il7tYL"&gt;Across the country, community groups are soliciting e-bike companies for help competing for state money in the hopes of getting more people riding. Cities like &lt;a href="https://bikeportland.org/2021/01/27/pge-grants-will-stoke-e-bike-boom-in-portland-325318"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/zero-emission-vehicles/can-do-colorado-ebike-pilot-program"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sharedmobility.org/e-bikepilot"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; are launching pilot projects that explore ways to subsidize e-bike purchases for low-income families or collect enough bikes together to launch mini-shared micromobility services. But the goal isn’t just to get more people on e-bikes; it’s also about reducing tailpipe emissions and saving the planet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2n4ipo"&gt;​​E-bikes are more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000 for some high-end cargo bikes. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, which could help make real progress in the fight against climate change. A recent study found that if just 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a33798099/e-bikes-can-reduce-carbon-emissions-study/#:~:text=Take%20an%20E%2DBike%20to,emissions%20would%20drop%2012%20percent.&amp;amp;text=Research%20from%20a%20recent%20study,reducing%20carbon%20emissions%20in%20cities."&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="moZPQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s the climate piece of ‘let’s get people out of cars and onto bikes’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oABHfv"&gt;“There’s the climate piece of ‘let’s get people out of cars and onto bikes,’” said Ash Lovell, e-bike campaign coordinator for People for Bikes, a group that lobbies on behalf of the bike industry. “The more people you get on bikes, the safer biking is for everyone [and] the more incentive there is to build better biking infrastructure. And the more people you get out of cars, the less traffic congestion you have and the better air quality you have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MVgxx"&gt;Depending on where you live, people interested in buying an e-bike can get financial assistance in the form of a rebate or tax credit. California, for example, offer a range of financial assistance to residents, &lt;a href="https://www.calbike.org/4-ways-to-get-financial-help-to-buy-an-e-bike/"&gt;including a tax credit&lt;/a&gt; for people who trade in their polluting car for an e-bike. And e-bikes could get a huge boost if Congress approves President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751273/ebike-tax-credit-build-back-better-biden"&gt;a tax credit of up to $900 for e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR0GNp"&gt;But rebates and tax credits aren’t the best way to get more people from low-income communities using e-bikes, said Melinda Hanson, founder of Electric Avenue, a strategy firm that helped launch the Equitable Commute Project in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="potO4y"&gt;“These feel nebulous for most consumers,” she said. “Subsidies at the purchase point are more tangible and likely to be much more effective, especially for lower-income folks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvidkxvNSpAcL3vGUoOqa8pi8Rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070380/ahawkins_211202_4915_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A representative from VanMoof gives an overview of the company’s e-bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="azm2tU"&gt;Hanson said the project aims to eventually provide bikes to 5,000 people in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Manufacturers like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, and Zoomo are covering the subsidy costs for this initial batch of e-bikes, but the project leaders are hoping that fundraising, and a &lt;a href="https://www.electricmobilitychallenge.org/"&gt;$7 million grant from New York State&lt;/a&gt;, will help provide the cash that’s needed to offer future discounts. The group has built out a list of 600 interested people and has had to limit outreach while it continues to fundraise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtfzhj"&gt;Unlike a rebate or a tax credit, the Equitable Commute Project is working with Spring Bank to launch a new financing product to cover the remaining balance of the bike. It’s accessible to those with little or no credit history and is repaid through paycheck deductions with their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FckUSu"&gt;&lt;q&gt; e-bike loans of up to $2,500&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="28aZA8"&gt;The project has focused its outreach on institutions in the Bronx that employ large numbers of frontline workers, including BronxWorks, Montefiore Medical Center, and Urban Health Network. According to Melanie Stern, director of consumer lending at Spring Bank, frontline workers can access e-bike loans of up to $2,500 or Employee Opportunity loans of up to $3,500. “The process is fintech-enabled,” Stern said, “so participating is really simple both for the employer and the borrower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQ54DJ"&gt;The project is also proving to be a convenient opportunity for transportation researchers to learn more about the interaction between cyclists and motor vehicles. Suzana Duran Bernardes is a PhD candidate at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering. Working with the university’s &lt;a href="https://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/"&gt;C2SMART Center&lt;/a&gt;, she came up with a device that attaches to the downtube of the e-bikes that are being distributed by the Equitable Commute Project. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX1rQAMBWQodtV4i1AKbt0P_kq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070376/ahawkins_211202_4915_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A sensor used by NYU researchers to gather data about bike usage. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xpGnOW"&gt;While the person is riding, the sensors collect data on speed, acceleration, distance, and trajectory, as well as the proximity of other cars and trucks on the road. The goal is to learn more about how people use e-bikes and produce studies into safety, gender equity in cycling, and urban planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbmJMM"&gt;“We want to benefit as many of the people as possible,” Duran Bernardes said. “Agencies, researchers, cyclists... this data can be useful to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrs1k1"&gt;One of those people who could use some more assurances about the safety of cycling is Shakira Hart, a supervisor for a local landscaping company. Hart, who lives in the Bronx, doesn’t own a car and usually walks to work, no matter the weather. An e-bike will help cut her commute time in half — but first, she has to learn how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qJa5c5"&gt;“There’s a little bit more technicality than I prefer,” Hart said while straddling her new bike from Zoomo. “I figure, you know, once I review the manual, I’ll be good.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook finally has live chat support for people who are locked out of their accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3IPyIc3U6JrX1lSwDvmOyYFDkNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254422/acastro_171002_1777_0004_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook artwork | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HUoFkY"&gt;Despite eagerly participating in a platform vs. platform war of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791007/facebook-live-audio-rooms-paying-creators-musicians"&gt;escalating financial incentives to attract creators&lt;/a&gt;, one area where critics have said Facebook / Meta / Instagram is lacking is in the ability to provide basic support for those online stars. Whether that’s through community moderation and page management tools or making sure they have someone to reach if they’re locked out of their account suddenly, it has been a consistent issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlDqT2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/comment-moderation-and-support"&gt;Now it’s trying to change that&lt;/a&gt;, announcing a “small test” of live chat support for English-speaking creators in the US who don’t have an assigned relationship manager. That way these midtier internet stars can get a quick response if they have questions about a payout, or, for example, how to use a new feature for Instagram Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLBe"&gt;Another element that’s even more crucial is for those who are locked out of their account for one reason or another. A report by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/creators-instagram-dealers-restore-accounts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August detailed an underground economy of people who claim to have inside access at Meta and charge money to help with account restoration. For people who use social media as their business, they may feel they have no choice but to pay, especially when normal customer support avenues are unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook Support on iOS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LWrpEl0hMRpW8kEftuw3bbAUNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078462/facebook_support.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Support on iOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0GADP4"&gt;Facebook says it’s now testing “live chat help for some English-speaking users globally, including creators, who’ve been locked out of their accounts.” The company says it’s the first time it has offered live support for the issue and that it’s focusing on people who can’t log in either due to unusual activity or because they’ve reportedly violated its community standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook ‘spotlight conversation’" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlcoBu7ioa72AbXRNrfb4TeH2yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078468/comment_0facebook.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s “spotlight conversation”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtUV1g"&gt;Other changes it’s announced this week include better comment moderation with keyword blocking, moderation assistance that can auto-hide comments with links or images, the ability to block a user along with any new accounts they try to make later, and a dedicated spot to view hidden comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJS262"&gt;If you’re trying to go live and build a fan base, then you’ll be able to do it with more people, as Facebook has added the ability co-broadcast with up to three additional guests. You can also share those live broadcasts as Facebook Stories that pop to the top of your followers’ feeds, as well as badges and front row privileges that make it easier for the host to know when particularly dedicated fans are watching. Finally, video hosts can also add featured links that viewers can click without leaving the video and polls that work on mobile just like they already did on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
