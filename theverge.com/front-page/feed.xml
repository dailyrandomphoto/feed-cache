    <title>The M1 chip saved the MacBook — but now Apple has to win back the Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4l2XlWncu_NJxoMg-48F50FA97w=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010098/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmKgkS"&gt;It’s been hard to be an Apple power user for the last half-decade. The glory days of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082649/macbook-pro-review-retina-display-15-inch"&gt;original Retina MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; have long since vanished into the sunset, and recent years have seen computers with too many compromises and too few ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sHmmI"&gt;And while Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;first wave of M1-powered computers&lt;/a&gt; have been excellent, they’ve all been — relatively — low-powered. The MacBook Air, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; are the cheapest computers Apple makes, meant more for checking email, writing essays, and the occasional light photo editing than they are for cranking out 4K video or Photoshop projects hundreds of layers deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGc7pu"&gt;That may be about to change with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;presumed announcement&lt;/a&gt; of new, high-end MacBook Pro models, computers that are rumored to be Apple’s biggest laptop update in years. And new MacBook Pros are an opportunity for the company to get back the professional users that have been underserved and disappointed by the lackluster laptop options that the company has been releasing for several cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiGuga82ESb5W11HZbajTPY8QeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7461807/jbareham_161108_1263_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;James Bareham&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="It3gls"&gt;Apple’s last major redesign for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13616404/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-review-2016-13-inch-15-inch-laptop"&gt;MacBook Pro came in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and made several missteps: the stripping away of SD card, HDMI, and USB-A ports (all essential tools for photographers, video editors, musicians, and other professional workers) in favor of exclusively using USB-C. There was the addition of the largely useless Touch Bar instead of reliable function keys. And, of course, the extremely fragile keyboard, which was prone to breaking on contact with dust or debris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ213a"&gt;Subsequent models have tried to address some of those complaints (Apple finally reverted back to the older style keyboard and added a physical escape key to newer models of the MacBook Pro), but the overall approach of what should be Apple’s most functional devices still focus more on the form. Life as a professional on a Mac has meant dealing with too many dongles, buying new cables, and endlessly hunting around for an SD card adapter just to import files. All while getting processors that are years behind Windows devices, with screens that haven’t meaningfully changed since 2012, on computers that Apple charges a premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyk7gX"&gt;And hardcore users have been waiting for a while, especially compared to Apple’s last chip changeover. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be transitioning its entire product lineup over to Apple Silicon products in 2020 (and away from the Intel chips that it had used since its last major architecture switch in 2005), it announced a two-year goal of getting all its products switched over. But a year in, and only Apple’s least powerful devices have made the change. If you want a more powerful laptop or desktop, then you’re still getting the old Intel models — models that, while still not on Apple Silicon hardware, also haven’t been updated with new &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; hardware in over a year and a half either. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 16-inch MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2nqxLgoH1jWenTk56aWR8IE3Xw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19395182/vpavic_191118_3800_0077.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hblvj1"&gt;The most powerful 16-inch MacBook Pro you can buy right now — ostensibly Apple’s best and beefiest laptop — features a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k"&gt;9th-generation Intel Core i7 processor from early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Mac users aren’t just missing out on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;new 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, bringing generational changes in battery life and performance; they didn’t even get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21203222/intel-10th-gen-h-series-laptop-processors-comet-lake-14nm-5-ghz-clock-speeds-gaming"&gt;more modest upgrades&lt;/a&gt; from Intel’s 2020 10th-gen chips, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJxb3I"&gt;Compare this whole sluggish Apple Silicon transition to the original Intel one, which happened much more swiftly; Apple announced the change in June 2005, released the first Intel-based Macs in January 2006, and had completely switched over its full product line with the Intel-powered Mac Pro in August 2006 — just eight months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2sH5E"&gt;Apple managed to change its entire lineup to Intel in just over a year, from announcement to release, the last time around. But with Apple Silicon, we’re already a year into this transition, and there are still a lot of crucial, unanswered questions. The current M1 chips only offer integrated GPUs, with no discrete graphics options available for more graphically intensive tasks (like those that video editors or graphic designers might need). Apple doesn’t sell an M1 device with more than 16GB of RAM, nor does it offer a laptop with more than two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports — all areas that the company would likely have to address in some fashion on a pro-focused machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XZas6"&gt;Plus, if Apple does fail at translating the success of its M1 chips to its more powerful machines, Intel is still ready and willing to try and pick up the slack. “I never give up on the idea of anything not running on Intel chips,” commented Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/axios/status/1449891228099694597"&gt;in an interview with Axios&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple decided that they could do a better chip than we could, and they did a pretty good job. So what I have to do is create a better chip than they can do themselves...  I’m gonna fight hard to win Tim [Cook’s] business in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tPsYqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A year in, and there’s a lot of unanswered questions for professional-level Apple Silicon computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1eL96N"&gt;There are theoretical benefits to the delay: developers have had a full year to transition their apps over to Apple’s M1 architecture. Things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584992/adobe-premiere-pro-apple-m1-support"&gt;key creative applications&lt;/a&gt; like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere, and Lightroom have all been natively ported to Apple’s new chips, and those updates took months to roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuS6ZX"&gt;Plus, a switch to Apple’s own in-house chips might not just mean the kind of performance and speed boosts that customers have been enjoying on the company’s less powerful machines. It also could mean an end to the glacial pace of upgrades for Mac processors. With Intel chips, Apple’s computers almost universally lagged behind their Windows-based competitors, taking months or even years to upgrade to Intel’s latest chips (and the performance and power benefits that newer silicon provided).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSxEtV"&gt;And if the rumors are correct, Apple is taking the new chips as an opportunity to roll out a new design for its MacBook Pro line, with bigger, better Mini LED displays, smaller bezels, more ports, and even the return of its breakaway magnetic MagSafe chargers — changes that would both modernize the lineup to be more on par with Windows competitors (which have long since lapped Apple in things like display technology) in addition to rolling back some of the more controversial aspects of the Touch Bar era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um9Ija"&gt;With the first wave of Apple Silicon Macs, Apple proved it could make the best laptops around for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people. But Apple’s new MacBook Pros aren’t just about winning over power users — it’s a chance to prove that Apple Silicon (and the traditionally mobile-focused Arm technology it uses) can not only match but exceed what Intel and AMD have accomplished for years with x86 for high-end use cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5Ephw"&gt;And if Apple can succeed at that, it won’t just mean better laptops or desktops, but what could be the start of changing how we fundamentally think about designing computers — at least the inside of them — going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apuU1H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZJaLg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy 3 electric bike review: better safe than sporty</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Whoa boy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DutWqd"&gt;Cowboy has returned with its third-generation e-bike. It’s still the best-looking pedal-assisted electric bike &lt;em&gt;with a removable battery&lt;/em&gt; that I’ve ever seen having carried forward the same physical design as the original Cowboy. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18656321/cowboy-e-bike-preview-price-date-removable-battery"&gt;Cowboy 2&lt;/a&gt; from last year was sporty, the Cowboy 3 is mature, focusing on safety rather than fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9yjzQ"&gt;The Cowboy 3 is fitted with a variety of safety features including automatic crash detection, a slower top speed, and new puncture-resistant tires of Cowboy design. Version three, like the previous model, also has integrated lighting, with a rear light that flashes red when braking. And believe it or not, Cowboy’s finally making fenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Su8TV"&gt;It’s as if this Belgian startup wants to become the Volvo of e-bikes. Not that that’s a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AMgOh6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9448925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fK5lMl"&gt;The headline feature is automatic &lt;a href="https://help.cowboy.com/en/articles/4314702#what-to-do-if-youve-been-selected-as-an-emergency-contact"&gt;crash detection&lt;/a&gt;, which the company calls an industry first. It’s available on both Cowboy 3 and older Cowboy 2 bikes via a free software update. Crash detection works by analyzing data collected from the wheel’s speed sensor, torque sensor, and accelerometer to determine if a crash occurred. The company says it can tell the difference between a crash and emergency braking, dropping your bike on its side, hitting a pothole, or riding over cobblestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3BAw3"&gt;If a crash is detected, the rider has 60 seconds to confirm they’re okay in the app, or else the SIM card integrated into the Cowboy e-bike sends an alert to one, or both, of your predefined emergency contacts. It also sends along a real-time map showing the rider’s position measured by the bike’s GPS radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmrnDK"&gt;I was able to simulate a crash with the help of a soft couch. After dropping the bike while holding the brake and pressing down on a pedal, the front and rear lights started flashing rapidly to draw attention to the area. At the same time, a text message was received by my emergency contact saying I “might have been involved in a bike accident” with my approximate street address and a link to a live map showing my precise location. I can imagine this being a useful and even life-saving feature if crash detection performs this well in real-life scenarios. Otherwise, false alarms could create a lot of stress for loved ones (Cowboy claims a false positive rate of “close to zero”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6rdN6ie4yX6fhLJEAon2Aq6Egk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21907036/verge_DSC_0787_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removable battery and future on / off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYTbPWzPXioaVtiUrqc9xvq69Gs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21907035/verge_DSC_0791_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;250W single-speed rear-hub motor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mu0xPwxqLKJSPxqmShVNERToW58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21907028/verge_DSC_0895_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear light flashes when braking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgKYWaRTVZYPij7gL1KRMWpKU5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21907032/verge_DSC_0847_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smartphone required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rXHLUT"&gt;Another safety feature was added by taking something away: off-road mode, a setting intended for riding Cowboys on private property. Cowboy e-bikes are now capped at the European limit of 25km/h (15.5mph). Previously, Cowboy’s off-road mode sneakily boosted the speed cap to 30km/h (19mph) to complement the e-bike’s sporty riding position. In practice, I imagine that many, if not most, Cowboy owners used that mode all the time. I sure did, especially when beyond the city limits where I regularly bike between 25-30km/h. I really missed the faster, more exciting mode in my testing. I’m told that Cowboy removed it for safety and insurance reasons: Cowboy offers owners &lt;a href="https://cowboy.com/pages/easy-rider"&gt;Easy Rider insurance plans&lt;/a&gt; starting at €8 per month for theft or €10 per month to add damage coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCWiDQ"&gt;The Cowboy 3 does have a free Find My Bike feature that uses GPS and Bluetooth to help locate your bike. But you’ll need to pay at least €8 per month to receive theft detection notifications. The anti-theft protection kicks in two minutes after the Cowboy is turned off. Then, whenever your bike is jostled, presumably by a thief, it’ll send an alert to your phone showing the reported GPS location. The bike can then be tracked with the help of the (very good) Cowboy app with Bluetooth allowing you to hone in on your bike with greater precision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YINEqH"&gt;My test bike had theft detection enabled and it worked for the most part. When enabled, the bike’s lights flash briefly (there’s no siren or warning sound) and the alert arrives quickly in the app. You can then ignore it or hit “Find My Bike” and take your chances with confronting a would-be thief or someone who innocently bumped your bike in the shared bike rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9w6isq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cowboy continues to deliver one of the most natural pedal-assisted ride experiences of any e-bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R3Zgs9"&gt;As for the ride, Cowboy’s own silent 250W rear-hub motor coupled with a new, longer-lasting Gates Carbon Belt drive and lower gear ratio produces a highly intuitive experience. Power is delivered as soon as the bike detects pressure on the pedal for effortless getaways in the flats, and then the bike’s speed and torque sensors constantly adjust power delivery as your pace and pedaling change. When I tested it on hills, however, I felt the bike lacked the vertical oomph delivered by other single-speed belt-driven bikes like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;Gogoro’s Eeyo 1S&lt;/a&gt;, requiring more exertion than I expected. Nevertheless, overall the Cowboy continues to deliver one of, if not the most natural pedal-assisted ride experiences of any e-bike I’ve tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEhOQ8"&gt;My range test delivered 70.5km (43.8 miles) from the 360Wh battery, which is exactly in line with Cowboy’s “up to 70km” claim. Best of all, that battery can be removed and taken inside for convenient charging. The bike is still rideable with a dead battery, but many will struggle to pedal a 16.9kg / 37-pound bike over long distances with just a single gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFx2gx"&gt;After a software update, the Cowboy 3 can now be tuned on without a smartphone. The &lt;a href="https://help.cowboy.com/en/articles/4634801-unlock-your-bike"&gt;”Manual Unlock” mode&lt;/a&gt; allows the e-bike to be turned on by ejecting and re-inserting the battery within 20 seconds. It’s not very elegant, and requires that you carry the key, but it could keep you from getting stranded should you lose your smartphone or its battery dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dgQeOa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9448972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kxz8f5"&gt;New this year is an automatic startup option that uses Bluetooth to detect when you’re nearby. It works so long as the app is running in the background. The new feature means you can leave your phone in a pocket or bag when you’re ready to ride. In practice, it works pretty well: the bike sensed me approaching and then required me to move it a little to actually turn the motor on. The bike can also be set to turn off automatically, or not, after a period of inactivity, giving you a chance to lock it up with a chain (or two) and walk away without triggering the anti-theft alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzFLr1"&gt;Cowboy is working on a feature that lets you turn on the bike by removing and reinserting the battery. It was originally promised last year, but I’m told that it’s definitely coming by the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E2QiK"&gt;The last big feature for Cowboy owners is the free Cowboy Mobile Service. While under the two-year guarantee, Cowboy will send a technician to your home, office, or places in between to repair your bike. The CMS service is currently available in 25 European cities, expanding to 70 by the end of the year, Cowboy tells me. Rad Power, for example, offers a similar service but charges a fee for each use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmLYmI"&gt;Other observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5gLZZdz54R44DMsz9ECe-WOzXjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21907088/app-air-quality-benl_w_3sm.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New feature will route you around areas of poor air quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YePUoQ"&gt;Cowboys don’t have throttles — they’re pedal assist only, and it’s either on or off, without power options like eco or sport found on other e-bikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9Soels"&gt;The spongy grips, stock saddle, and wide puncture-resistant tires of Cowboy design did a fine job of gobbling up road vibrations, even on the bumpy bricked roads common in Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RbTV25"&gt;The Cowboy app will soon, by early October, inform riders about the air quality in the area and suggest the least polluted route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mH22aV"&gt;Cowboy 3 is now available in two shades of gray to go along with the black model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bvzTau"&gt;The LEDs in the battery meter on the top tube can be set to bright or dim and are mostly visible in the sun in bright mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PX5uhw"&gt;The Cowboy logo above the battery meter isn’t a power button, but it should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n6VB2P"&gt;Cowboy 3 weighs 16.9kg / 37 pounds, four ounces, making it about 900 grams heavier than the Cowboy 2 due mainly to the beefy new tires. The mudguards add some additional, undisclosed weight. It’s also made to fit relatively tall riders, measuring 170 to 195cm (five feet, seven inches to six feet, five inches).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aa7j5Z"&gt;Battery charges in about 3.5 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pKOXUB"&gt;Hydraulic disc brakes stop the bike with confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aGP1cI"&gt;The Cowboy app is one of the best in the business with its clean layout and features that make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeuHnX_ryH9mTqd85zXkixTV9FI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21906945/verge_DSC_1327_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CkBqI1"&gt;The Cowboy 3 is priced at €2,290 / £1,990 (about $2,665). That’s €300 more than both last year’s Cowboy 2 and VanMoof’s comparable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3 and X3 commuter e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But with a VanMoof, the price includes fenders, which are an €89 option from Cowboy, and a kickstand, which Cowboy doesn’t offer at all. At least Cowboy now ships its bikes with bells. Knowing that you’ll get a removable battery, free mobile repairs, and free crash detection helps make the Cowboy’s price tag a little easier to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wt5mMP"&gt;The third-generation Cowboy is available in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, the Netherlands, and the UK, with Denmark in the works. US sales will happen someday, but right now, the European e-bike market is ten times the US market, says Cowboy, so it’s not in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ngwl8Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt; Putting €33 million to good use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BBimIn"&gt;Cowboy’s clearly been busy putting the €33 million in funding it’s raised since 2018 to good use to add and improve features while maintaining a pace of slow and steady expansion. Cowboy 3 is an excellent electric bike, made better through a selection of free and subscription-based services that should add real value over the lifetime of the bike.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01KJr7"&gt;Still, I can’t help but think that it’s a little confused. The geometry puts the rider into a sporty riding position yet its top, pedal-assisted speed has been reduced by 17 percent from last year’s model. And it’s sold as a city commuter but lacks urban necessities that should be included as standard components. The Cowboy 3 reminds me of a college graduate, torn between the recklessness of youth and the stodgy demands of the corporate world, knowing that growing up is inescapable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iASjph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 18th, 8:08AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated review text after Cowboy rolled out new Manual Unlock procedure to start the Cowboy 3 without a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An all-black PS5 sure would go great with Sony’s new midnight black Pulse 3D headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D Audio headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_ezYJRE2tmhffdaQKzojqkaDL8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009976/pulse3dmidnightblack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YOaFts"&gt;Sony’s second colorway for the Pulse 3D headset for PS5 and PS4, clad in midnight black instead of white, is coming out this week. &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/pulse-3d-wireless-headset-midnight-black.3006397"&gt;It’s the same $99.99 price&lt;/a&gt; as before, and nothing is different about it that I’ve noticed, aside from the matte black headband. If you’re one for embracing dark mode in both your apps and devices, you probably know if you want this already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6QgSz"&gt;The Pulse 3D headset was made to be a technical showcase for Sony’s Tempest 3D audio engine built into the PS5 — and it is. At its cost, this model supplies better-than-average sound quality and good positional audio. Games made by PlayStation Studios, like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;, and others, seem to make the most of the 3D audio tech, so try those out if you’re looking for particularly impressive tech demos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWHP5D"&gt;The Pulse 3D is not the only headset that can do this (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;or even do it well&lt;/a&gt;), and you can even get passable results by using headphones you already own, plugged into your DualSense controller. But for people who want a solid wireless headset that charges via USB-C and doesn’t compromise on design, performance, or comfort (its silicone strap keeps the full weight of it from pressing down on your head), the Pulse 3D is an easy, somewhat affordable choice. And, now it comes in a svelte black.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/io2i6Y_oQz_jKlk-rZodvx5xvmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930311/midnightblackrange.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tDV3sw"&gt;As far as the button layout goes, it might take a while to learn, but I like what’s here. Along the edge of its left ear cup, it has a volume rocker and a rocker for adjusting the game and chat audio mix. You can turn mic monitoring on to hear your own voice coming through the mic, and there’s a mute button. In addition to working via 2.4GHz wirelessly via its included USB-A dongle, it includes a 3.5mm cable that you can use with the DualSense or any other device with a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPKTrd"&gt;Sony has been slower to introduce new colors of its headsets than for its DualSense controller, which got midnight black and crimson options a few months after the PS5 launched. But now, with a headset to possibly match your all-black controller, all that’s missing is for Sony to release swappable plates of its own for the PS5 to complete the set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxONhX"&gt;I’d be remiss not to take this opportunity to consider out loud that Sony has now made multiple colorways for its controller and its headset, yet not for its console’s replaceable shells. You know, the ones that you have to learn how to remove in order to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;add an M.2 drive to your PS5 for additional storage&lt;/a&gt;. I certainly wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to color coordinate my entire suite of PS5 goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDr2bi"&gt;It’s a puzzle to me why Sony hasn’t already released its own plates for the PS5, but things haven’t been totally quiet on that topic. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;dbrand shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it ended the sale of its Darkplates after Sony threatened to sue the company if it didn’t comply with a cease and desist order. This may or may not mean that Sony is about to release its own plates, but in the short term, it could mean that it may become tougher to find third-party alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFoJqY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Eg02fla5QNjKwnijgsV-r_Q5uk=/0x96:1088x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009811/apple_unleashed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5tZSlE"&gt;Apple is hosting its next big hardware event at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. The event is titled “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;,” and while we’re not totally sure what Apple will be unleashing, the dotted-font design on the invitation could be a hint at the higher-res &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590004/macbook-air-mini-led-display-apple-silicon-2022-redesign"&gt;miniLED displays&lt;/a&gt; expected for new MacBook Pros. These new, more powerful MacBook Pros will probably come in 14- and 16-inch screen sizes, and, may have SD readers and HDMI and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1FC9o"&gt;And possibly (finally) Apple may release new AirPods as well.  It also seems likely we’ll get a release date for macOS Monterey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;which was announced&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, but remains in beta. The rumor mill also has been predicting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;end of the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR1IjE"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “UNLEASHED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on Monday, October 18th. If you miss the live stream, it’s likely you’ll be able to catch a replay after the event wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream on its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also streaming it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exM1uajp--A&amp;amp;ab_channel=Apple"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded above for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Harry Potter smartwatch cashes in on millennial nostalgia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/us6_RqRLg9BWDCw7aB1SrPPGb4A=/0x0:1794x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009801/m_bgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AxLGmg"&gt;How much do you still like Harry Potter? Enough to put up with a device that our own Dan Siefert called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;basic and borin&lt;/a&gt;g” and which &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;’s Victoria Song called “&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-worst-smartwatch-ive-ever-used-1846652533"&gt;the worst smartwatch I’ve ever used”&lt;/a&gt;? Well boy do I have a limited edition tie-in for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cps0XJ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Foneplus-watch-harry-potter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732353%2Foneplus-harry-potter-limited-edition-smartwatch-watch-faces" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Watch Harry Potter Limited Edition&lt;/a&gt; is a new version of the company’s disappointing debut smartwatch themed around the boy wizard. It’s currently listed for ₹16,999 (around $225), and will be available exclusively in India. That’s a small premium over the ₹14,999 (around $200) the regular version of the watch retails for in the country. &lt;a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/wearables/news/oneplus-watch-harry-potter-limited-edition-price-in-india-rs-16999-launch-specifications-features-2579161"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NDTV &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the watch will go on general sale from October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7z7R_mnKc2Wbl9PRdA4xNs9goo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935324/watch_rotate_360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch includes custom faces and a Harry Potter-themed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NVTFw9"&gt;The limited edition version of the watch naturally includes a number of Harry Potter-themed elements. It has a copper color scheme and a brown leather band adorned with Harry Potter branding, and it comes in a box themed around the magical entryway to Diagon Alley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJJWQi"&gt;Software tweaks include six themed watch faces, including four based around the Hogwarts school houses, as well as special boot and charging animations. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-watch-harry-potter-edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; gotten its hands on the watch if you’d like to read some first-hand impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDRm1l"&gt;Despite its disappointing initial reviews, OnePlus has been updating the watch since its release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422707/oneplus-watch-always-on-display-update-battery-life"&gt;adding new features like&lt;/a&gt; an always-on display and remote control camera function. But based on Dan’s experience with the smartwatch, it might need a lot more than a wizarding-themed coat of paint to turn it into a must-have accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKo0j1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IdRDQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s Bluetooth speaker with Spotify Tap is also a lamp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blqp-t159_HajrcT-LKfLGreiAc=/18x0:1653x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009676/1_5_sec.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea’s Vappeby is one of the first Bluetooth speakers with a dedicated Spotify Tap button.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfZw0W"&gt;Ikea’s Vappeby Bluetooth speaker just leaked courtesy of an &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2004"&gt;FCC filing&lt;/a&gt;. And because it’s Ikea, this mushroom-shaped speaker with an IP65 rating — which means it’ll resist dust, rain, and low pressure jets of water — also features an integrated 20 lumen (2700K) bulb to pull double-duty as a portable lamp. But that’s not the only surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrbjfn"&gt;The Vappeby speaker also has a Spotify Tap button, in what would appear to be a first for Bluetooth speakers. Spotify Tap lets you resume your music from wherever you last stopped, or tap the button again to get a different recommendation tailored for you. Spotify Tap is already available on &lt;a href="https://explore.spotify.com/us/pages/spotify-tap"&gt;a range of Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt; from Samsung, Microsoft, Bose, Jabra, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_UzWvu9b33rmbtTHqKxS1stMdQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935288/Pasted_Graphic_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laptop for scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4mytxEe6Pg5nV_ZPR_bMHoRZio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935289/Pasted_Graphic_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let there be light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wMUtAS"&gt;The diminutive speaker that seems ideally suited for use in the garden or patio also has a USB-C port for charging, and a battery that Ikea says will last for up to 13 hours when set at 50 percent volume and brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7vYq"&gt;Note: the Vappeby isn’t part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22724889/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs"&gt;Symfonisk range&lt;/a&gt; of Sonos-developed speakers. It’ll sit next to Ikea’s other Bluetooth speakers which currently start at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Feneby-portable-bluetooth-speaker-black-20401407%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732334%2Fikea-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-vappeby-outdoor-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99&lt;/a&gt; and go up to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Feneby-bluetooth-speaker-black-gen-2-40492425%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732334%2Fikea-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-vappeby-outdoor-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no price or date for this portable, all-weather speaker, but it shouldn’t be long before it hits retail channels now that it’s cleared the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK schools are using facial recognition to take pupils’ lunch money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facial Recognition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZ5e23-ewOCItEvkj2nILzecKYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009630/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVWEFs"&gt;A group of nine schools in the UK have started using facial recognition to verify children’s payments for school meals. The schools in North Ayrshire in Scotland claim that using the technology is faster and more hygienic than taking payments using cards or fingerprint scanners, but privacy advocates warn that the move is normalizing biometric surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UC4My7"&gt;“With Facial Recognition, pupils simply select their meal, look at the camera and go, making for a faster lunch service whilst removing any contact at the point of sale,” reads a flyer &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-parental-flyer.pdf"&gt;distributed to parents&lt;/a&gt; by the schools. An &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-faqs.pdf"&gt;FAQ sheet&lt;/a&gt; says that children’s biometric data is stored in an encrypted form and deleted when a child leaves the school. Parents have to opt-in for children to use the technology, and can alternatively use PIN to verify payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k5n1aj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parents have to opt-in to use the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2NSWqR"&gt;David Swanston, managing director of CRB Cunninghams, the firm responsible for installing the technology, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/af08fe55-39f3-4894-9b2f-4115732395b9"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that facial recognition cut payment time per pupil to five seconds on average. Swanston said pilots of the system had begun in 2020, and that 65 more schools were signed up to introduce the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkr7zH"&gt;As reported by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, North Ayrshire council claims that 97 percent of children or parents consented to be enrolled. But some parents said they were not sure if children fully understood what they were signing up for, and were influenced by peer pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFCfuqBSjU-5VhO1mJYwu3VYvBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935274/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_9.49.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: North Ayrshire council&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaflet explaining the technology was distributed to parents ahead of the enrollment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qclLnV"&gt;Facial recognition systems of various types are becoming more common throughout the world. Schools in the United States have been installing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/20/21028124/schools-facial-recognition-mass-shootings"&gt;such systems for years&lt;/a&gt;, though usually as a security measure. Last week, Moscow &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;introduced facial recognition payments&lt;/a&gt; in its metro system, with activists warning that the technology could be used to track and identify protestors. Various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; in the US have banned facial recognition, arguing that the technology is frequently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;biased&lt;/a&gt; across racial or gender lines. In the European Union, too, politicians and advocacy groups are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-ban-facial-recognition-brussels/"&gt;calling for a ban on the technology&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the downsides of its introduction outweigh potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMJcCg"&gt;Silkie Carlo of the UK campaign group Big Brother Watch told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; that the Ayrshire school scheme was unnecessary. “It’s normalising biometric identity checks for something that is mundane,” said Carlo. “You don’t need to resort to airport style [technology] for children getting their lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 might start at a relatively affordable $599</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvuijt355hlT98Haqc5CtsMGe3U=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009616/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s1StdY"&gt;The Pixel 6’s price could start at $599 with 128GB of storage, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro could start at $898, according to early US pricing at Target stores spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678"&gt;M. Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EvanLei1/status/1449875442953949184"&gt;Evan Lei&lt;/a&gt;. Lei posted a photo of pricing already displayed on Target’s shelves, while Lee has images of the retailer’s inventory system showing the same prices. A “street date” for both phones (aka their release dates) is listed as October 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfvImM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0"&gt;Lee has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the European starting prices of the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro will be €649 and €899 respectively, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1449810859807608836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1449810859807608836%7Ctwgr%5Ehb_2_7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2021%2F10%2F17%2Fpixel-6-us-price%2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has discovered Amazon UK listings that show the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro priced at £849, with a shipping date of November 1st. The Pixel 6 Pro with 256GB of storage could cost £100 more at £949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xE8uCQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here are the corroborated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Pro&lt;/a&gt; prices in the Target inventory system in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pixel 6: $599&lt;br&gt;Pixel 6 Pro: $898&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google has to be subsidizing this phone like crazy. This is insanity. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OUBl8cXCBh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OUBl8cXCBh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2Dhq"&gt;If accurate, these prices are much more affordable than what we expected after Google said it was making an “ultra high end” smartphone in August. Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh even said that the new phone would “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;certainly be a premium-priced product&lt;/a&gt;,” which suggested pricing of over $1,000. Instead, these starting prices are cheaper than the midrange &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; that debuted for $699 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqI3wS"&gt;Google is poised to announce its latest smartphones at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;taking place on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones will be Google’s first to run its own Tensor processor, and could support face-unlock, up to 23W wireless fast charging via a new Pixel Stand, and come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a closer look at the phones ahead of their official launch, plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;images of the handset have leaked&lt;/a&gt; showing every aspect of their design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Beatles: Get Back, Narcos: Mexico, The Batman, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaoHt7O247YY9ceXTJ8Q83tHDPc=/170x0:1216x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70008384/the_beatles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beatles prepare for their final live show, part of a “new” documentary from Disney. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auta2lagtw4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WaltDisneyStudios" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIbAHx"&gt;Happy &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; day to all of us who are celebrating, the show returns tonight and I look forward to being welcomed back by the dissonant piano chords of its theme song and the utter lunacy of the Roy family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HACFgn"&gt;Yesterday at DC FanDome we got to see a slew of new trailers for games, TV shows, and movies; the biggest of course was the latest trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; teaser&lt;/a&gt; a close second. Plenty of non-superhero trailers this week as well, including a new teaser for &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, a new season for &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico, &lt;/em&gt;another peek at &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye, &lt;/em&gt;a time-traveling flick with a corny name, and a look at the “new” Beatles documentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIbzSf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Auta2lagtw4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5fL6tb"&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xRCAql"&gt;As the story goes, a film crew got access to document The Beatles at work in 1969, but the footage has been locked in a vault until now, and has been restored by filmmaker Peter Jackson (with the blessing of the surviving Beatles and their families). The group had three weeks to write and record a new album and it’s really fascinating to see the four of them work through what were half-written songs then, that we now know well, and argue over whether to do a live show. And as usual, Paul McCartney looks unbelievably young. It’s really poignant when you realize the film is leading up to what will be their last live performance, on a London rooftop. &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back, &lt;/em&gt;directed by Peter Jackson&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will roll out over three days —November 25th, 26th, and 27th— on Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w2d71w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyXUaNhqpqE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V9A1Pw"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yn8SKY"&gt;This second look at the Marvel/Disney series is really leaning in to the whole “this is a Christmas show” bit. Clint Barton/Hawkeye and the family head to New York to see a show: “Rogers, The Musical,” according to the marquee (we get a glimpse of Thor and Captain America on stage with a puzzled Clint in the audience). A one-minute teaser set to Andy Williams’ &lt;em&gt;Most Wonderful Time of the Year&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t tell us a whole lot more about the show, which is a little disappointing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, and Florence Pugh star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mSUvLo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=13&amp;amp;start=13" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6fn0wM"&gt;The Batman &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cFfyns"&gt;The second trailer for the Matt Reeves/Robert Pattinson version of the Dark Knight dropped during FanDome and it’s very moody and grim and has cool explosions and gunfire effects and rain, but I wished we could have seen a tiny bit more of Paul Dano’s serial killer Riddler (a far cry from the beloved but campy Frank Gorshin version). Colin Farrell is completely unrecognizable as the Penguin, and Zoe Kravitz is a mysterious, flirty Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Also I’m a little obsessed with the question mark in the Riddler’s latte (I realize it’s probably the work of an FX artist and not a barista, but still). After what feels like several hundred pandemic-related delays, &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; will arrive in theaters March 4th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F7yw0f"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlnLus7iqkI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=20&amp;amp;start=20" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8v9wdu"&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gXya3A"&gt;I need more, Apple, these short teasers are just not sufficient. “Whence is that knocking?!” asks Denzel Washington’s Macbeth. Just you wait, mister, shit is about to get &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Oh hi, Frances McDormand looking totally innocent as Lady Macbeth (ha not really). Directed by Joel Coen, &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters December 25th and on Apple Plus TV on January 14th. Hopefully we get a longer trailer between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6scBQ1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhZBDO0CKJo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="63W3W4"&gt;Narcos: Mexico &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zGmkb3"&gt;This is reportedly the final season for this excellent series about drug cartels, the third in the Mexico series and the sixth for the entire &lt;em&gt;Narcos&lt;/em&gt; franchise (multiverse?). A new generation of cartel leaders are battling for power; throw in some truth-seeking journalists and ethically flexible government agents, and you got yourself a show. &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico&lt;/em&gt; returns to Netflix for season three on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BAMlIZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OODneEUWUQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rR7vFs"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3hYYMZ"&gt;To my surprise, John Cena is delightful in this teaser for&lt;em&gt; Peacemaker, &lt;/em&gt;a series spun off from&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad. &lt;/em&gt;The series takes place after the events of the movie and gives some insight into Peacemaker’s origins. It looks goofy and fun, and all eight episodes of this first season were written by &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;director James Gunn, obviously a huge plus. Cena stars along with Steve Agee, Danielle Brooks, Robert Patrick, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, and Chukwudi Iwuji in Peacemaker, which debuts on HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciyHpa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VfPClAsIpg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="41IMqv"&gt;Needle in a Timestack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MMPkyj"&gt;A movie with stars this talented should have a better name. But &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack &lt;/em&gt;is based on the 1966 short story of the same name by Robert Silverberg, so we just gotta live with that title. The trailer itself looks not terrible: A blissfully happy married couple have their lives disrupted when her jealous ex goes back in time to change their lives so that the couple never meets. Leslie Odom, Jr., Cynthia Erivo, Freida Pinto, and Orlando Bloom star in &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack,&lt;/em&gt; which is in select theaters now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook disputes report that its AI can’t detect hate speech or violence consistently</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8QWfLq9FMdhLLc4isYNzTH1fMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70007498/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is disputing a report that says its artificial intelligence isn’t effective at detecting hate speech. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPtpoM"&gt;Facebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/"&gt;wrote in blog post&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that the prevalence of hate speech on the platform had dropped by 50 percent over the past three years, and that “a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress” was false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8mx45"&gt;“We don’t want to see hate on our platform, nor do our users or advertisers, and we are transparent about our work to remove it,” Rosen wrote. “What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect, our teams continually work to develop our systems, identify issues and build solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJJ8la"&gt;The post appeared to be in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184?st=fdxfcqdeo7a0g8a&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Sunday article in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the Facebook employees tasked with keeping offensive content off the platform don’t believe the company is able to reliably screen for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ2tTz"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report states that internal documents show that two years ago, Facebook reduced the time that human reviewers focused on hate speech complaints, and made other adjustments that reduced the number of complaints. That in turn helped create the appearance that Facebook’s artificial intelligence had been more successful in enforcing the company’s rules than it actually was, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbcLey"&gt;A team of Facebook employees found in March that the company’s automated systems were removing posts which generated between 3 and 5 percent of the views of hate speech on the social platform, and less than 1 percent of all content that was in violation of its rules against violence and incitement, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DXjt5"&gt;But Rosen argued that focusing on content removals alone was “the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech.” He says the technology to remove hate speech is just one method Facebook uses to fight it. “We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it,” Rosen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzZ4aK"&gt;Instead, he said, the company believes focusing on the prevalence of hate speech people actually see on the platform and how it reduces it using various tools is a more important measure. He claimed that for every 10,000 views of a piece of content on Facebook, there were five views of hate speech. “Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it,” Rosen wrote. “It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress, as it provides the most complete picture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sLsMO"&gt;But the internal documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; showed some significant pieces of content were able to evade Facebook’s detection, including videos of car crashes that showed people with graphic injuries, and violent threats against trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXO6As"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of reports about Facebook&lt;/a&gt; based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. She &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress &lt;/a&gt;that the company was aware of the negative impact its Instagram platform could have on teenagers. Facebook has disputed the reporting based on the internal documents. &lt;/p&gt;
