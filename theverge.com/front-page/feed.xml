    <title>These LED dice could electrify your next DnD campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCPNP7fXvDSm6mD5YVeP-olD1_4=/0x0:575x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954375/4bd809d32eab0a5b57fb7a635770f0b5_original.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dice are equipped with RGB lights and can communicate via Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Systemic Games / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/" target="_blank"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esToTz"&gt;Sometimes it’s nice to get away from technology for a bit, settle down with some friends, and play an entire role-playing game using just pen, paper, and lots of dice. But if that’s a little low-fi for you, then there’s always &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/"&gt;Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of electronic dice with built in Bluetooth and RGB LED lighting. The dice have launched on Kickstarter, with prices starting at $39. As of this writing, over 14,000 people have already backed the project for a total of over $2 million pledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NmClN"&gt;The main attraction here is obviously the colorful RGB lighting, which creator Systemic Games promises will be customizable and programmable via a companion app. The Pixels are also waterproof, charge wirelessly via companion charging cases, and can go for around five hours on a charge, or more if you’re willing to live without the lighting. A range of die styles are available, including D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5V5XEXRz5a8Ho0amjh3ZZoDHePI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365024/2tKpnK0BehxWS_wI2JARGQp0rY_D5oAmdLvANrmVhl4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Systemic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RGB lighting illuminates the dice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UALxwR"&gt;But for me, the most interesting thing about the dice is how they’ll apparently be able to communicate with Roll20, Foundry, and other online platforms that let you play tabletop games over the internet. At the moment a service like Roll20 relies on either virtual dice rolls, or rolling a traditional dice and then reporting back to your games master. In contrast, the Pixels could offer the best of both worlds, by letting you roll a physical die and automatically reporting the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgyML8"&gt;Yes, there are a lot of obvious jokes to be made about not being able to play a pen-and-paper RPG because your dice aren’t charged. But if you like the thought of having Bluetooth-enabled dice that light up like Christmas trees, then the Pixels are available to back on Kickstarter until April 8th. One die (including charger) starts at $39, or you can get a set of seven dice and a charging case for $199. All of the usual warnings about backing Kickstarters apply, but if all goes to plan the Pixels &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;ship in around 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Chrome 89 keeps your Mac cooler, and saves ‘significant memory’ on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_Qbv-BhNmDXkyxvfQK2gdsr3vY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954158/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WGWwQ1"&gt;Google has detailed the efficiency improvements it made with Chrome 89, the latest version of its browser released earlier this month. Depending on whether you’re using the browser on Windows, macOS, or Android, &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/advanced-memory-management-and-more.html"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; the browser should use less resources, launch quicker, and feel more responsive to use. There’s no mention of any improvements specifically for users on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKCGGw"&gt;The exact benefits vary by OS. Across platforms, Google says Chrome is able to reclaim as much as 100MiB (or over 20 percent on some sites) by using foreground tab memory more efficiently, and on macOS it’s saving up to 8 percent of its memory usage based on how it handles background tabs (something which Chrome already does on other platforms). Google says these improvements on macOS have benefited the browser’s Energy Impact score by as much as 65 percent, “keeping your Mac cooler and those fans quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AXUPsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Benefits vary by platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juPHtz"&gt;On Windows and Android, the browser is also using a more advanced memory allocator across more areas to further reduce memory usage, and increase browser responsiveness. On Windows, Google says it’s seeing “significant memory” savings of up to 22 percent in the “browser process,” 8 percent in the renderer, 3 percent in the GPU, and that overall browser responsiveness is improved by up to 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfkZj9"&gt;There are also a host of improvements specific to Android, which google says result in 5 percent less memory usage, fewer crashes, 7.5 percent faster startup, 2 percent faster page loads, and a 13 percent faster startup. High-end Android devices running on Android 10 and newer with at least 8GB of RAM should also load pages 8.5 percent faster, and be 28 percent smoother to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkvGUi"&gt;Google has made similar promises about previous Chrome releases. For example &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;it said Chrome 87&lt;/a&gt;, released at the end of last year, was “the largest gain in Chrome performance in years.” Under-the-hood performance improvements were said to improve everything from CPU usage, power efficiency, and startup times. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost a fifth of Facebook employees are now working on VR and AR: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGq5s7i3wdwj1cX2qiTydCgCAb4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954014/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0HJRLR"&gt;Facebook has nearly 10,000 employees in its division working on augmented reality and virtual reality devices, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-facebook-as-its-hardware-commerce-ambitions-expand"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on internal organizational data. The number means the Reality Labs division accounts for almost a fifth of the people working at Facebook worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7oIaw"&gt;This suggests that Facebook has been significantly accelerating its VR and AR efforts. As &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/5-percent-facebooks-employees-working-vrar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; noted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Oculus VR division accounted for over a thousand employees at a time when Facebook’s headcount was 18,770 overall, indicating a percentage somewhere north of five percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AQgLFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QXXlRR"&gt;Since then, Facebook has shifted its VR focus away from Oculus Rift-style tethered headsets by releasing the Oculus Quest and Quest 2, which are standalone wireless devices that don’t require a PC. The $299 Quest 2 was preordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg"&gt;five times as much as its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, with developers seeing a boost in sales of their existing titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04wIzA"&gt;“Today, most of what Facebook does is…we’re building on top of other people’s platforms,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; in an &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; this week on Facebook’s VR and AR ambitions. “I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform, this combination of augmented and virtual reality, to make sure that it develops in this way that is fundamentally about people being present with each other and coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Los Angeles movie-goers will soon be able to visit a theater for the first time in a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC movie theater logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnTzIzt6s_l3rW0m-52bhwY0pJ0=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952793/amc-movie-theater-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m7ej3k"&gt;Los Angeles theaters will be &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3014"&gt;allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity&lt;/a&gt; next week, according to the LA Department of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/la-movie-theaters-reopening-25-percent-capacity-1234928619/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The restrictions are being lifted, almost &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-movie-theaters-new-york-close-1203532292/"&gt;exactly a year after&lt;/a&gt; they were put in place, because Los Angeles County believes it will reach the number of vaccinations required by California to move into the next phase of reopening. The movie capitol’s theater re-opening comes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295880/new-york-city-movie-theaters-open-cuomo"&gt;a few weeks after New York’s&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that two of the biggest movie markets will once again be uncapping their projectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaPK2"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes, this doesn’t mean that the theaters will be able to open as soon as the ban lifts — they’ve been closed for so long that they’ll have to re-hire and train staff, which could take a week or two. The theaters will also have to ensure that they can meet the safety and cleaning requirements required by California, and will have to set up a reservation system if they don’t already have one — any theater reopening will be required to have moviegoers book their seats in advance. Attendees will also be required to wear masks, and groups will have to be at least six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tila7y"&gt;Theaters will also have to figure out which movies to show (a somewhat important part of the moviegoing experience), as most major releases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;have been pushed back to the second half of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFbaN"&gt;The future was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504536/movie-theaters-close-regal-cineworld-amc-cinemark"&gt;looking grim for movie theaters back in October&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500538/regal-cineworld-theaters-shut-down-james-bond-us-uk"&gt;theater chains shutting down all their locations&lt;/a&gt; in the US and UK, some permanently. The picture has been looking brighter since then, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;arrival of the vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324053/amc-theaters-earnings-fourth-quarter-stock-movies-vaccine-streaming"&gt;AMC said yesterday that it believes it’ll be able to weather the storm&lt;/a&gt; until most Americans are able to see movies again. Whether the public will rush back to movie theaters remains to be seen, as some of the year’s most anticipated films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;will be released side-by-side on streaming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden: ‘all American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Address To Nation On Covid-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqhh3o_h12KCo8lv8vfpuWEqzSg=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952717/1231655585.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXHuzy"&gt;President Joe Biden just announced that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations by May 1st. He also said that the federal government will launch a website on May 1st that will let people check where they can get a vaccine near them. He made both announcements during his first prime-time televised address as President on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxvMFb"&gt;“All American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st,” says Biden. “That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately. But it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6asIdq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jM5Q0n"&gt;The administration also plans to increase the number of places administering vaccinations and expand the group of medical professionals who can give the shots. All these steps should help states get shots in arms, increasing the likelihood that the country will hit its vaccination targets, and return to something resembling normalcy. The US will have enough doses available to vaccinate every adult in the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316094/covid-19-vaccine-supplies-us-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;by the end of May.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxpThf"&gt;Biden says the goal is for families to be able to celebrate together again by the Fourth of July, but made no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IUgN3Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="picIxx"&gt;This isn’t the first time a US president has promised a large-scale website as part of its efforts to fight COVID-19. In March 2020, as the nation was coming to terms with the fast-spreading virus, former president Donald Trump announced that Google had 1,700 engineers working on a nationwide website that people could use to determine if they should get tested and where they could do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ifUO0"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;wasn’t true&lt;/a&gt;, however — Verily, another company owned by Google parent Alphabet, was in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19"&gt;the early stages&lt;/a&gt; on a testing website that was intended to serve parts of California. And that 1,700 number reportedly came from a list of Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-google-coronavirus.html"&gt;who said they would volunteer&lt;/a&gt; for the project. Trump’s promised website never launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzzQs1"&gt;Biden also said that his administration will deploy teams to help states in need of support for their own vaccine-scheduling websites. The government will also establish a call center to help &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/11/us/joe-biden-news#in-his-prime-time-speech-biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adult-americans-eligible-for-vaccine-by-may-1"&gt;people without internet access&lt;/a&gt; make a vaccine appointment. The announcements follow Biden’s signing of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/stimulus-bill-covid-19-passes-house"&gt;earlier on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for many Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7AIOU"&gt;Vaccines are slowly becoming more available in the US, but it is still a challenge for many to get them or even book an appointment. That has led to the homegrown development of services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;Dr. B&lt;/a&gt;, which notifies people about thawed vaccines that would otherwise go to waste, and &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt;, which can help people book vaccine appointments in the NYC area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/vaccinefinder/about.html"&gt;vaccine finder website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neaCKi"&gt;If you’re looking to score a vaccine appointment ahead of May 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20ZcnH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"},{"title":"Meet Dr. B, the startup promising a better way to distribute leftover vaccines","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SbPam4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ‘culture fit’ is the focus of a discrimination complaint, report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZO9S4xs2UARQy9XgLuVb-1ibRyw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952281/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5Kywb"&gt;A Black woman who interviewed at Facebook last year says she was told the company was “looking for a culture fit” before being rejected, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/11/facebook-hiring-racism-eeoc/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; She’s now one of four people who’ve recently complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about allegedly racist hiring and promotion practices at the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="002qf0"&gt;The woman says she was well-suited to the managerial position on Facebook’s Global Impact Partnerships team due to her work experience and relevant doctoral degree, &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports. Yet she alleged that during in-person meetings, she “sensed that the interviewers were not prioritizing her interviews because all of the interviews seemed rushed after making her wait for several hours.” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;agreed not to use the woman’s real name as a condition of receiving the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWIcI7"&gt;All the interviewers were white,&lt;em&gt; The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reports. Only 3.9 percent of Facebook’s US workforce is Black, &lt;a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/"&gt;according to a recent diversity report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzlsJy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of an EEOC investigation into allegations of racial bias in Facebook’s hiring and promotion processes. The probe has been categorized as “systemic,” meaning the agency “suspects” these policies “may be contributing to widespread discrimination,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNzk6d"&gt;The woman also alleged that one Facebook staffer told her “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit.” The term is widely used in the tech industry to refer to job applicants who staffers would want to have a beer with. But experts say it’s a “misguided hiring strategy” that can contribute to a lack of diversity, “since very often the people we enjoy hanging out with have backgrounds much like our own,” &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-hire"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcrBmB"&gt;The complaint alleges that the company’s discrimination against Black applicants is partly predicated on its “strong consideration of ‘culture fit’ in hiring, without providing sufficient objective guidance to managers and other employees on how to determine which applicants and employees will be a good ‘culture fit’ at Facebook,” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfCb7B"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4SObh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says the latest Xbox Series X update fixes controller disconnect issues</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfJ7O76VTZRgrZIjR96rgiRN8VI=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952172/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3616_2_4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x4lfJQ"&gt;Microsoft released a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/march-xbox-update-details/"&gt;new Xbox update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that brings toggles for Auto HDR and FPS Boost and improvements to better support the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big feature that wasn’t mentioned in the official release notes: the update also fixes “many” of the Xbox Series X controller disconnect issues that have cropped up, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298"&gt;according to the Xbox team’s Jason Ronald&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKXYNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lots of Xbox news this week, but in case you missed it we released our March Xbox System Update yesterday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the new features, this release also fixes many of the controller disconnects players have reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep the feedback coming.&lt;a href="https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty"&gt;https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Ronald (@jronald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwj24H"&gt;Players began reporting disconnect issues with the controllers just days after the console’s launch, and you can see some of those reports in this &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;89-page thread on Microsoft’s support forums&lt;/a&gt;. In January, however, Microsoft acknowledged that it was aware of the issues and said that fixes were coming “in a future update” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215289/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-disconnect-update"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CE9M9E"&gt;We haven’t tested the new update ourselves to see if it fixes issues that people have seen. But if you have been experiencing controller disconnects, it sounds like the new update could address them for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Windows 10 update could cause your printer to crash your PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook Flip in tent mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dk7W1R8uGR4Ac9sRble8LgL2MQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952061/mchin_181225_4219_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mh23p0"&gt;The latest Windows update has been causing problems for some printer owners, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/03/10/windows-10-kb5000802-march-update-is-crashing-pcs-with-bsod/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Latest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/latest-windows-10-update-is-causing-some-printers-to-cr-1846456254"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Users are reporting that they’re getting a blue screen when they try to open the print dialogue from Notepad, Office, or other programs. (You know that annoyingly ambiguous error message that’s like “Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart”? It’s that one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZVBOV"&gt;Microsoft is aware that attempting to print in certain circumstances can blue screen your PC, and has listed the bug on the Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-9-2021-kb5000802-os-builds-19041-867-and-19042-867-63552d64-fe44-4132-8813-ef56d3626e14"&gt;Support page&lt;/a&gt;. The company doesn’t appear to have issued a fix at this time. “We are presently investigating and will provide an update when more information is available,” that website currently reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UThk2e"&gt;It’s not clear how widespread the issue is, but &lt;em&gt;Windows Latest&lt;/em&gt; says it has “seen numerous reports of error popping up here and there.” The bug appears to impact multiple printer brands including Kyocera, Ricoh, and Zebra. “Have had at least 20 confirmed cases from 4 different clients already and it’s only been an hour into the day,” one reader told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pN63MF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve seen numerous reports of error popping up here and there”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kp6OBC"&gt;Windows users are complaining across Reddit as well. “This issue was confirmed across four computers,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/"&gt;one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt;. “We just got 3 calls from clients all experiencing this same issue,” another commenter &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/gqgi31f?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Kyocera Corp. Founder Kazuo Inamori Interview" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g9XgY_cO-S2kVrbw5rppfGf8nDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363896/495767146.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LqvQNT"&gt;If you’re encountering this problem, the easiest fix is to roll back the latest Windows update. To do this, open Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update &amp;gt; View Update History &amp;gt; Uninstall Updates &amp;gt; Uninstall, or remove the patch manually in Command Prompt. Some Reddit users confirmed that this fixed their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQEGOd"&gt;A user claiming to be a Microsoft employee has also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m1jkuz/kyocera_drivers_patch_tuesday_bsod/gqj91b3/"&gt;posted two temporary workarounds&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit, which commenters have confirmed to work. You can enable direct printing in the Command Prompt, or you can use the Compatibility Administrator tool to apply a fix, depending on the application you’re running. Both processes are complicated, so your best bet is to go read that Reddit comment closely if you want to try them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s long-promised 5G home broadband will launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSH8vXRo5Bmuw4wCC_DHyAtOB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951865/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile hopes to expand the service to 7 to 8 million customers in the next five years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go listen to Spotify’s podcast about itself that ignores the existence of iTunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIvgSm29-LauAgtAIsyOvUcNsoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951861/mdoying_180308_1437_0082still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L1vT9P"&gt;Spotify is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-11/introducing-the-new-miniseries-spotify-a-product-story/"&gt;making a podcast about its own history&lt;/a&gt;, and the first two episodes are well worth a listen for the details on the jump from piracy to streaming, how the company decided to build its business, and the technical details of how it did so. There are also some fun interviews included, with the podcast featuring stories from Sean Parker, inventor of Napster, and Lars Ulrich of Metallica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjakdV"&gt;In the podcast, the Spotify founders discuss the history of piracy in Spotify’s home country, Sweden, to give context about its development environment. It goes into the existence of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Sweden)"&gt;Sweden’s Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;, an actual political party that once held several seats in the country’s parliament. The founders also discuss how they wanted to take the ease of pirating music but make it legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hto6JX"&gt;If talk about being easier than piracy sounds familiar, it’s probably because that was part of the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theledger.com/news/20130424/happy-anniversary-itunes-celebrates-a-decade-faces-new-challenges"&gt;iTunes Music Store, too&lt;/a&gt;. It seems, for the most part, that iTunes and the iPod are pretty much completely ignored. The podcast presents music distribution as going from CD stores to Napster to Spotify. Apple and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18268861/spotify-apple-antitrust-fight-latest-updates-news"&gt;aren’t the best of friends&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s honestly somewhat hilarious to hear how the story completely ignores the fact that people could, in fact, buy digital music (an option that was around even before Spotify launched).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHyG4f"&gt;Despite the lack of objectivity about the history of digital music, the technical depth alone makes it well worth a listen. The second episode (labeled 01) gets into how Spotify used the same peer-to-peer tech used by the pirates to build its legitimate music streaming service and how its approach blew people's minds at the time. Even though the story leaves some pretty important parts out, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3L9tzrt0CthF6hNkxYIeSB"&gt;it’s still worth a listen&lt;/a&gt; to hear the origins of the popular music (and, obviously, podcasting) service. &lt;/p&gt;
