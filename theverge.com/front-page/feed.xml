  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-931" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage at Amazon for $320 ($9 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt; (in stock on April 4th), which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-634" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as $385 at Amazon (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; in gold only.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PSFYBw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WfS02T"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Air (2020) review|96393" data-volume-uuid="6c97cb5b6" data-volume-id="96393" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-703" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $530, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors on sale&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from $549 to $565 depending on the color you select. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Rose-Gold%2F149437127%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-461" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;. You can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BD9FH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,049&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon in silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399&lt;/a&gt; in both colors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DyhcNt"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFo3y1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatepa.org/"&gt;VaccinatePA&lt;/a&gt; uses a team of volunteers to call hospitals and pharmacies for information on where appointments are available, where you can get on a waitlist, and whom to contact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated toward helping people find COVID vaccinations. Currently, VaccineFinder is only available for people in Alaska, Tennessee, Indiana, and Iowa, but according to the site, it should be adding more providers in other states over the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Milla Jovovich wanted Monster Hunter viewers to feel ‘like they were playing the game for the first time’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWkAy71AyAj1DJFfbmSSmOcfHpU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890686/MH_00812_2000x1333_thumbnail.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: Coco Van Oppens Photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuDTrj"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, Milla Jovovich plays an outsider. Her character, a US Army ranger named Artemis, is mysteriously transported from our world to a fantastical realm filled with giant and dangerous monsters. American soldiers aren’t something you’ll find in any of Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games. But Jovovich believes Artemis helped provide an important perspective — almost serving as a stand-in for a player jumping into their first experience with a &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqDXdu"&gt;“When my character gets transported into the &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; world I was able to see it with the same eyes as when I first saw the game,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I was just like ‘Whoa, it’s so beautiful.’ We really wanted people to feel like that when they watch the movie, like they were playing the game for the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGKpKC"&gt;Jovovich says she was introduced to the franchise through her husband, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; director Paul W.S. Anderson, who “had been really obsessed with this property for over 10 years.” Eventually he got the rights to the franchise, and went through a few iterations of a script. But it wasn’t until rewriting the story to have Jovovich as the lead that things really clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nIQIuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I really liked the dual blades.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1e5wF"&gt;There was also something about the fictional universe that spoke to her. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a typical kaiju story with giant creatures destroying the world. You wouldn’t mistake it for Godzilla. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16955336/monster-hunter-world-creature-design-interview"&gt;it’s about a place where humanity is deeply invested in the natural world around them&lt;/a&gt;. In the games, you don’t just hunt monsters to kill them; you use them to craft food, weapons, and other items. It’s all about survival, and it gives Monster Hunter its own distinct vibe compared to other action games, with slow, methodical gameplay based on careful planning and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8m712"&gt;“I really like that feeling of having to use every part of the animal, and there’s no waste,” Jovovich says. There are even scenes in the film where downed monsters are put to good use, just like in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rlE2c4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqQVtMbbTOM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W4sbG"&gt;She says she was able to better understand this aspect of the universe by playing&lt;em&gt; Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;. This experience also helped inform her character’s fighting style. In the movie, Artemis joins forces with a local hunter, played by Tony Jaa, and the two have very different techniques. Jaa wields a massive glaive, whereas Artemis eventually adopts a pair of twin blades (which at one point are lit on fire). “I really liked the dual blades, and there are certain moves that go with the dual blades that we wanted to film,” she explains. But those two distinct fighting styles weren’t the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okyLA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re always going to have to make certain sacrifices.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvQ1m0"&gt;“I felt at the beginning like our fighting styles were too similar, in the sense that the choreographer was giving me some really cool-looking moves, but they just felt too film martial artsy,” Jovovich says. “I was like, I just feel like my character wouldn’t be able to do a butterfly kick. That’s not her training. Her training as a soldier would be much more close-combat … Whereas the martial arts that Tony does is so much more cinematic and beautiful. I felt like it was good to let him do that stuff, and then for us to have very different fighting styles. Because it’s more realistic, but also I thought it was more interesting for our characters as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIxK0415-rEeB6EvCJbWHsVO1aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330618/Monster_Hunter_LP_Clean_Clip_144_2000x825_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AcuJDo"&gt;Adapting an existing property is always a tricky proposition. Fans come with preconceived expectations, and it can be tough to meet those while also making things accessible for new audiences. It’s something that Jovovich and Anderson are experienced with, having worked together on the long-running &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series, which also happens to be based on a Capcom game. The new movie provided a slightly different challenge. Since the release of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019"&gt;the franchise is as popular as it’s ever been&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still not exactly a household name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eVoGz"&gt;“When you’re dealing with a 90 minute version of something, you’re always going to have to make certain sacrifices,” she explains. “If this was &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; the TV show, it would be very different. You would have a lot more time to spend on little details. The most important thing for us when making a movie was to have the spirit of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSIabH"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Monster Hunter &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available to purchase digitally now and will be out on Blu-Ray and DVD starting March 2nd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 review: premium in the right ways</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Samsung’s flagship Chromebook is less expensive and better than before&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IBTWQf"&gt;I’ll spare you the suspense: the battery life is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0Pbj7"&gt;It’s not incredible. The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 is far from the longest-lasting Chromebook I’ve ever tested. But after last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t even make it five hours on a charge, my expectations were on the floor. I performed my first battery test on this year’s sequel in an optimistic but nervous state. Finally, several months after the Chromebook 2 was announced, I’m breathing a sigh of relief. To repeat: the battery life is not a disaster, folks. The battery life is fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HJwOP"&gt;That’s sort of the theme of this machine. There are a couple of standout features, and the rest of it is fine. And I’m very happy with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mXmY6v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10361777"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17F6KY"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook, released almost a year ago, was a high-risk, high-reward play. There were a number of fantastic features, some of which (the OLED screen, the built-in S Pen, the 0.38-inch-thick chassis) were so fancy it was shocking to see them on a Chromebook. But two of its features were significant problems: the $999 price tag (putting the device in competition with the likes of the MacBook Air), and the battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPwcSZ"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 (which isn’t so much a sequel to the Galaxy Chromebook as it is a more affordable alternative) lacks some of the Galaxy Chromebook’s most ambitious features. The stylus, the fingerprint sensor, and the OLED panel have all disappeared. But in their place are all-day battery life and a sub-$700 price tag. In doing so, it makes its case not as a groundbreaking Chromebook of the future, but as a device you might actually want to buy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 seen from above and to the right.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With colors like these, who needs OLED?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The three ports on the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uiCDakitE-qQZMHF9oFlyPPslLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333699/akrales_210226_4438_0147.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, microSD, audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The USB-C port on the right side of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhhcJ9nAaAVFbvvQjgg3hJQgqyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333697/akrales_210226_4438_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, have another USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dmj8R0"&gt;From afar, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 looks fairly similar to the Galaxy Chromebook. That’s a compliment — the Galaxy Chromebook’s striking design was one of its biggest selling points. The Chromebook 2 comes in a bold “fiesta red” color, which is a cross between bright red and bright orange. You certainly don’t see Chromebooks of this hue every day, and it’ll turn heads if you’re sitting in public. (You can also buy this in “mercury gray” if you’re boring.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZOJ4x"&gt;Pick the thing up, and you’ll start to see where Samsung has cut some corners. It’s thicker and heavier than its predecessor, at 0.55 inches thick and 2.71 pounds, respectively. It’s still plenty light, though it’s a bit hefty to hold as a tablet for long periods. With square edges, it also has a blockier vibe, and the finish feels a bit plasticky and is quite a fingerprint magnet (though the prints are easy to wipe off if you have a cloth on hand). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ct2Rsa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10361787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hlMzwe"&gt;None of these changes are massive knocks against the Galaxy Chromebook 2, though, especially at this price point. It still looks quite nice, and the aluminum chassis is sturdy. There’s little to no flex in the display or keyboard, and while I saw a bit of screen wobble while typing and using the touchscreen, it wasn’t too distracting. This is where the Chromebook 2 has an advantage over our current top pick, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. That device is bulkier than Samsung’s, quite bland in its design, and has a bit more flex in its keyboard and screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0p3EOI"&gt;The really big chassis downgrade Samsung has made is in the display. The Galaxy Chromebook has a 4K OLED panel that’s absolutely beautiful but, to be honest, not necessary for the majority of people. Instead, the Chromebook 2 is the first Chromebook ever to feature a QLED panel. QLED panels aren’t OLED, despite the name similarity; they’re LED-backlit LCD screens that use Samsung’s quantum-dot technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvhGgH"&gt;But OLED or not OLED, this is still one of the best displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. It’s gorgeous. Colors were vibrant and accurate, with solid contrast and fine details. This machine is great to watch videos on. It is glossy and kicks back some glare but nothing that was too distracting. The other disappointment is that it’s 16:9 (1920 x 1080 resolution). The Chromebook Spin 713 also has a very nice panel at the roomier 3:2 aspect ratio. But on the whole, the Chromebook 2 looks great. Its speakers sound quite good as well, making for a solid entertainment device all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYjjC4"&gt;I’ll admit that the keyboard took some getting used to. It’s flatter than some of the best Chromebook keyboards I’ve used, including that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. But it does have a nice key texture with a click that’s satisfying but not too loud. I was enjoying it after a few days into my testing. In terms of ports, you get two USB-C ports (one on each side — bonus points for convenient charging!), a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. The one thing I’d wish for is a USB-A, but I know I’m fighting a losing battle there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="273gus"&gt;As I noted before, the Chromebook 2 is missing some of the snazzier features you’ll see on more expensive devices (including the Galaxy Chromebook). The most significant is that there’s no biometric authentication on this; it’s password-only, and I do miss the convenience of the fingerprint reader on its predecessor. (If you’re super anti-password, you could, technically, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9617782?hl=en"&gt;pair the Chromebook to an Android phone&lt;/a&gt; and unlock it with that phone’s biometrics.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="979RtV"&gt;Another thing you don’t get is a bundled stylus. The Galaxy Chromebook shipped with a nice pen, which lived in a tiny garage in the chassis. The Chromebook 2 is compatible with USI pens, but you’ll have to store them separately. And there’s no camera on the keyboard deck, something a number of recent Chromebooks have included to allow for easy front-facing photos while in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCCDbi"&gt;But while those features are all nice bonuses, they likely won’t impact the average user’s experience &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much. And at the $549 to $699 price points, I’m not enraged by their absence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hinge, part of the screen, and part of the Galaxy Chromebook 2 laid flat, seen from above" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACtGYLUGchSPkrqJHqBHQDuGDME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333702/akrales_210226_4438_0208.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty chassis with no stylus garage in sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KBpg73"&gt;You can buy the Galaxy Chromebook 2 with one of two processors: the starting $549.99 configuration includes an Intel Celeron 5205U with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and the $699.99 model (which I received) includes a Core i3-10110U, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 in tent mode, angled to the right, with the screen facing the camera. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEwKi2HgMTBRQRTanFuZ7b68MVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333701/akrales_210226_4438_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it as a clamshell, a tablet, or a tent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 in tent mode with the screen facing the camera, displaying The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MlsPe6vgTrRZoHnvDAes7ZrTXKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333703/akrales_210226_4438_0232.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hinge is a bit stiff. It’s not totally smooth to flip the thing around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epzcxL"&gt;In my first hands-on with this device, I was hesitant about the base configuration. Despite the appealing price, a Celeron with 4GB of RAM is quite an entry-level system, and I generally wouldn’t recommend it for anyone who needs their device to do school or office work. However, I now think there’s one compelling use case for the Celeron model: a Netflix machine. If you don’t plan on using the Galaxy Chromebook 2 as a primary driver but want to take advantage of the QLED screen for entertainment, you can probably get away with the $549 price. (Everyone else should probably spring for the Core i3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="wZrAvk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10361811"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpiQor"&gt;The Core i3 is a step down from the Core i5, the processor that powered the Galaxy Chromebook. But like an OLED screen, that processor is overkill for many Chrome OS tasks. As I used the Chromebook 2 to send emails, fiddle with spreadsheets, write in Google Docs, stream Spotify, and do other standard work, I didn’t notice any performance issues. I also never felt any heat in the keyboard, the touchpad, or the bottom of the deck. (The Galaxy Chromebook 2 has a fan, which some thin Chromebooks don’t.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM99jp"&gt;Battery life, as mentioned, is quite acceptable. I averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work at 50 percent brightness, sometimes using a mix of Chrome and Android apps and sometimes sticking mostly to Chrome. The Chromebook 2 does take a bit of time to charge, though. It only juiced up to 54 percent in an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6z8FF"&gt;Where the system lagged was in tasks that leverage the internal storage. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 has eMMC storage, which is considerably slower than the SSD you’ll find in most laptops. The process of getting a batch of around 100 photos from a camera into Adobe Lightroom just dragged. It took so long that, several times, I considered aborting the mission and hopping over to my MacBook. I ran AndroBench to confirm that the storage was the issue, and the results were... not great. To be clear, eMMC isn’t a huge knock against a Chromebook at this price, but it is a spec I’d stay away from if you’ll need to do anything with photos or other tasks that involve writing files to the drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 seen from above. A mug sits to its left on the desk, two pens and a ruler to its right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uymhWmmLoLnfzwyai8qct2g0WRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333692/akrales_210226_4438_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great for lighter loads, meh for more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cZCWi7"&gt;Finally, I think this is my first Chromebook testing period where I haven’t run into any big hiccups with Chrome OS. The operating system itself has been smooth for a while, but I’ve run into all kinds of issues with Android apps (one of the OS’s big selling points) in the past. No major problems here, though: nothing crashed, nothing bricked the device, nothing randomly changed size, nothing disappeared during tablet-mode transitions. That’s a welcome relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbrhsF"&gt;Your experience with Android apps on the Galaxy Chromebook 2 will vary widely based on the app. I generally used them to keep distractions like Twitter separate from my browser where I was working. Some popular services, such as Podcast Addict and 1Weather, don’t have great browser equivalents, so it’s handy to be able to load those apps through Chrome OS. But on net, I found that the apps I used for stuff every day — Slack, Messenger, Google Docs, Reddit, Twitter, Gmail — were either equivalent to or worse than their browser counterparts. The Android interfaces were generally slower to update and still had some kinks to work out. (You can’t click and drag to highlight in Docs, for example.) Slack also wouldn’t let me clear my status icon and occasionally sent me multiple pings for the same message. And Facebook Messenger occasionally refused to minimize, and also sent me huge dumps of notifications each morning from conversations I’d had on my phone the previous night. If you run into issues with Android apps, you can use the web app versions, which mostly work great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Npuqhc"&gt;In comparing the Chromebook 2 to the market, the most prominent competitor that comes to mind is Google’s Pixelbook Go. It offers similar benefits (an attractive design, decent battery life, a portable build) with similar caveats (no biometric authentication, no built-in stylus). But as of this writing, the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixelbook_go"&gt;$649 Pixelbook Go configuration&lt;/a&gt; comes with only 64GB of storage and an older Core m3 chip. So while there are reasons certain folks might prefer Google’s device (it has a better keyboard, it’s thinner and lighter), I think the $699 Galaxy Chromebook 2 is the better value among the two. For just $50 more, you get a better processor, more storage and RAM, a brilliant color, a convertible build, and a spectacular screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 on a desk in front of a window, open with a mug and small plant on its left and some books on its right. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QsyRgADs01k-6DRM01-GTQq-V2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333694/akrales_210226_4438_0085.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A $549 Chromebook that looks like a thousand bucks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5oNF7"&gt;A more difficult comparison is the convertible Chromebook Spin 713. For &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-2-VertiView-i5-10210U/dp/B08DTJC9N7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 less,&lt;/a&gt; you can get that system with a Core i5, an NVMe SSD, a better port selection that includes USB-A and HDMI, and a 3:2 screen that’s also excellent. On the whole, Acer’s device still offers better value for the average person. That said, there’s a valid reason some people may want to splurge on the Galaxy: looks. The Spin 713, like a number of Chromebooks that are great on the inside, looks like something that you’d see on a middle school laptop cart. Pared-down as it is, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is still a Samsung device: it asks a premium for hardware that’s beautiful to look at and built to last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8zrQuj"&gt;Put the Galaxy Chromebook 2 next to the Galaxy Chromebook, and the former has clearly cut some corners. But it’s cut the right corners. In some ways, it’s the device I’d hoped the Galaxy Chromebook would be: beautiful, bold, and totally functional as well. It’s exchanged a bit of panache for a lot of simplicity. It’s, as I said in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;my hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, “a regular-ass Chromebook.” And I couldn’t be happier with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O12Ms0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus teases ‘moonshot’ announcement for March 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Xno249q3aytutMWFumC0Z21Xqo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890549/EvZGXbPUYAEGwSM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teaser image for the March 8th event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AxgVb"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau is teasing a “moonshot” announcement on March 8th, when the company expected to reveal details about its next flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 9. “Something new is on the horizon” a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Fmoonshot&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22306934%2Foneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;teaser site reads&lt;/a&gt;, alongside a photograph that looks an awful lot like the famous “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;Earthrise&lt;/a&gt;” photograph from the Apollo 8 mission. That photo was taken with a Hasselblad camera, the 180-year-old Swedish company rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;partnering with OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; on its upcoming phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rdIV9"&gt;In the past, manufacturers have also used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18232998/huawei-p30-pro-quad-camera-leica-specs-features"&gt;photographs of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to advertise the capabilities of their phones’ zoom cameras for astrophotography, indicating that this could be a key feature of the OnePlus 9 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR7Onq"&gt;The tease comes days after tipster Ishan Agarwal &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-9-pro-9r-watch-march-launch-exclusive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be announcing three new smartphones — the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9R — and a smartwatch in mid-March. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1366308703562059785"&gt;tipster Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;, the company will announce the launch date of the OnePlus 9 series on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OuSSii"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stay tuned for March 8.&lt;a href="https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS"&gt;https://t.co/mprr4v8UbS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CQSop6Fg85"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CQSop6Fg85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1366357664213528576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTtPun"&gt;Other rumors about the upcoming OnePlus 9 Pro include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;wireless fast charging at 45W&lt;/a&gt;. The step-down OnePlus 9 is expected to have a flat 6.55-inch 120Hz 1080p display, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the 9 Pro will reportedly have a 6.78-inch 120Hz 1440p display. Both phones are expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor. A third phone, rumored to be called either the OnePlus 9R or OnePlus 9 Lite, could also be announced with an older Snapdragon 865 processor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US drone firm Skydio valued at $1 billion as government freezes out Chinese competition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UY9M8zaiuVtP3oqeLCPtTQw0obQ=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890180/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s X2 drone is aimed at enterprise and military customers. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmacCe"&gt;Skydio has become the first US dronemaker with a valuation of more than $1 billion, a signal of deeper investment in American-made drones after the US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; Chinese manufacturers. The California-based Skydio raised $170 million in a Series D funding round led by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/113c6e36-c91d-49d4-8a70-c4ab8da9bf09?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w67rOX"&gt;Skydio’s drones are best known for their self-flying tech, which allows the aircraft to autonomously navigate obstacles and track users on the ground. The company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17195622/skydio-r1-review-autonomous-drone-ai-autopilot-dji-competitor"&gt;its first drone&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, the $2500 R1, aiming the product at consumers. It followed this up with the smarter and much cheaper $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892377/skydio-2-drone-autonomous-self-flying-camera-controller-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;Skydio 2 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and last year announced its first drone aimed specifically at enterprise and military customers: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;the X2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPvB7J"&gt;Putting new emphasis on enterprise products makes sense given that the sector is the &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drone-industry-analysis-market-trends-growth-forecasts?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;fastest-growing&lt;/a&gt; in the drone market. Data gathered by Valuates Reports, and reported &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/113c6e36-c91d-49d4-8a70-c4ab8da9bf09?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says the global market for commercial drones will grow from $6.5 billion in 2020 to $35 billion in 2026. As well as opportunities in areas like construction and surveying, where self-flying drones can be used to map terrain and buildings with minimal pilot training, the US government is also set to be a big future customer for firms like Skydio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYunuOu0nL075I-iQ9iphOuGbxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21941965/skydio_2_bridge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s self-flying tech makes its drones easy to use for surveying jobs in markets like construction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zERSqr"&gt;After the US Armed Forces, Pentagon, and Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940921/us-interior-department-drone-grounding-china-spying-cybersecurity-risk"&gt;grounded&lt;/a&gt; drones with Chinese components over espionage fears, there have been new opportunities for American competitors. Although Chinese drone giant DJI still dominates consumer sales, with an estimated 70 percent market share, it can no longer sell to US government clients. DJI’s clout in the sector, though, has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16871848/gopro-drone-failure-3dr-dji-american-market"&gt;contributed to the demise&lt;/a&gt; of US firms like GoPro and 3D Robotics, which abandoned consumer sales over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFFP5F"&gt;Skydio’s X2 drone, which comes with integrated thermal camera and enterprise-grade controller, looks set to fill this new gap in the market. The X2 is already likely to be an official US Army drone after making it to the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sjydio+x2+arm+reconaissnace&amp;amp;oq=sjydio+x2+arm+reconaissnace&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3149j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;final round of procurement&lt;/a&gt; in the army’s Short Range Reconnaissance Program, and &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com./story/drone-maker-swooping-us-pushback-against-dji/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Skydio also has contracts with the Air Force and DEA. The firm is also working with at least one police department in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6fzN7"&gt;Skydio’s drones will be used for emergency response, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and the company says it has no plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;weaponize its tech&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also working on new consumer drones, too. “We have more products coming in that market that we’re excited about,” Skydio CEO Adam Bry told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear when these will be launched. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My PS5 is now matte black thanks to Dbrand’s Darkplates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLixiYNSAsVaxNNU0WxJVcX8WxM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890147/DSCF7519.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A stealthy look for the elusive console&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dcWNPH"&gt;Maybe you like the PlayStation 5’s distinctive white-and-black look. Maybe you don’t. Maybe you’d settle for a Zune-brown and orange model as long as you could find it in stock. But wherever you come down on the PS5’s color, one thing’s for sure: there’s a lot of demand for other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPkHUQ"&gt;That’s what Dbrand was betting when it put its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;matte black replacement “Darkplates”&lt;/a&gt; on sale recently while baiting Sony to sue. Successive waves of the product sold out fast to the point where they’re now almost as hard to find as the PS5 itself; the next batch won’t ship til May, though you can still put a &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;backorder&lt;/a&gt; in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0wAb6"&gt;Anyway, I don’t mind how the PS5 looks myself, but since Dbrand sent over a set of Darkplates, I was curious whether they’d change my mind. This afternoon I took off my PS5’s lightplates (?) to see for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsnRIF"&gt;The process is quite simple. Here’s Dbrand’s video on how to replace the PS5’s plates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ikaAio"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-EhMd0sj9Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6DyYP7"&gt;I found it a little more difficult to take off the stock white plates than this video suggests, but I was reluctant to apply too much force out of fear of damaging my rare-as-hens’-teeth console. Once you do manage to unhook the plates and slide them off, it’s very easy to attach the Darkplates in their place — they just pop right in with a satisfying click. It doesn’t feel like you’re doing anything the PS5 wasn’t intended to do out of the box, so I think Sony is missing out by not selling its own official swappable plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysq0KV"&gt;Here’s how the PS5 looks on both sides with the stock plates removed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ll9G5z8iSiJUyhpLLYtlwVaDR30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336314/DSCF7500.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XL-nkc0GENQowZE6nFE9XarAMxs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336315/DSCF7502.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LtX0Wl"&gt;And here are some shots with the Darkplates attached:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A_uEb0qxHqJNCwzMO5YzONoNTbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336328/DSCF7512.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qv6do79hFHwJdmVZOj6lvuGS5qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336318/DSCF7515.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgugwoW1aK-408183TUZYGKcGuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336319/DSCF7516.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSWEy5"&gt;The Darkplates feel sturdy and of high quality — these aren’t just flimsy pieces of plastic. You’d expect as much for $49 plus shipping, of course. But Dbrand has definitely gone the extra mile to make this feel like a premium product, and this is maybe best expressed by the company’s own spin on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt;. As on the PS5, it’s difficult to see with the naked eye or to photograph, but it’s there:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUhPIq1RuxBp680mLNchoveNnO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336320/DSCF7522.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7006XR"&gt;Dbrand also sent over a matte black skin to cover the glossy black middle portions of the PS5. These are available in various colors, too. I found it easier to apply than I expected, but it didn’t turn out 100-percent perfect — the skin was slightly lopsided around the USB-A port, though not in any way that’d obstruct usage. But I’m not really convinced that I prefer this look to simply leaving the middle section glossy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJI8IJ"&gt;Here are some shots with the skin attached for full matte-black effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gS2Eq1i8oU-P-yvn4ZLT0S7se84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336322/DSCF7519.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKzSdSL-nJbnsn3CRycbVdxBp0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336304/DSCF7516.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Tqe_jfiOzLkPIhSrJcVZqUOJvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336323/DSCF7518.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PT5WVzlzJZJgKoBmrsrxCxUQcs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336324/DSCF7523.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qMz6Td"&gt;Finally, I thought I’d compare my newly matte black PS5 to the similarly matte black Xbox Series X. I have to admit, the black finish does seem to have a slimming effect on the PS5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X5DQVB66puyvZuKyfCjE35Ej29M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336325/DSCF7525.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ciMyIlOdg-cy-_9vb36XF1xJ-OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336326/DSCF7526.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUsPd1"&gt;As mentioned before, the Darkplates cost $49 plus shipping, while the middle skin is an extra $11.95. You can still &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;order now&lt;/a&gt;, but they won’t ship until May. Is it a lot to pay to change your PS5’s color? Yes. But if you have your heart set on the idea, I think you’ll enjoy the Darkplates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned the iPhone’s excellent document scanner can be controlled from a Mac </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSKih4ZMZU_bnMAuq3a4Vp3T9r0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890064/macos_mojave_mail_insert_continuity_camera_uncropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scan documents directly into Mail, Finder, and other Mac apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VzDjwm"&gt;The iPhone’s Notes app has a powerful document scanning feature built right into it, and today I learned that this scanner can be controlled directly from a paired Mac in a variety of apps. It’s an incredibly useful tip for Mac users as it cuts out the awkward middle steps of having to transfer it from phone to computer, or grabbing it from the Mac’s Notes app after it syncs. Shoutout to TikTok account &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keyboardshortcuts/video/6932538573182864645?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow9cMUNyMOkFIuCRcO4Th%2BsZMqOgP%2BfcLYE79iAO63xtEW2JBKIpVVkSlinLm5IENOGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZoPuAG0cRxyaGHfZc077n7yevrdk2cjBsqsGdaASBbmsbkXLgk8CWoaeD6XSuvJA&amp;amp;share_item_id=6932538573182864645&amp;amp;share_link_id=115A424D-A15C-4E18-9DFE-2C18D8613353&amp;amp;timestamp=1614464675&amp;amp;tt_from=more&amp;amp;u_code=d33lm8d588e9ii&amp;amp;user_id=6621985261382615045&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=more&amp;amp;source=h5_m"&gt;@keyboardshortcuts&lt;/a&gt; for bringing it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izerq1"&gt;Besides Notes, the iPhone’s scanner can be accessed from a number of different Mac apps, including the Finder, Mail, Messages, and Pages 7.2 and later. To use it, control-click (or right-click) in the window you want to scan the document into, select “Import from iPhone or iPad,” and then click “Scan Documents.” The camera app will magically open on the linked mobile device, where a scan can be taken as usual — no wires required. Once done, the scanned document will end up in the Mac app with a minimum of hassle. I found it useful to scan a bunch of legal documents directly into a new folder in Finder, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thD6MH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@keyboardshortcuts/video/6932538573182864645" data-video-id="6932538573182864645" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@keyboardshortcuts" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keyboardshortcuts"&gt;@keyboardshortcuts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love this one   Link in bio for more    &lt;a title="laptophacks" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/laptophacks"&gt;#laptophacks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="learnontiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/learnontiktok"&gt;#learnontiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="tutorials" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tutorials"&gt;#tutorials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lifehacks" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lifehacks"&gt;#lifehacks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="mac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mac"&gt;#mac&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="macbook" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/macbook"&gt;#macbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Background Music - Avatar" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Background-Music-6694670856355842050"&gt;♬ Background Music - Avatar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIVffl"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209037"&gt;support page for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, the Mac will need to be running macOS Mojave or above, and the iPhone or iPad needs to be running iOS 12 and above. Both devices need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on, and signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8e7ke"&gt;As well as scanning documents, the feature can also be used to take photos. Simply select “Take Photo” rather than “Scan Documents” from the menu and tap the shutter button on your mobile device to capture an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGtrmO"&gt;Camera Continuity isn’t a new feature, but its compatibility with the iPhone’s document scanner was news to me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polaris teases an all-electric Ranger, first in its collaboration with Zero Motorcycles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4neW6BP-enLiGsJ3jZwAlwFccC8=/270x0:8093x5215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68890007/PII_Image_for_3.1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zRD1WN"&gt;The first electric power sports vehicle to emerge from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;new collaboration between Polaris and Zero Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; will be a battery-powered Ranger utility side-by-side. The companies didn’t provide any details about the vehicle’s range, battery pack, or price, but they did say that production on the new UTV (or utility terrain vehicle) was expected to start in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKHj2u"&gt;Ranger is the number one-selling brand in the Minnesota-based Polaris’ lineup of utility vehicles. More details are forthcoming, a spokesperson said, but the goal is to “build a better Ranger with more torque, more power, more hauling, the capabilities needed to give customers the advantage. Electric allows Polaris to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ycylug"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Polaris and Zero Motorcycles signed a 10-year agreement last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysgQwb"&gt;Polaris and Zero Motorcycles signed a 10-year agreement last year to produce a range of electric vehicles, including ATVs, UTVs, and snowmobiles. Both companies hope to seize upon what they think has been an overlooked market for electrification, starting with off-road vehicles and snowmobiles. Ultimately, they hope to make an electric version of every type of vehicle in Polaris’ lineup by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS0h5P"&gt;“With the rising interest in electrified vehicles, we are investing in electrification in order to meet the needs of current customers as well as appeal to tomorrow’s power sports riders,” Mike Speetzen, Polaris’ interim CEO, said in a statement. “The all-new electric Ranger is our latest effort aimed at leading the industry forward in electrified power sports vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR3KUt"&gt;Unlike ATVs, which are recognizable for their straddle-seated position and handlebar steering, UTVs are used more for work than recreation. The large, powerful vehicles are commonly used to haul equipment and supplies in locations that make using a truck impractical or impossible. They are also called side-by-sides because they can accommodate both a driver and a passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGqddA"&gt;Polaris’ gas-powered Rangers generally range (pun intended) in price between $20,000 and $22,000 and are popular vehicles with agriculture workers, hunters, and other outdoor lovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2dnBj"&gt;The electric Ranger is being designed and developed by Polaris and Zero at a facility in Wyoming, Minnesota, with manufacturing to take place at Polaris’ facility in Huntsville, Alabama. The first vehicles are expected to roll out to dealerships early next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime says it will spend $50 million on a huge e-bike expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcMg8n9_69TIhJNXXxYMOUBpuCs=/0x514:7713x5656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68889668/Lime_feb2020_reamer013_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FJVGu"&gt;Lime is getting back to its roots. The scooter company formerly known as LimeBike says it will invest $50 million to grow its shared electric bicycle network, including adding a new model of bike and doubling the number of cities in which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJSCdr"&gt;Lime got its start with shared bikes, only to quickly pivot after Bird first introduced the concept of dockless electric scooters in 2017. The company dropped the “bike” from its name and started phasing out its bikes in 2019. But the following year, Lime acquired bike-share company Jump from Uber, and suddenly, bikes were back on the menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oD4irY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;50 new cities by the start of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIRzaN"&gt;Now, the company is doubling down on shared electric bikes, with plans to launch in “a dozen” new cities in North America by the end of the year, as well as dozens more in Europe and other markets. In total, the company plans to have its bikes in 50 new cities by the start of 2022, roughly quadrupling its fleet size. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3r4FAeP07c14WtBbtjKmrSHl34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331790/E_bike_Specs.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TL13D4"&gt;The $50 million investment will largely go toward designing, manufacturing, and assembling its next-generation bike, which will start rolling out this summer. The new model will come with a more powerful 350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjMuz"&gt;The battery is also interchangeable with the ones that power Lime’s Gen4 electric scooters, allowing for a standardized battery charging operation. A two-speed gear shifter will help with those hill climbs, and an integrated, electronically controlled hub lock will help keep the bike safe from theft and vandalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P1Hrpe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;350-watt motor and a swappable battery &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEMymJ"&gt;There are other new features on the bike: the handlebars are being replaced with ones similar to Lime’s scooters, there’s a phone holder in the front basket, and the bike will be able to hit speeds of up to 20mph (depending on local regulations). It weighs 72 pounds, which is heavier than the 65-pound electric Citi Bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QazEAe"&gt;Lime will keep its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355020/lime-jump-ebikes-app-share-rent-uber-scrapped"&gt;cherry-red Jump bikes in operation&lt;/a&gt;, with no plans to phase those out in favor of the new Lime-branded e-bikes. The company has stated that it wants to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;a multimodal provider of many different types of low-speed, electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers. And recently, it announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;introduce electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in Paris and Washington, DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIUUfL"&gt;The new investment in e-bikes comes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;cycling is surging around the globe&lt;/a&gt;, with bike sales — and especially e-bike sales — hitting record numbers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;Legislation has been introduced&lt;/a&gt; in the US to make e-bikes more affordable. And bike-share systems are adding more electric models to their fleets in the hopes of attracting more members. Lime says its customers took more than 2.5 million rides on its e-bikes last year, with the company expecting that number to grow significantly in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
