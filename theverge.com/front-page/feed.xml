    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaxfXA"&gt;Jack Black is set to play snarky robot Claptrap in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jack-black-joins-cate-blanchett-in-borderlands-movie"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jack-black-eli-roth-cate-blanchett-borderlands-lionsgate-1234692217/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jack-black-borderlands-movie-claptrap-1234906098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and other publications. He joins what’s turning out to be an all-star cast, which also includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Cate Blanchett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6kN8J"&gt;The movie will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145855/borderlands-film-eli-roth-gearbox-live-action-adaptation-direct"&gt;directed by Eli Roth&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently directed &lt;em&gt;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&lt;/em&gt;, which Blanchett and Black also starred in. “I am so excited to reunite with Jack, this time in the recording booth,” he said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Claptrap&lt;/em&gt; is the funniest character in the game, and Jack is perfect to bring him to the big screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI59a8"&gt;If you ask me, Black’s wild exuberance is a perfect match for the robot’s quippy in-game persona. If you haven’t played the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; series before, just watch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K3R3iBwGTKA"&gt;this compilation&lt;/a&gt; of some of Claptrap’s best quotes from the second game to get an idea of the role Black is gearing up for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="orip7B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie adaptation has been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/28/9220215/borderlands-movie-being-made"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Blanchett is set to play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Lilith"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Curtis will play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Patricia_Tannis"&gt;Tannis&lt;/a&gt;, and Kevin Hart will play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Roland#"&gt;Roland&lt;/a&gt;. Craig Mazin, who co-created &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;and is a writer and executive producer on HBO’s take on &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us, &lt;/em&gt;is writing the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVdVMt"&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the casting for Joel and Ellie was just announced on Wednesday: Pedro Pascal (who plays the titular character in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;will play Joel&lt;/a&gt;, and Bella Ramsey (who starred as the beloved Lyanna Mormont in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;will play Ellie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Biden administration is working to help address global semiconductor chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel Skylake chip shots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buVJNS_Gq-1EHLukwJ_YiaSmL-4=/2x0:1018x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804655/vs09-02_0831cxs-2.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvVeEE"&gt;The White House has pledged to help address the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, with President Joe Biden said to be signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review along with developing a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages, &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28CjUx"&gt;The cause of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html"&gt;current shortage&lt;/a&gt; is due to a mixture of factors: spikes in demand for consumer electronic products like laptops due to changes in lifestyle caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; slowdowns in chip production also caused by the pandemic; a business model in the semiconductor industry that sees most companies outsource chip production to firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) instead of building the parts themselves; and lingering effects from former President Donald Trump’s trade war with China that made it harder for US companies to work with Chinese chip producers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cx1fji"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shortage impacts everything from PS5s to Ford F-150s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhqzaw"&gt;The result is companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD’s newest CPUs and GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKuE0s"&gt;But in today’s increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies — including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota — have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford just announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vt74t"&gt;To that end, the Biden administration is reportedly working with businesses and trade partners to try to alleviate some of these issues. And while it’s good to see the US government looking to address the issue, the United States’ limited involvement in physical semiconductor manufacturing makes its actual avenues toward addressing the issue unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has doubled bullying and harassment takedowns since last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cShX-nRuDt2XKF7-OLPXERpVPKM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804462/akrales_180614_1777_0110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvBCj7"&gt;On Thursday, Facebook released a new moderation transparency report showing a marked uptick in bullying and harassment enforcement, which reached a peak of 6.3 million total takedowns through the last quarter of 2020. It’s an increase from 3.5 million pieces last quarter and 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company said much of the change is due to improvements in the automated systems that analyze Facebook and Instagram comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nktvmz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook’s latest transparency report&lt;/a&gt; covers October to December 2020, a period that includes the US presidential election. During that time, the main Facebook network removed more harassment, organized hate and hate speech, and suicide and self-harm content. Instagram saw significant jumps in bullying and self-harm removals. The company says its numbers were shaped by two factors: more human review capacity and improvements in artificial intelligence, especially for non-English posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iC0a94"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re investing in technology across all the different sorts of ways that people share.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HcL5t"&gt;The company also indicates it will lean on automation to address a growing amount of video and audio on its platforms, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;rumored Clubhouse competitor&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re investing in technology across all the different sorts of ways that people share,” said CTO Mike Schroepfer on a call with reporters. “We understand audio, video, we understand the content around those things, who shared it, and build a broader picture of what’s happening there.” Facebook hasn’t confirmed the existence of a Clubhouse-like audio platform, but “I think there’s a lot we’re doing here that can apply to these different formats, and we obviously look at how the products are changing and invest ahead of those changes to make sure we have the technological tools we need,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxNSHh"&gt;Facebook pushed some moderation teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530428/facebook-moderators-dublin-work-in-office-ireland-lockdown-covid-19"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525600/facebook-moderators-india-covid-19-office-return-work-safety-health-concern"&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt; in early October; although it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573526/facebook-content-moderators-open-letter-coronavirus-protections-demands-accenture"&gt;said in November&lt;/a&gt; that most moderators worked remotely, it’s also said that some sensitive content can’t be reviewed from home. Now, the company says increased moderation has helped Facebook and Instagram remove more suicide and self-injury posts. Facebook removed 2.5 million pieces of violating content, compared to 1.3 million pieces the preceding quarter, and Instagram removed 3.4 million pieces, up from 1.3 million. That’s comparable to pre-pandemic levels for Facebook, and it’s a significant absolute increase for Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tK7pRlC1YLHQnEd-cKWFrRabiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_11.42.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook bullying and harassment takedowns between Q3 2018 and Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XGa0lr"&gt;Conversely, Facebook attributes some increases to AI-powered moderation. It removed 6.3 million pieces of bullying and harassing content on Facebook, for instance, which is nearly double the numbers from previous quarters. On Instagram, it removed 5 million pieces of content, up from 2.6 million pieces last quarter and 1.5 million pieces at the end of 2019. Those increases stem from tech that better analyzes comments in the context of the accompanying post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhU9kw"&gt;Non-English language moderation has been a historic weak point for Facebook, and the company says it has improved AI language detection in Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese, fueling a hate speech takedown increase from 22.1 million to 26.9 million pieces. That’s not as big as the jump Facebook saw in late 2019, however, when it made what it described as dramatic improvements to its automated detection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5weeoGCJ2W-qcvXGHXGCqjbo5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297416/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_11.32.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook hate speech takedowns between Q4 2017 and Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IU0VL"&gt;Facebook says it’s changed its News Feed in ways that reduce the amount of hate speech and violent content people see. A survey of hate speech in the third quarter found that users averaged between 10 and 11 pieces of hate speech for every 10,000 pieces of content; in the fourth quarter, that dropped to seven or eight pieces. The company said it was still formulating responses to some suggestions from the Facebook Oversight Board, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;released its first decisions last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8Cser"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We think that regulation would be a very good thing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oMdcWu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575139/facebook-moderation-ai-hate-speech"&gt;As it did last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook suggested lawmakers could use its transparency report as the model for a legal framework. Facebook has supported changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a broad liability shield that has come under fire from critics of social media. “We think that regulation would be a very good thing,” said Monika Bickert, VP of content policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvqOHX"&gt;However, Facebook has not backed a specific legislative proposal — including the SAFE TECH Act, a sweeping rollback proposed in Congress last week. “We remain committed to having this dialogue with everybody in the United States who is working on finding a way forward with regulation,” said Bickert. “We’ve obviously seen a number of proposals in this area, and we’ve seen different focuses from different people on the Hill in terms of what they want to pursue, and we want to make sure that we are part of all those conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkFr1B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mURAbW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: if you use Slack on Android, you might want to update your password </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YQpXbibxcHWjonpk1m6OvZFTdVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68800611/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="my2r08"&gt;You might want to change your Slack password if you used the app on Android. According to an email sent out by the company &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/that-slack-email-you-just-got-asking-to-reset-your-password-is-legit-not-a-scam/"&gt;and published by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Android version of the Slack app stored users’ credentials in plain text between December 21st and January 21st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20686514/android-covert-channel-permissions-data-collection-imei-ssid-location"&gt;theoretically&lt;/a&gt; meaning other apps on your phone could have had access to them. Slack  says it hasn’t seen any unauthorized access, and that it’s already emailed all affected users and invalidated their passwords — so if you had to enter in a new password when you opened the app, that could be why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIxTZH"&gt;After we published this story, the company reached out to clarify that it believes your passwords were still secure — the logs would be private unless users had a rooted phone with protections turned off. The company also says this only affected users who logged on with their email address and passwords during that one-month period — whereas a lot of large organizations, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; included, use a single-sign-on (SSO) system instead. If you use SSO, or were already logged in, you shouldn’t have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib9jM5"&gt;If you’ve got the popular communications tool installed on your Android phone, the first thing you’ll want to do is update to the latest version from the Play Store, since changing your password won’t do any good if you’re still running the old version. Then, if you got the email from Slack, you can click on the link to change your password. You can also do it manually from a desktop computer &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/201909068-Reset-your-password"&gt;using Slack’s instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5fLzM"&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://slack.com/signin#/signin"&gt;sign in to Slack&lt;/a&gt;, then go to your profile, which can be accessed by clicking your picture in the top right-hand corner of the app or web app and clicking View Profile. Then, click the More button and Account Settings. From there, you should be able to change your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYqPGX"&gt;Of course, if you used your Slack password on other websites, you should change your passwords for those, too (preferably to something unique). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujt0tU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 11th, 12:35AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Slack’s clarification that the passwords were stored in private logs, and that the issue should have only affected users who logged in with an email and password specifically during the one-month period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Aoki teamed up with Capcom on a Street Fighter arcade cabinet and clothing line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JieIeH4miq7hLf6GNc5DVqK-zVM=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804078/SFAoki__Countercade_2Player_1.21.21_3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8viko3"&gt;DJ Steve Aoki and his Dim Mak record label and fashion brand have teamed up with Capcom on some cool &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;-themed items: a limited edition countertop arcade cabinet, a clothing line, and even a remix of the theme song for &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter &lt;/em&gt;icon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Ryu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8JKXQ"&gt;The countertop arcade cabinet, which you can see at the top of this post, will allow up to two players to play four different Capcom games together: &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II: World Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Final Fight&lt;/em&gt;. The cabinet is made in partnership with &lt;a href="https://arcade1up.com/"&gt;Arcade1Up&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the first two-player countertop cabinet the company has made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rErZbi"&gt;In addition to the slick art on the cabinet, each one is signed by Aoki. But if you want to get your hands on it, you’ll need to act fast as there are only 30 units available. The cabinet &lt;a href="https://dimmakcollection.com/collections/dim-mak-x-street-fighter/products/dim-mak-x-arcade1up-street-fighter-ii-countercade"&gt;costs $199&lt;/a&gt; and will ship in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSKNti"&gt;There’s also a line of &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;-inspired apparel. You can see the &lt;a href="https://dimmakcollection.com/collections/dim-mak-x-street-fighter"&gt;whole collection on the Dim Mak website&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve included a few pictures in this gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y5OXYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10337933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKfvBX"&gt;The remix of Ryu’s theme song, titled “Ryu’s Theme (The Moe’s Pizzeria Steve Aoki Remix),” isn’t out just yet. It will be available on February 19th, but you can pre-save it to your streaming service of choice &lt;a href="https://ffm.to/ryustheme"&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t heard the remix yet, but I’m looking forward to checking out Aoki’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO7JEqIPQv0"&gt;iconic song&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQh45"&gt;According to a press release announcing the collaboration, Aoki was a huge &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; fan growing up, heading to a local pizzeria every day after school to play the game. That love for the series definitely shows on the cabinet and in the apparel collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdRRnC"&gt;And Aoki’s main? “Ryu,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. (I can’t say that’s surprising, given Ryu’s prominence on much of the gear.) “I always picked him when I was a kid when I obsessively played &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II.&lt;/em&gt; He represents the strong, iconic, Japanese warrior hero that I always aspired to become,” Aoki said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos gets new paywalled editing features for Google One subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4Bci5rVuLg_C6ZytQpGabrpDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804071/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMG5RX"&gt;Google is adding some of its fancy, Pixel-exclusive editing features to Google Photos today for all Android users to enjoy, but there’s a catch — if you don’t have a Pixel, you’ll have to be a paying Google One subscriber to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vs0xBz"&gt;The paywalled editing features have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553303/google-photos-editing-features-color-pop-one-subscription"&gt;rumored for some time&lt;/a&gt;, but today marks the official announcement of the new program. Specifically, Google is offering some of its more recent machine-learning powered editing tools, like its enhanced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/more-helpful-pixel-features/"&gt;Portrait Blur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/new-helpful-editor/"&gt;Portrait Light&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/take-action-sharing-editing/"&gt;Color Pop&lt;/a&gt; features that it started offering alongside the Pixel 5 last fall to a broader audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7309P0"&gt;As Google clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; when the paywall was first discovered, the company isn’t taking away existing versions of features like Portrait Blur or Color Pop from free Google Photo users. The current iteration of those features — which work with newer photos that offer depth data, such as a portrait mode shot — will still work for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FsTlb"&gt;But the new Pixel- and subscription-only version promises to take things a step further and allows users to apply those effects (through the power of machine learning) to older photos that don’t have that existing depth data. Pixel users will still get access to the features for free, whether or not they subscribe to Google One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPBjbM"&gt;Along with the new editing features, Google is also offering new AI-powered filters: a new “dynamic” option that automatically enhances brightness and contrast, and “sky suggestions” that can tweak skylines for more dramatic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58yg0E1sai2rY1bqjbzU1WiqRTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297256/blog_sky_palette_v3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “sky suggestions” filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vYm1Rh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Photos_editing"&gt;Google One&lt;/a&gt; subscriptions start at $1.99 per month and primarily focus on expanding storage for Google services (the base plan, for example, offers 100GB of space over the 15GB of included free storage). Google also offers additional perks to subscribers to help sweeten the deal, like Google Store rewards — the new Google Photos editing features are likely part of that plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOyHfC"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Google is expanding the photo-focused offerings with Google One just months before it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;ends its free unlimited storage program for Google Photos&lt;/a&gt; — meaning that the company will likely be pushing Google One as a solution for users who’ll need more storage space for their pictures, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqR8gr"&gt;Lastly, Google announced that it’ll be introducing some feature parity between its iOS and Android versions of the app. The Android version is set to get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409339/google-photos-ios-update-crop-trim-add-filters-video-editor"&gt;improved video editor&lt;/a&gt; that Google already offers for iOS in the coming weeks, and the iOS version will be updated to receive the new photo editor that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495793/google-photos-editing-tools-app-update-machine-learning-suggestions-android"&gt;Google introduced last fall&lt;/a&gt; in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Post Malone will hold a virtual concert to celebrate Pokémon’s 25th anniversary </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXq4QArvuK8hccByEP5WHHrazrE=/529x0:2536x1338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804066/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_11.16.25_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WynNnV"&gt;Post Malone is joining &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;’s 25th anniversary celebration with a virtual concert. The rapper will perform on February 27th in a digital event kicking off at 7PM ET. On YouTube, the company released a teaser video alongside the news, which includes a look at a very Pixar-ish, animated version of the artist ahead of the performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QctYS"&gt;The Pokémon Company International announced P25, a series of musical events, last month with news that pop star &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;Katy Perry will headline&lt;/a&gt;. Post Malone’s concert will be a free event fans can tune into over on the event’s &lt;a href="https://25.pokemon.com/en-us/"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pokemon/featured"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Pokemon"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. The event is also expected to include more news on upcoming musical acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PA9ctX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtQx4R2M2iw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ortZG"&gt;In the absence of live events, more games are turning to virtual concerts these days, with artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557275/lil-nas-x-roblox-virtual-performance-announced-holiday-old-town-road"&gt;Lil Nas X&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and last year, Travis Scott’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; performance turned the entire game into one big stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVTvmX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ilgAJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je1SNy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWgjqk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max will launch internationally in June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ho1sJ-uf0FEBoQx4ghY7bNz9JRo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803995/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6X2aQx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21272223/hbo-max-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; will finally make its international debut in June, with the streaming service set to launch in Latin America and the Caribbean. Currently, HBO Max is only available in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah8gvi"&gt;The Latin America rollout is just the first phase of HBO Max’s international debut. The company promises it will also transition HBO-branded services in Europe (specifically, “the Nordics, Spain, Central Europe, and Portugal”) to HBO Max later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yBrDpF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CG7VvdRZ1xo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nAch4y"&gt;The June launch will see HBO Max expand to 39 countries and territories across Latin America and the Caribbean, including Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, B.V.I., Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Montserrat, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago, Turks and Caicos, Uruguay, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvT7Pf"&gt;As with the (somewhat messy) launch in the US, WarnerMedia will phase out the HBO Go app and service entirely and replace it with a new HBO Max app that should look virtually identical to the US app. Customers who pay for HBO Go directly through WarnerMedia (or through “eligible partners”) will automatically be converted to HBO Max — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;hopefully with less confusion than the US rollout&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gi3a8M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HBO Max is full of potential, but its biggest hurdle remains AT&amp;amp;T’s messy execution","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="061pU8"&gt;The company promises it’ll have more details for the Latin America rollout — including what content will be available, promotional offers, and more — closer to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29qYIE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 exclusive Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart will launch on June 11th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eusm4j"&gt;We already knew Insomniac Games was working on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ai3o0XtrnM8"&gt;a sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the 2016 reboot of &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;. And today, Sony announced that &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;will launch on June 11th &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/11/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-arrives-on-ps5-june-11/"&gt;exclusively for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cjowl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; will have the titular characters traveling across multiple realities as they try to stop a dastardly emperor who is attempting to exterminate organic life from all the universes. Like other titles on Sony’s next-gen console, the game will take advantage of the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/08/27/an-extended-look-at-ratchet-clank-rift-apart-gameplay/"&gt;PS5’s hardware&lt;/a&gt;, including support for ray tracing, and it will take advantage of the DualSense game controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jDSPF"&gt;The game was originally announced last June during Sony’s next-gen showcase. A few months later, Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401754/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-trailer-gameplay-sony-playstation-5-ps5-gamescom-2020"&gt;released seven minutes of new gameplay footage&lt;/a&gt; at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBMBR"&gt;This is the third big PS5 console exclusive releasing this year, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261214/destruction-allstars-playstation-5-ps5-sony-interview-cars-demolition-derby"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;' release earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently free), and Arkane Studios’ &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/12/21562692/deathloop-arkane-lyon-release-date-ps5-pc"&gt;launch on May 21st&lt;/a&gt; and will remain a PS5 console exclusive for one year.&lt;/p&gt;
