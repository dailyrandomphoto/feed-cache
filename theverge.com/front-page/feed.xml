    <title>Fortnite is ending its second chapter with a big event on December 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h45zzd5WwtvKsLwgGoHYCF7zmdc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187346/18BR_Chapter2Finale_TheEnd_notext.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cnxx1v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s next big in-game event won’t just mark the end of the latest season — it’ll also draw chapter 2 to a close as well. Called, appropriately, “The End,” the one-time-only event will take place on December 4th at 4PM ET. Developer Epic describes it as “one last stand for the fate of the island,” suggesting that players will soon be playing on a brand-new map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaZSFG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s last chapter-ending event was arguably its most ambitious, when a black hole destroyed the battle royale’s original island, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;taking the game offline for several days&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;before chapter 2 emerged&lt;/a&gt;. There are no hints as to what chapter 3 might look like when it debuts in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oAXd0s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvJOUu"&gt;This season has been building towards some kind of cataclysmic event from the beginning. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;Initially, the map was overrun with mysterious cubes&lt;/a&gt;, which slowly converged on the center of the island, eventually forming a pyramid housing a strange figure known as the Cube Queen who floated in the air like the Eye of Sauron. The season — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;which was preceded by an explosive alien invasion&lt;/a&gt; — was also an eventful one in terms of collaborations, including the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735293/fortnite-dune-crossover-skins-paul-atreides-timothee-chalamet-zendaya"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22777304/fortnite-naruto-collaboration-skins-emotes-creative-map"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22760266/league-of-legends-jinx-fortnite-netflix-arcane"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679754/fortnite-balenciaga-collaboration-epic-games-unreal-engine"&gt;Balenciaga&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2xmWr"&gt;“The End” event will support squads of up to 16 players, and, as always, Epic suggests players get in at least 30 minutes early to guarantee a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Help your loved ones stay healthy and happy with gifts suitable for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c6YEGG"&gt;There’s nothing quite like a global pandemic to remind you how true that old cliché is: at the end of the day, health really is wealth. During these past two years, however, emotional wellness has become just as important as physical health, making gifts that focus on our mental wellbeing just as meaningful as those that impact our physical one. Luckily, our gift guide features a range of ideas that should appeal to both, many of which were solicited directly from the rest of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Io2XdI"&gt;Below, you’ll find an under-desk elliptical for the friend who finds making time to go to the gym challenging, as well as the latest Apple Watch and a pair of sunglasses that let you ditch your earbuds at home. We’ve also included gift cards for popular therapy and meditation services — perfect for loved ones looking for ways to destress during the holidays — along with gifts that should also work well with any budget. Take a look and see what great stuff you can get to help your family and friends stay healthy and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This graphene battery pack charges incredibly fast  </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7alZ0X88ARESAFtw_-osCunm2XQ=/63x0:2016x1302/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122368/elecjet_stacked_report_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra power bank charges five times faster than conventional battery packs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UppGZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 24th, 09:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original Indiegogo campaign was terminated (with all contributions refunded) and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D2ac4b231%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reinstated here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. The issue, according to Elecjet, resulted from a recent change in the legal designation of the company from LLC to Corporation that unexpectedly changed its Tax ID and the campaign’s ability to process payments. Unfortunately, the delay incurred by the relaunch means that Elecjet can no longer guarantee shipment by Christmas. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9Od71n"&gt;
&lt;p id="75BGe1"&gt;Elecjet’s new Apollo Ultra battery pack uses graphene to dramatically speed up charging. Yes, graphene, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17548362/graphene-material-breakthrough-science-technology-hype"&gt;miracle material that has long promised to change the world&lt;/a&gt;, allows this 10,000mAh portable battery to charge from zero to full in less than 30 minutes, about five to six times faster than a conventional power bank of the same capacity. Plug it in when you wake up and the Apollo Ultra should be fully charged by the time you leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AckQZ"&gt;Graphene is a highly conductive lattice of carbon only one atom thick. Pure graphene batteries are still too expensive to mass-produce, but the material can already accelerate the charging characteristics of traditional batteries when applied to an electrode in composite form. That’s the approach Elecjet is taking with its new 10,000mAh (40Wh) battery &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D2ac4b231%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching today on Indiegogo for $65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6RBu"&gt;In addition to a faster charge rate, Elecjet says the Apollo Ultra will last for more than 2,500 charging cycles before the battery drops below 80 percent health. That’s roughly four to five times longer than conventional lithium-ion battery packs, which would be good for both your wallet and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44FbHa"&gt;I can’t conceivably test the lifespan claim, but Elecjet did send me a review sample of the Apollo Ultra to validate the improved charging speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH67Q7"&gt;In short, the Apollo Ultra charges fast — &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; fast, just as Elecjet claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QjhUiC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charges from zero to full in 27 minutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7epebg"&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is a lithium-polymer battery that’s been enhanced with Real Graphene USA’s proprietary battery technology. It’s fitted with two USB ports: one full-sized USB-A and one USB-C PD 3.0. The USB-C port accepts an input of up to 100W to quickly charge the battery pack. That port is then capable of 65W out, making it powerful enough to charge many USB-C laptops. It supports Samsung’s PPS fast charging tech and holds enough energy to charge a typical phone two or three times. The USB-A port is capable of 18W max output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE5Ha3"&gt;Fine, but it’s the battery’s charging speed that we’re all here for, and Elecjet says the Apollo Ultra will charge from zero to full in a very impressive 27 minutes when connected to a powerful 100W wall charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="9tAe8o"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Elecjet Apollo Ultra comparison|103965" data-volume-uuid="be818d871" data-volume-id="103965" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-717" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time lapse comparing the Elecjet Apollo Ultra charging speed with a conventional power bank of the same capacity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAOsMX"&gt;My review unit repeatedly charged from zero to 99.9 percent in 27 minutes, using a 100W GaN charger (sold separately for about $50) that Elecjet supplied. It then took another 90 seconds to report 100% on the battery’s display. Elecjet says this is a minor bug, and the battery is “99.999 percent” charged at 27 minutes. The Elecjet Apollo Ultra otherwise charges linearly, reaching 25 percent in 6.5 minutes, 50 percent in 13 minutes, and 80 percent in about 21 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbM7zt"&gt;For comparison, I connected the same 100W charger to a 10,000mAh lithium-ion battery I recently purchased on AliExpress for about $20. It took over three hours to charge from zero to full. That supports Elecjet’s claim that the graphene-enriched Apollo Ultra charges five times faster than conventional battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiZEsw"&gt;I also charged the Apollo Ultra battery from my MacBook’s less powerful 29W charger. The power bank charged from zero to full in 74 minutes. That’s a lot slower, as you’d expect from the weaker charger, but still more than two times faster than the AliExpress battery connected to the 100W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBDgJ0"&gt;Things got a little odd when trying to charge two devices simultaneously off the Apollo Ultra. My MacBook reported that it was being charged at 65W when connected to the USB-C port. It then dropped to just 5W after I plugged in either an iPhone X or Oppo Find X3 Pro to charge simultaneously from the USB-A port. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D2ac4b231%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2Ffaq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Indiegogo campaign FAQ claims&lt;/a&gt; that the Apollo Ultra’s “output power of 87W will be divided between the two devices” so something seems awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5D4mvc"&gt;The Apollo Ultra I’ve been testing warmed up only slightly in the 20 or so times I’ve fully charged and discharged it, while the slow charging lithium-ion reference battery remained cool throughout. “Warm” is commendable considering the Apollo Ultra is drawing more than five times the power, and speaks to graphene’s efficiency at dissipating heat. Elecjet tells me that the Apollo Ultra is fitted with eight safety features and that UL temperature testing never exceeded 42C (107.6F).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dxy4huIheEoyFXc1XOgM-kmInRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001942/verge_DSC_6753_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is slightly thicker than conventional power banks of the same capacity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHMTP"&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is also chubbier than my reference battery despite holding the same number of electrons. That’s due to the larger power module required to handle the higher input and output wattages. While the unit’s size won’t change for the product that ships to Indiegogo backers, Elecjet tells me that the next-gen power module should allow its future hybrids to match the size of its slower charging predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="9G55DE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQKiKD"&gt;Chinese phone makers are currently embroiled in a fast-charging race of their own. Xiaomi’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675191/xiaomi-11t-pro-lite-120-fast-charging-announced-specs-price"&gt;11T Pro&lt;/a&gt; has a 5,000mAh battery that charges from zero to 100 percent in just 17 minutes with its bundled 120W charger. But that battery is a dual-cell design, allowing both halves to charge simultaneously. That’s fine for $500+ phones with sophisticated chipsets that aren’t limited by the constraints of USB-C PD. Nevertheless, Elecjet matches that 17 minutes charge with its other graphene-enriched battery pack, &lt;a href="https://elecjet.com/products/apollo-traveller-graphene-usb-c-pd-power-bank-5000mah"&gt;the 5,000mAh Apollo Traveller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvzcAb"&gt;That’s right — the Apollo Ultra isn’t the first graphene hybrid battery pack available to buy. In addition to Elecjet’s offerings, Chargeasap makes a number of hybrid battery packs, including a &lt;a href="https://chargeasap.com/collections/graphene-power-banks"&gt;monster $299 20,000mAh battery pack&lt;/a&gt; that’s also laced with graphene, only with more ports, a wireless charging surface, and higher 100W output. The company says it’ll charge from zero to full in 70 minutes, which sounds about right since it holds twice the juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUICgy"&gt;These hybrid batteries are an impressive first step by manufacturers on the way to developing the tiny, high capacity, and eco-friendly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pure graphene batteries we’ve been promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qlY2HI"&gt;Until then, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D2ac4b231%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elecjet Apollo Ultra is priced at $65 on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; right now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lVoLnK"&gt;Black Friday sales are in full swing, and now some popular streaming services are starting to join the party. Through November 29th, both new and returning customers who qualify for the deal can enjoy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fgma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F24%2F22798649%2Fhulu-ad-streaming-plan-app-deal-macbook-air-m1-apple-airpods-sennheiser-sale-black-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month. Typically $7 per month — or $84 per year — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. While you’ll see an ad popping up every now and then with this plan, you can still access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on your TV, streaming box, tablet, laptop, console, and other devices. Two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream on this plan as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7fr8g"&gt;While newcomers to Hulu shouldn’t face any obstacles in signing up for the deal, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZwhoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pkl0rw"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 is selling for its best price yet. Right now, you can save $150 on all configurations. The specific model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;we liked in our review&lt;/a&gt;, which uses an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU paired with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, is just $1,550. Compared to its predecessor, we were particularly impressed by its improved battery life and the faster AMD CPU. Other things to like about this model are its fantastic keyboard and the 3:2 aspect ratio display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijKlae"&gt;For more discounts on the Surface Go 2 and other laptops, check out some early Black Friday deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796308/microsoft-black-friday-2021-deals-laptops-cyber-monday"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VrIY6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;If the Surface Laptop 4 is a little out of your budget — and you’re a Costco member — you can pick up Apple’s 13.3-inch MacBook Air with an M1 processor, which is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops around&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of costing $950 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/macbook-air-13.3%2522-%25e2%2580%2593-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%252c-7-core-gpu-%25e2%2580%2593-8gb-memory-%25e2%2580%2593-256gb-ssd-%25e2%2580%2593-space-gray.product.100688258.html"&gt;you can get it for $800&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price yet. This model has an eight-core Apple M1 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we gave the laptop a 9.5/10 (one of our highest scores &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;), praising the laptop’s fast performance and excellent battery life. It’s a good all-around option for many and a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even some very light gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZJpWg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bpG75h"&gt;Less than a day after offering Apple’s $179 third-generation AirPods for just $155, Amazon sadly sold out. Thankfully, however, Woot is now offering a similar discount, selling the newest pair of Apple’s true wireless earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAirpods3rdGeneration112321/https://www.woot.com/offers/new-apple-airpods-3rd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $170&lt;/a&gt; instead of $179. It may not be the $15 discount Amazon was offering, but it’s still one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet on the newly released AirPods, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;our pick&lt;/a&gt; for one of the best wireless earbuds you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="paMk4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7l0C0"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of earbuds that offers solid active noise cancellation (which the newest AirPods mentioned above don’t), Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;are a great pick&lt;/a&gt; with “sublime” sound. One of the few problems, though, is their usual $300 price. That’s twice as expensive as the likes of the AirPods, but at least with today’s deal, that is no longer the case. They’re selling for $197 when you pick up the black model. That’s just over a $100 discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfuBxa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xbAOoR"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are other notable deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GYBddk"&gt;Both new and returning customers can enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku"&gt;four months of a subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon’s eBook reading service, Kindle Unlimited, for just $5 instead of $40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ghnIWe"&gt;Walmart is taking $50 off of the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=VergeDeals112421&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Charge-4-NFC-Activity-Tracker-Black-Black%2F599342265&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Charge 4&lt;/a&gt;, selling it for $69 instead of $120. The fitness tracker comes with built-in GPS, as well as other perks, including contactless payment and Spotify controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jXyRDH"&gt;Amazon is offering the first discount on the latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tile-1-Pack-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible/dp/B09B2NYJ3T?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tile Slim tracker&lt;/a&gt;, which is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. Typically $35, you can buy it for $28 instead. This product launched last month, and it offers features like water resistance and the ability to locate your smartphone by using the tracker as a remote. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>What Peloton’s growing pains mean for at-home fitness</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person browsing Peloton classes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivY53ZRB3afMMGOXH8PpOlM9ApU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186886/akrales_170407_1569_0477.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GzdQ25"&gt;When gyms and fitness boutiques closed their doors in early 2020, it was fitness tech’s moment to shine. Stuck at home, people needed new ways to stay active — and for many, that meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup/22206745/2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place"&gt;stepping into the world of connected fitness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/nintendo-ring-fit-adventure-selling-out"&gt;impossible to find&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness influencers turned to Instagram to broadcast live workouts. Even big tech companies started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;getting into wearables&lt;/a&gt; or launching their own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;on-demand&lt;/a&gt; fitness services. But no one had a year quite like Peloton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUSMwW"&gt;Ironically, Peloton started 2020 as the butt of everyone’s jokes thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/3/20993432/peloton-new-commercial-horror-movie"&gt;terrible holiday commercial gone viral&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody was laughing a few short months later. When lockdowns began, Peloton started by offering a free 90-day trial to its app — no bike purchase necessary. By mid-2020, Peloton said it had 1.1 million subscribers and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-posts-first-ever-profit-as-pandemic-speeds-sales-11599776415"&gt;posted its first-ever profit&lt;/a&gt;. Amid heavy shipping delays caused by skyrocketing demand, Peloton slashed the price of its original Bike and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427003/peloton-new-treadmill-bike-plus-exercise-equipment-features-price"&gt;introduced two new products&lt;/a&gt;: the Bike Plus and a lower-cost treadmill. By the end of the year, it spent &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maybe-now-peloton-orders-wont-take-so-long-1845933064"&gt;$420 million to buy Precor&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s largest commercial fitness equipment makers. It kicked off 2021 by dropping another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;$100 million to fix shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; and yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451515/peloton-400-million-factory-ohio-treadmill-bikes"&gt;$400 million to build a factory in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. The millions it dropped in investment then bolstered rumors the company was working on new products ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/peloton-plans-armband-heart-rate-monitor-in-push-into-wearables"&gt;wearables&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-21/peloton-app-hints-a-rowing-machine-will-arrive-soon-report"&gt;rowers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nHbFD"&gt;Peloton was signaling it planned for a robust post-pandemic future. It seemed nothing could stop that momentum — at least, until a few months ago. Over the summer, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled both its treadmills&lt;/a&gt; following reports of several injuries and, in one instance, a child’s death. With the COVID-19 vaccines, restrictions were relaxed, and people began &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/americans-back-to-gyms-interest-in-at-home-workout-wanes-jefferies.html"&gt;returning in droves to brick-and-mortar gyms&lt;/a&gt;. Sales stalled, even as Peloton cut the price of its original bike down to $1,495. In a reversal of fortunes, Peloton recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/peloton-pton-to-report-fiscal-q1-2022-earnings-.html"&gt;reported a net loss of $376 million&lt;/a&gt; for Q1 2022, sending its stock into freefall the same day Planet Fitness reported it had exceeded expectations. Peloton CEO John Foley admitted in &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/events/event-details/peloton-interactive-1q22-earnings-call"&gt;an investor call&lt;/a&gt; that the company had misjudged how things could change after people started getting back to normal life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0iGic"&gt;In the past year, the Peloton brand has become a household name. It often acts as a stand-in for the entire connected fitness category — much like how some people use Fitbit to describe all fitness trackers. For better or worse, Peloton’s products and business model have served as a template for everyone else to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="RC2sUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But if everyone is copying Peloton’s playbook, it means they share the same pitfalls, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8kxVS8"&gt;Case in point, the influx of Peloton copycats. You’ve seen them before. The ones described as the “Peloton of their sport” because they target a different piece of gym equipment, slap a 20-inch touchscreen on it, and launch a competing on-demand service with leaderboards and peppy trainers. There are dozens of them, from more established at-home fitness brands like Mirror, Tonal, and Hydrow to more niche startups you’ve probably never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4YTqI"&gt;Each has modified Peloton’s formula to a different type of gym equipment and comes with its own celebrity investors and backers. Mirror was featured in the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/01/mirror-mirror-workout-wall/604699/"&gt;social media feeds of several actresses&lt;/a&gt; like Lady Gaga, Olivia Wilde, and Courtney Cox. Tonal has Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2021/09/lizzo-timberlake-rowing-hydrow.html?page=all"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2020/09/18/stephen-curry-enters-fitness-wars-with-investment-in-tonal-ai-home-gyms-110-million-round/?sh=19bb89843cd8"&gt;Steph Curry&lt;/a&gt;. Hydrow is backed by &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2021/09/lizzo-timberlake-rowing-hydrow.html?page=all"&gt;Lizzo and Justin Timberlake&lt;/a&gt;. There are also more obvious copycats, like Equinox’s SoulCycle Bike, iFit’s NordicTrack Commercial S22i Studio Cycle, and Echelon’s entire catalog of cheap bikes and treadmills. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman uses Tonal machine." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nCibx61xd7XDn7SEtaUMNyZ3o7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18352955/akrales_190725_3568_0138.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonal requires a 12-month commitment and a professional installation crew.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLtLw8"&gt;But if everyone is copying Peloton’s playbook, it means they share the same pitfalls, too. Beyond obvious issues like cost, limited living space, and fickle motivation, connected fitness has an ecosystem problem. Many of these companies severely handicap their expensive hardware if you don’t subscribe to a membership while also limiting their digital content to said hardware. For instance, Hydrow’s &lt;a href="https://support.hydrow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023166271-What-can-Hydrow-do-without-a-membership-"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; explicitly states that “[membership] is an integral part of the Hydrow experience and should not be considered an optional part of purchasing.” If you choose to &lt;a href="https://support.hydrow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039377051-Hydrow-Digital-Basic-membership-FAQs"&gt;subscribe to Hydrow’s app only&lt;/a&gt;, it won’t let you record metrics taken from another rower. You can’t even log into another Hydrow rower even though you’re a paying customer. Likewise, Mirror won’t even let you use its app unless you’ve bought the hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvZwp8"&gt;Linking hardware and software like this is meant to lock customers into one fitness ecosystem to the exclusion of all others. While most let you integrate your workout data with Strava, the hardware generally only lets you do one thing: stream one company’s workouts. You can’t download different entertainment apps or stream other workouts on a Peloton Bike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20801983/youtube-plex-web-browser-peloton-bike-treadmill-how-to-watch"&gt;unless you’re willing to jailbreak it&lt;/a&gt; and void the warranty. The SoulCycle Bike is the rare exception that includes Netflix and Disney Plus on top of its own content. The only problem is the Netflix and Disney Plus apps are locked behind the Equinox Plus paywall. You end up paying a premium for a piece of equipment that can only do one thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="VP31cw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The difference with connected fitness is these locked ecosystems exacerbate old problems and create new ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ENrdxz"&gt;With smaller players, you run the risk of losing a ton of money if the company shuts down. That’s what happened last year when Flywheel lost a patent dispute with Peloton over its leaderboards feature. One day, Flywheel owners found out their $1,999 bikes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145349/flywheel-bike-shut-down-email-user-reactions-peloton-trade-in"&gt;were bricked with no recourse&lt;/a&gt; other than to eat the loss or switch to Peloton. Flywheel may not end up as the only casualty either. Peloton isn’t afraid of the courtroom. It’s gone &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2021/07/09/scott-watterson-ifit-war-to-bring-down-peloton/?sh=66dc8e1c4953"&gt;toe to toe with iFit before&lt;/a&gt;. It also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783952/peloton-fitness-tech-echelon-ifit-nordictrack"&gt;filed two lawsuits against iFit and Echelon&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the two companies’ products cribbed its on-demand content. On top of calculating premiums, evaluating the digital content, and ensuring your home meets installation requirements, consumers also have the headache of researching whether a company’s fitness ecosystem is built for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXyM0N"&gt;Most of these issues aren’t new. Single-use fitness equipment has been around for decades, taking up space in your home as expensive, glorified coat racks once your New Year’s resolutions peter out. The difference with connected fitness is these locked ecosystems exacerbate old problems and create new ones. Selling a Peloton is harder than selling a regular stationary bike. (Forget Tonal, which must be &lt;a href="https://knowledge.tonal.com/s/article/Installation-Requirements"&gt;installed into your home’s wall studs&lt;/a&gt; by a professional crew.) Warranties, pre-paid subscriptions, and financing plans may not be transferable or refundable. Moving the devices to another location is an even greater hassle, thanks to the giant, fragile touchscreens. You may not even be able to place the device where you want due to Wi-Fi and other installation requirements. Worst of all, even if you figure this all out, you’re still on the hook for monthly fees for as long as you have the device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBQwML"&gt;Right now, experts seem to think connected fitness is headed down the same post-pandemic path as remote work. As life returns to normal, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/peloton-or-the-gym-why-decidewhat-this-means-for-fitness-companies.html"&gt;consumers will likely adopt a hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of going to the gym &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; working out at home when it’s most convenient. But while investors rightly deduced that increased competition has led to Peloton, Hydrow, Mirror, and Tonal &lt;a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/at-home-fitness-brands-are-investing-more-in-marketing-as-competition-heats-up/"&gt;ramping up their marketing spending&lt;/a&gt;, no one has answered why single-use equipment, limited ecosystems, and expensive subscriptions are worth risking for untested fitness startups. Even Peloton is stumbling despite its devoted community base, &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee"&gt;impressive 92 percent yearly retention rate&lt;/a&gt;, and strong ecosystem of products and services. As the leader in the field, Peloton can withstand a few short-term setbacks. But if its competitors can’t sort out this ecosystem problem, it doesn’t bode well for its army of copycats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmCIti"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp on the web gets a built-in sticker maker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Eilv8mNBXbXq9I_cx2v15v8BZI=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186670/WhatsApp_Sticker_Tool_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sticker maker lets you crop out a background, and add extra flourishes like emoji.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n7epty"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/"&gt;WhatsApp’s web version&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with a built-in custom Sticker Maker, which lets you turn ordinary images from your computer into stickers that can be sent via the messaging service. To access it, click the paperclip (attachments) icon, select Sticker, and then pick an image to upload. As well as WhatsApp’s web version, the feature is also coming to its &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download"&gt;Desktop apps&lt;/a&gt; in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI5jGo"&gt;Once uploaded, images can be edited to turn them into the perfect sticker. An outline can be drawn around a picture’s subject to cut out the background, and images can also be cropped (though always in a square aspect ratio). Emoji, text, and additional WhatsApp stickers can also be layered on top of your sticker creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzn3Q"&gt;Being able to make your own stickers on WhatsApp is nothing new, and there are a &lt;a href="https://www.techcommuters.com/best-sticker-maker-apps-for-android-and-ios/"&gt;whole range of third-party apps available on iOS and Android&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the task. But it’s a convenient feature to have built directly into the service’s desktop and web versions, especially since they let you edit images with the precision of a mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KxZYQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpL89u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is offering Xbox Series X bundles direct to ‘valued customers’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0yOjEmjhUYux2W2bCKiEw-IyKs=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186650/twarren_xboxseriesxhandson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzT75O"&gt;If you’re hunting for an Xbox Series X, you might want to check your email inbox. Microsoft has been emailing out special links over the past week to the Microsoft Store, that let you directly order an Xbox Series X bundle. Microsoft says it has a “limited supply of Xbox Series X bundles” that are available to “valued Microsoft customers” in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zFHJB"&gt;The emails are addressed to Microsoft Store customers, and bundles are available on a first-come and first-serve basis. Microsoft is limiting orders to one bundle per order, or two bundles per 30-day period. The links to order a bundle are unique and tied to a Microsoft Account, and don’t always guarantee that stock is available for a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n4IiKS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft has been offering Xbox Series X bundles (with a game and extra controller) to “valued Microsoft customers” this week. Emails include a unique link to purchase a bundle &lt;a href="https://t.co/dEHlR0rsZ7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dEHlR0rsZ7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1463250768681742344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hv90iU"&gt;A wide range of “valued Microsoft customers” seem to be receiving the emails, and it could be a way for Microsoft to ensure some of its stock isn’t heading into scalpers hands. The main requirement seems to be that you’ve shopped online at the US Microsoft Store before, and perhaps even purchased Xbox-related software or hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxo0eI"&gt;If you’re lucky enough to receive an invite to purchase a bundle, you won’t be able to buy just the console itself. Microsoft is bundling a game and an additional controller with this offer, and you can pick between &lt;em&gt;Madden 22&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hasbro Family Fun Pack&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Insurgency Sandstorm&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2 Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6n58a"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;warned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Xbox Series X supply will be constrained into 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted various companies for more than 18 months now. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt; of vehicles, and it’s been near impossible to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJp8YC"&gt;Scalpers have also been making a bad situation worse by driving up prices. PS5, Xbox Series X, and GPU street prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;are still through the roof&lt;/a&gt;, with an Xbox Series X selling for an average of $856 on eBay right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The newest game on Netflix is actually an old game  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TGK7OUp7tRDi6m7SvXjX8Znbeo=/0x1:2153x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186514/Y4vlfOfnJ5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ylZugz"&gt;The latest game to come to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;Netflix’s fledgling gaming service&lt;/a&gt; is the racing title &lt;em&gt;Asphalt Xtreme&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-including-the-return-of-gamelofts-asphalt-xtreme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because the mobile game was originally released in October 2016 but was subsequently pulled from app stores at the end of September 2021. A trailer for the game released on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmPVO0j03TU"&gt;Netflix’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; notes that it will be available “exclusively” for the service’s subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDyuvw"&gt;It’s an interesting launch that sees Netflix’s gaming service borrowing from its video streaming playbook. Rather than exclusively releasing all-new, original titles, Netflix seems to be bulking out its catalog by licensing previously released games. Same as how Netflix’s video catalog contains all-new shows like &lt;em&gt;Lupin &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alongside classics like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n4KVdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple Arcade has used a similar approach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NexX0C"&gt;Other game subscription services have struck a similar balance. This year, Apple Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623498/apple-arcade-castlevania-grimoire-of-souls"&gt;added the game &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously seen a &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2019/01/31/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-global-release/"&gt;limited release in Canada in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but which was &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;discontinued the following year&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple’s game service also offers brand new titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So too does Xbox Game Pass include a mix of new and old games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKwSmF"&gt;If you’re a Netflix subscriber and want to check out the mobile games available on its service, you can find them listed in its regular iOS and Android apps. Be aware, though, that in order to actually play them you’ll be linked out to each platforms’ app store to download each game. On iOS, this approach is due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s strict App Store rules&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent developers from letting users download or stream a catalog of games within their existing apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGqhpi"&gt;Thankfully, the process is about as seamless as it can be given the circumstances — I just tried downloading a Netflix game on an iPhone where I’m already signed in, and I didn’t have to go through a separate login process. Available games include &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/stranger-things-1984/id1574739824"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stranger-things-3-the-game/id1574824199"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shooting-hoops/id1585735348"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/teeter-up/id1585735663"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/card-blast/id1586360462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hellofrostypop/status/1461009547447783429"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowling Ballers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new title that was released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5bJX0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-including-the-return-of-gamelofts-asphalt-xtreme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Asphalt Xtreme&lt;/em&gt; is gradually rolling out to users globally, and will come to Netflix subscribers in the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWSOus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter updates iOS app to stop tweets disappearing mid-read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSWyIm9tp16n4sbh7n3M4x7UId0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186397/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQ6EGz"&gt;Twitter has updated its iOS app to prevent those annoying situations where tweets disappear as you’re trying to read them, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. “Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UjaGU"&gt;The updates made on iOS follow similar improvements made on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785094/twitter-auto-refresh-timeline-stop-tweets-disappear"&gt;web version of Twitter last week&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter explained that tweets can disappear when replies are being added to an ongoing conversation, because this would push existing tweets up the timeline. “We know it’s a frustrating experience, so we’re working on changing it,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hoFeZc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve made some updates on iOS to prevent Tweets from disappearing mid-read. Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bwiz"&gt;The changes have come during an unusually busy year for Twitter, where it’s been adding major new features on an almost monthly basis. Earlier this month it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783594/twitter-blue-nuzzel-top-articles-ios-arrivial-top-articles"&gt;new summary of popular articles&lt;/a&gt; for subscribers of Twitter Blue, a paid service that itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;only launched in June this year&lt;/a&gt;. Other major new features to have been widely released this year include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753072/twitter-super-follows-subscription-ios"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740451/twitter-revue-subscribe-newsletter-tweet"&gt;new button&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the process of subscribing to newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4haKz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
