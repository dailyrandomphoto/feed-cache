    <title>1Password’s family plan is 50 percent off for Verge readers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xf5tok"&gt;1Password is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a big discount on a family subscription to its password managing software through Thursday, April 15th. Normally $5 per month, buying into this deal will get you &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14494353?sid=Verge1PasswordApril21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year’s worth of service for $2.50 per month&lt;/a&gt;, totaling $30 by the end of the year. Once the year is up, your monthly cost will go up to $5 per month if you choose to continue with the service. This deal is valid for new users only, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmzZQ0"&gt;This purchase will grant up to five people (not restricted to your household) with individual access to the service — which, in addition to managing their own passwords, lets each person store sensitive documents and info securely with 1GB of storage. You can read more about &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14464697?sid=VergeExclusive1PDeal040121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2Ffamilies%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 1Password Families plan right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Nvidia RTX 4090 video wins 2021’s best April Fools’ joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgeI0ZGTvLkz83PGGQWSPfXgONQ=/4x0:1813x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059979/rtx4090joke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The joke RTX 4090 card.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=268" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXi55P"&gt;April Fools’ Day jokes are usually lame and lack any real effort, but 20-year-old Kasper Andersen has risen to the occasion for 2021 to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0frNP0qzxQc"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 4090&lt;/a&gt;. The Danish hardware enthusiast loves to create homemade replicas of retro graphics cards, but his latest RTX 4090 project imagines a future where Nvidia’s card uses 1,000 watts of power, has a 12-fan design, and includes 48GB of VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSQ8f1"&gt;The video is a work of art, with subtle details like two power cords, RGB lighting, or the ridiculous GPU benchmarking tool that records more than 23,000 frames per second. My personal favorite is when the whole PC powers on and the desk starts wobbling, a Pepsi Max can tumbles by, and then the test rig swings around by itself and crashes into the monitor. It’s pure chef’s kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkxxHwj8FWgzqOgCxDfzfR_4mrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412972/fC6ccck.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=237" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andersen’s joke Intel Xe GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xVtyd6"&gt;If that’s not enough, wait until Andersen unveils the RTX 4090 Ti flagship with eight GPUs in SLI that “only takes up four PCIe slots.” Andersen has also created a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s13iFPSyKdQ"&gt;similar video for Intel’s Xe gaming GPU&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a GPU to CPU switch on the top, “which allows you to use the card as a motherboard.” There are plenty more fun videos and projects over at Andersen’s &lt;a href="http://captains-workspace.com/"&gt;Captain’s Workspace site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qym9l"&gt;Andersen’s shenanigans won’t make the RTX 4090 any more real than the constantly out-of-stock RTX 3080. But if you’re still trying to snag a new GPU, hopefully this video puts a smile on your face while you battle scalpers, stock notifications, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;GPU prices that are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad is $100 off at several retailers again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WjLpl9wmBHdz4PMZoSdR2Eboc-E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059965/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUYgym"&gt;With the right keyboard, you can turn your iPad into a functional laptop (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229046/ipados-ipad-magic-keyboard-software-limitations-trackpad-html-inspect-source"&gt;sort of&lt;/a&gt;). If you have been eyeing Apple’s Magic Keyboard but are waiting for a sale, today’s the day. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-iPad-Air-4th-generation-and-iPad-Pro-11-inch%2F984505060&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDailyDeals04012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the Magic Keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-gen iPad Air available for $199, $100 off its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRPUiq"&gt;If you own the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, don’t worry: you can buy the accessory at a discounted price, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736540284080851936#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $100 off the Magic Keyboard designed for this specific iPad, bringing the price down to just $249. Both Magic Keyboards include a set of backlit keys and a trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MbM10N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWiuI"&gt;Despite being three years old, the first-generation Microsoft Surface Headphones are still a good option for those looking for a pair of reasonably priced noise-canceling headphones. Usually $250, Woot is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://computers.woot.com/offers/microsoft-surface-headphones-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling them for $106&lt;/a&gt;, making them one of the best values in noise-canceling headphones available right now. If you order the Surface headphones through the Woot app, you’ll receive an additional 10 percent off your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kYLPHg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paJ861"&gt;Logitech’s G502 gaming mouse is one of the best on the market. Aside from the wired model being my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;personal favorite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus"&gt;primary computer mouse&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Cameron Faulkner thinks both versions of the G502 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;some of the best gaming mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the wireless variant, the G502 Lightspeed, for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$118 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get it for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flogitech-910-005565-g502-usb-lightspeed-wireless%2Fp%2FN82E16826197336%3FDescription%3DLogitech%2520G502%26cm_re%3DLogitech_G502-_-26-197-336-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726260149769003399#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$120 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htmnOS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cmk9"&gt;If you are in the market for a new laptop but were not interested in the MacBook Air deal we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/3/30/22358166/amazon-kindle-oasis-beats-headphones-apple-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale"&gt;the other day&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has discounted both storage configurations of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.

Both laptops include 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nier: Replicant is coming out at the perfect time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ES68a1E-mirPBaTcPwTxQxTv2yU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059892/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_BLACKSCRAWL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dMxOwX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t expected to be a hit. It was a sequel to an RPG that could charitably be described as a cult classic, and its time-spanning story demanded a lot from players. Yet director Yoko Taro’s dark, poignant, and hilarious writing shone through, while the developers at PlatinumGames ensured the action felt great. It ended up selling more than 5 million copies, was ported to new platforms, and most recently was introduced to a brand-new audience through Xbox Game Pass. That makes now the ideal time to dig into its predecessor — which just so happens to be getting a remaster later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuB3ja"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; launched in Japan in 2010, and it was actually split into two versions: the main game on PS3, called &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gestalt &lt;/em&gt;for the Xbox 360, which starred an older lead that Square Enix hoped would better appeal to Western audiences. The game was praised for its cryptic story and creative worldbuilding, but it also received plenty of complaints about dated graphics and clunky controls. The result was that it never really caught on with a big audience. And that’s where the new version — officially titled &lt;em&gt;Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139… — &lt;/em&gt;comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GIcEKJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1899294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo0XLE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; appears to make the PS3 version the canonical story, and it’s centered on a brother who has to traverse a post-apocalyptic landscape in search of a cure for a mysterious disease that is slowly killing his sister. (It also takes place thousands of years before &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, so while there are connections, the stories stand alone pretty well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noFenL"&gt;I didn’t play either of the original versions, so I can’t speak directly to the changes made. But after playing the first 12 hours, it’s giving me the same vibes as &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. For one thing, it’s incredibly weird. You’re accompanied by a magic talking book that fires spears made from the blood of your enemies, and the game constantly shifts in unexpected ways; sometimes a dungeon involves fighting giant monsters; other times, it’s a text adventure full of riddles. Taro also &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; to break the fourth wall, and &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; does this in myriad ways, from complaints about sidequests to a sequence where characters talked directly to a narrator. This is a video game that doesn’t pretend to be anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY8Bq2"&gt;There’s also a sadness that will be familiar to fans of &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. This is a story about death and loss, after all, punctuated by an incredible score from composer Keiichi Okabe. The muted color palette and world full of beautiful, crumbling ancient ruins only add to this feeling. There’s also a richness to what at first appears to be a fairly typical fantasy setting. Some of my favorite moments so far included visiting a desert town where its masked inhabitants live by a strict list of literally thousands of rules and learning how to communicate with them, or visiting a library and hearing people marvel at how much ancient civilizations used to write things down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GC1XY8amNnxbSkh9y9weCp1KDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411707/NieRReplicant_ver122_COMBAT1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bgFK8H"&gt;It also just feels great. Like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, the action is relatively simple but fast and satisfying. You can pull off incredible moves just by mashing the attack button and rolling around, while your book companion handles ranged attacks, almost like a gun-firing drone. It’s the kind of game where I don’t ever avoid battles because they’re so fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWfvb3"&gt;But that’s not to say it’s exactly like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. While the tone and gameplay are familiar, it is slightly clunky. The sidequests are full of interesting stories, but the ones I’ve played so far are pretty dull fetch quests. Running around collecting lizard tails is not a good time, no matter how beautiful the setting is. Similarly, while I love that the game tries new things, it doesn’t always work; the handful of frustrating platforming sequences are just one example. &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; definitely isn’t as polished as its sequel, even in this new and updated form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWA6XG"&gt;While the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t a breakout success, it’s clear that developer Square Enix had faith in it. Back in 2017, just before &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt; launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13653128/nier-automata-square-enix-preview-yosuke-saito-interview"&gt;producer Yosuke Saito told me&lt;/a&gt;: “We thought that we really needed to let this new [intellectual property] grow and get bigger.” After spending some time with &lt;em&gt;Replicant,&lt;/em&gt; I understand why. Despite the rough edges, it’s a fascinating experience that I can’t wait to dig into even further — expect much more on the game later this month in my full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRarTm"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nier: Replicant &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on April 23rd on the PS4, Xbox One, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How your gas stove sparked a battle over climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mM7LTx7OA918VXMm-kOdhZUzC0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059825/Thumb_Textless__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TH68Fu"&gt;Gas stovetops have become a proxy battleground for the future of the planet. Some cities are trying to cut down their greenhouse gas emissions by getting rid of gas hookups in new construction. But the natural gas industry isn’t going down without a fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOTaqd"&gt;Pro-gas &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/how-the-fossil-fuel-industry-convinced-americans-to-love-gas-stoves/"&gt;marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have most successfully waged its war in the kitchen, promoting gas stoves as superior to electric ranges. That’s made it more difficult for cities like Seattle to pass mandates that would limit the use of gas in homes and buildings. What’s at stake in this fight is cities’ ability to cut down their greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw24Nz"&gt;Further complicating things, the gas industry has, for decades, framed itself as a “cleaner” alternative to fossil fuels like coal and oil. “We should probably discuss the name of it: ‘Natural gas.’” says Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the nonprofit Building Decarbonization Coalition in California. “It has been perhaps one of the most successful marketing campaigns that we’ve seen from a large industry to call what is really a dangerous pollutant, something natural.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQfGfv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The science that’s given us a new perspective on natural gas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIz5WX"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has chipped away at that all-natural image. It turns out that the process of extracting natural gas and getting it to people’s homes can do serious damage to the climate because it belches out so much methane. Methane is a super potent greenhouse gas with even more power to heat up the planet than carbon dioxide. What’s more, gas stoves can also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/5/7/21247602/gas-stove-cooking-indoor-air-pollution-health-risks"&gt;affect air quality&lt;/a&gt; inside the home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTT5CL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; dove into the science that’s given us a new perspective on natural gas. And we explore what this tussle over stovetops might mean for our homes and the environment.

    <title>Caterpillar is bringing its newest rugged phone to the US for $699</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohv_sJx9yqXWNzAhpUUVI6kRuXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059447/cat_s62_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An integrated thermal imaging camera is a central feature on the S62.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mI8RHq"&gt;The Cat S62 Pro — and that’s Cat as in Caterpillar, the construction company — is now available in the US. The rugged smartphone is the latest device to feature Cat branding (it’s technically a product of licensee Bullitt Group) and builds on its predecessors’ integrated thermal camera capabilities. It’s designed with construction and industrial workers in mind,  and at $699, it’s a more attractively priced follow up to 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039758/thermal-camera-caterpillar-s61-update-s60-smartphone-android-price"&gt;S61&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted in the US at $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tQ7qG"&gt;Introduced last summer for sale in the UK, the S62 Pro features solid (if not super competitive) phone specs, which isn’t guaranteed in the rugged phone class. You’ll get a 5.7-inch 1080p display, a Snapdragon 660 processor with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,000mAh battery. But unlike mainstream midrange devices launching now, you won’t get 5G connectivity or Android 11 pre-installed; it ships with Android 10 and Cat says it will provide an update to 11. While the S62 Pro is significantly less expensive than its predecessor, it no longer offers the air quality and distance measurement sensors, and uses a slightly smaller battery (compared to 4,500mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cat Phones S62 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9w7SZ13qLHkZKeaeDZSIFj2S2M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411956/cat_s62_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1f4rhd"&gt;That’s the boring stuff. The exciting bits that the S62 Pro has to offer include its marquee feature: a built-in Flir thermal imaging camera with four times as many thermal pixels as its predecessor. The phone offers new modes that allow users to adjust and blend overlaid information from the standard 12-megapixel camera, providing more context to the thermal image. There’s also an option to set an alarm that will notify you when a certain temperature level is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Lgww6"&gt;As for its rugged credentials, the S62 Pro is rated at IP68 and IP69: the first indicates that it’s safe to submerge in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, the second that it can withstand high pressure spray. The company says it’s been tested against even harsher conditions than this, but is warrantied to the level of those official IP ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UdOXrH33qslNvSdecVI7V2Jm4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411957/cat_s62_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S62 is built to withstand harsh work environments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQnKfY"&gt;It can withstand drops of up to six feet onto a steel surface, and its Gorilla Glass 6 screen is bolstered by an additional factory-fitted screen protector. The S62 Pro also meets requirements of the MIL-STD-810 military standard, including vibration and thermal shock resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCjmVl"&gt;The S62 Pro isn’t currently available through any of the major US carriers, but is being offered unlocked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catphones.com%2Fen-us%2Fcat-s62-pro-smartphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22360767%2Fcaterpillar-s62-pro-us-availability-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Cat phones&lt;/a&gt; and third parties including Amazon and Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine joins satellite internet firm Viasat’s board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine Testifies Before Senate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUV6tLc5r4luY71Fwi0oDLQkBeg=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059456/1228805110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJF1i"&gt;Former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine is joining space-based broadband firm Viasat’s board of directors as his latest post-NASA gig, after joining a space-focused private equity firm in January. Wading into the world of satellite internet, he says he’s concerned about the digital divide and the future of humanity, and he wants to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6NgmL"&gt;“When I left NASA I had a lot of different phone calls and texts on what I should be doing next or what I could be doing next,” Bridenstine tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. A mentor, he said, suggested he reach out to companies he’s interested in, so he emailed Viasat’s cofounder and executive chairman Mark Dankberg and asked if they need any help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0F10"&gt;“There’s a digital divide and we need to close that,” the former Congressman and NASA chief said, adding that he thinks Viasat’s approach of beaming internet from long-distance orbits with massive, high-throughput satellites is the right plan. He said he was also attracted by the company’s goal of cutting internet costs — almost invoking a mantra similar to the one he repeated non-stop at NASA about cutting costs of astronaut rides to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNmu6J"&gt;“I mean, ultimately, if we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WBWYu7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...If we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iwMI9"&gt;Southern California-based Viasat, a longtime provider of internet from space, plans to launch its technologically complex but long-delayed trio of internet satellites, called ViaSat-3, in roughly six-month intervals beginning in the first quarter of 2022. From super high orbits, those three satellites will shower the world with broadband internet at a throughput capacity of one terabyte per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEp1tM"&gt;Smaller satellites in lower orbits, and in larger swarms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22350643/oneweb-spacex-racing-broadband-internet-arctic-military"&gt;are all the rage&lt;/a&gt; in satellite broadband these days, where the their proximity to Earth reduces the time it takes for internet signals to beam into homes and businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt; constellation is growing rapidly, with over 1,300 satellites launched to space since 2019. Jeff Bezos’s Amazon is planning its own constellation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;Project Kuiper&lt;/a&gt;. Both constellations are multi-billion-dollar undertakings, an investment that has sent other companies into bankruptcy. Viasat also has plans to send 300 internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCYrNu"&gt;For Viasat, bringing Bridenstine on board will help the company get an edge in “space systems and network technology globally,” Dankberg said in a statement, adding that “Jim is also an ardent proponent of preserving safe access to space via proactive measures to protect the space environment and contain orbital debris.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXlbBZ"&gt;Bridenstine wasn’t sure how demanding the new job will be, but he’ll partake in Viasat’s quarterly board of director meetings and possibly its annual shareholder meetings. “But if there are other areas where I can either fill gaps or provide support during the course of the year, I have no doubt that Viasat will probably be giving me a call,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFaed0"&gt;Less than a week after leaving office on January 20th, when President Biden was sworn in, Bridenstine joined aerospace and defense private equity firm Acorn Growth Companies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forced to offer Russian iPhone users local apps at setup thanks to new law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZkFJaQkba3BLqSfK6QLRtsj_sw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059430/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eRTAWg"&gt;iPhones purchased in Russia now show a list of Russian-made apps at startup, thanks to a new law which comes into effect today, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The prompt is part of the standard iPhone setup process, appearing after the user has selected other options like whether to allow Location Services or App Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FC5mg"&gt;“In compliance with Russian legal requirements, continue to view available apps to download,” the dry text reads, before showing a short list of just shy of a dozen apps. These include various Yandex apps, an email app from Mail.ru, a video live streaming service called OK Live, and popular Russian social network VK. A “Get” icon appears next to each app, giving the user a shortcut to install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="du1KVB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is how it looks in the actual setup. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QOUwwIGSnx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QOUwwIGSnx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Khaos Tian (@KhaosT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1377476353633624070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUaQhd"&gt;The prompt comes in response to a Russian law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;originally passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; requiring manufacturers to pre-install Russian-made software on devices sold in the country. It covers smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, laptops, and desktop computers. According &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-technology-software/russian-law-requires-smart-devices-to-come-pre-installed-with-domestic-software-idUSKBN2BO4P2?il=0"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the law is part of a broader attempt by Moscow to reduce its dependence on foreign companies as well as gain more control over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcv9fv"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Apple agreed to comply with the law&lt;/a&gt; by giving users the option to install Russian-made apps at startup. It’s a notable concession from the company, which typically maintains tight control over the setup process of its devices. However, Apple has been willing to make changes in apparent attempts to comply with Russia’s local laws in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changing maps&lt;/a&gt; to show Crimea as Russian territory and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;removing a gay pride watch face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaWGyK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that the big beneficiaries of the new law look set to be Yandex and Mail.ru. But in a statement last month a Russian official said that alternative apps will be included if they prove popular with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqbpt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kG06a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s AI reservation service Duplex is now available in 49 states</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DPYKyDFqrOoMsgWtur8-ks_PnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059361/akrales_180508_2553_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duplex uses AI to make phone reservations through Google Assistant. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lk8DGV"&gt;More than two years after it initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17508728/google-duplex-assistant-reservations-demo"&gt;began trials&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s AI-powered reservation service Duplex is now available in 49 US states. This looks like it’ll be the limit of Duplex’s coverage in the US for the time being, as Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has no timeline to launch the service in the last hold-out state — Louisiana 	— due to unspecified local laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdpyno"&gt;Adapting to local legislation is one of the reasons Duplex has taken so long to roll out across the US. Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s had to add certain features to the service (like offering a call-back number for businesses contacted by Duplex) to make it legal in some states. In others, it’s simply waited for legislation to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HS5PX3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has had to adapt duplex to local laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXecms"&gt;The new milestone of 49 states was &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/30/google-duplex-expands-to-43-us-states-coming-to-non-pixel-devices-soon/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AndroidPolice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on a Google &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7690269#zippy=%2Cavailability-in-the-united-states"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; that lists Duplex’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3u7Yi"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;wowed audiences&lt;/a&gt; when it first unveiled Duplex at its 2018 I/O conference. As a feature of Google Assistant, Duplex uses AI to call local businesses, making reservations at restaurants and hairdressers on your behalf using a realistic-sounding artificial voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiXCrv"&gt;But as is often the case with tech demos, Google promised more than it could deliver. In 2019 it was revealed that 25 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/technology/personaltech/ai-google-duplex.html"&gt;Duplex&lt;/a&gt; calls are made by humans, and that 19 percent of calls started by the automated system have to be completed by people. In our own reporting, we found that restaurants often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18538194/google-duplex-ai-restaurants-experiences-review-robocalls"&gt;confused Duplex&lt;/a&gt; with automated spam robocalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNcyL"&gt;It’s not clear what percentage of Duplex calls are made by AI now, but the service can’t have been taxed by too many restaurant reservations during pandemic lockdowns. As businesses begin to open up again this year, it’ll be interesting to see if Duplex can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is relaxing some rules about ads on drug-related videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dY9SugOhPM8_9K-37U6fssO83fQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059189/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ds6gTM"&gt;From this month, Google is updating some of its YouTube ad guidelines about drug-related videos. In a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9725604?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/even-youtube-is-chilling-out-on-weed-1846594023?rev=1617228974804"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it’s “expanding monetization on educational, documentary or news content that may include violent interactions with law enforcement, recreational drugs and drug-related content, or sensitive events.” The update means more drug-related videos should be eligible to have ads placed next to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkRkDn"&gt;You can see the exact changes by comparing a backup of YouTube’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210324202410if_/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;old content guidelines from last month&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;guidelines that are live now&lt;/a&gt;. The guidelines break down drug-related content into three categories: videos where uploaders can turn ads on, videos where ads should be turned off, and videos where they can be turned on “but only brands who opt in will run ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9JYqm9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As New York becomes the sixteenth state to legalize use of marijuana&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jBfOCG"&gt;The biggest change is a new bullet point that’s appeared in the first section, covering videos where ads can be turned on. This now covers videos focusing “on the purchase, fabrication, or distribution of drugs, such as the fabrication of home-made opioids” and “news reports about cannabis farms” that do not glorify drug use. Previously, advertisers had to opt-in to run ads against this kind of content, restricting the amount of ad revenue they could make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bslg7s"&gt;There are also a couple of bullet points that have disappeared entirely from YouTube’s list of videos where ads have to be turned off altogether. These are videos “focusing on drug consumption (including its effects) without educational or documentary context,” or which contain “promotion of regulated legal drugs or substances that can induce a high (e.g. cannabis and derivatives THC and CBD).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ5S2"&gt;Although these exact descriptions haven’t been added to any of the other sections, YouTube has slightly amended the wording in its section describing opt-in advertiser content, which now covers “content focusing on the display or effects of drug consumption; or the creation or distribution of drugs or drug paraphernalia in a comedic, non-educational, or non-documentary context.” The exact status of content around legal highs is less clear, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk6SP"&gt;The individual changes are minor, but they should make it easier for YouTube creators to approach the topic of drugs in their videos without worrying about ad revenue. They reflect a broader acceptance of drugs in the United States that include New York recently becoming the sixteenth state to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360455/new-york-marijuana-legalization-conviction-expungement"&gt;legalize the recreational use of marijuana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
