    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12vbn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m salivating over this new four-volume Philip K. Dick collection by the Folio Society</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW-TE6zanU9vW-QmRFobZxA0Kuo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100273/maxresdefault.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eugdg6"&gt;The Folio Society has released a &lt;a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/uk/the-complete-short-stories.html"&gt;limited-edition, four-volume set&lt;/a&gt; of Philip K. Dick’s collected short stories and I am seriously considering selling my plasma to buy a copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Yux"&gt;Each volume is bound in fluorescent colors, with 2,560 pages of text containing some 118 stories. There are 24 illustrations by 24 different artists, and the set itself has a theme inspired by the symbols found on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards"&gt;Zener cards&lt;/a&gt; — famously used throughout the 20th century to test for telepaths (mind-reading being a recurrent theme in Dick’s fiction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPpBC"&gt;The collection is absolutely stunning, like so many special editions by The Folio Society, but has a hefty price-tag of £495 ($679). There are also only 750 copies available to buy and it looks like they’re selling out quick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUBEEz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfLlxcY4F6w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0Ggf8"&gt;Philip K. Dick is an undisputed titan of science fiction, and I’ve long been a particular fan of his short stories. Not just because they contain some of the genre’s most iconic tales but because they also offer a capsule history of Dick himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EqPMmR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Philip K. Dick’s short fiction tells the story of his career as a writer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8tirnG"&gt;He was famously prolific as a writer, and lived at a time when it was possible to earn a decent living pumping out quick fiction hits. He published four stories in 1952 and then accelerated to publish 30 in 1953. (His love of amphetamines also contributed to this prolific output.) A sense of writing as drudgery bleeds into Dick’s stories, which often feature resentful toilers, like the tire regroover in &lt;em&gt;Our Friends from Frolix 8&lt;/em&gt; who takes bald, worn-out tires and carves fresh grooves into them with a red hot iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ02LR"&gt;Despite the grinding nature of the work, Dick’s fiction is endlessly imaginative. His short stories are still being retold today, and are particularly beloved by Hollywood. “We Can Remember it for You Wholesale” became 1990’s &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;; the 1956 short “The Minority Report” was turned into the 2002 Tom Cruise blockbuster of the same name; while the  “Adjustment Team” became 2011’s &lt;em&gt;The Adjustment Bureau, &lt;/em&gt;and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FHZiaT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10437324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="e9IDBA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wD6TeIkBFg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vp8rrk"&gt;As we progress through Dick’s career into the ‘70s, and ‘80s his output slows. In 1974, Dick famously experienced a series of visions in which an entity that was perhaps God, but which he dubbed the Vast Active Living Intelligence System or VALIS, “fired a beam of pink light directly at him, at his head, his eyes.” His stories from this era, particularly his novels, consequently move away from standard sci-fi tropes into post-modern themes, delving into slipstreams of consciousness, alternate realities, and hidden, unbelievable truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz9obQ"&gt;Reading through Dick’s short fiction chronologically offers its own narrative: the story of this magnificent writer and thinker. The Folio Society’s new set looks like a fabulous accompaniment to this intellectual history. Now excuse me, I have some Googling to do about “infallible get rich quick schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYi3nU"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbQblv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung reportedly inks deal to buy OLED TV panels from rival LG Display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5U3314OuYNet2bMCJP9OA29F0z8=/120x0:1302x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100165/LG_OLED_TV_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fApiIr"&gt;Samsung Electronics is close to ordering millions of OLED TV panels from LG Display, according to &lt;a href="https://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?mmn_idx=2021040910490127790"&gt;new reports from &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210409000074"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/22L0NM8RQV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seoul Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials reportedly met recently to agree to the deal, which would see 1 million panels supplied to Samsung in the second half of this year, rising to 4 million panels next year. If the deal is finalized, it would be the first time Samsung has bought OLED panels from its South Korean rival and market leader. TVs with LG’s OLED panels consistently rate amongst the best in professional reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJYhP"&gt;Samsung exited the OLED TV market &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-tv/how-samsung-fell-behind-sony-and-lg-in-the-premium-tv-market-idUSKBN1I24K2"&gt;over half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. Today, LG Display supplies OLED panels to a variety of TV manufacturers including Sony, Vizio, and Hisense, as well as LG Electronics. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336883/lg-display-oled-panel-manufacturing-plant-tv-china-lcd"&gt;LG Display announced an expansion&lt;/a&gt; of its OLED production lines, and market research firm &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210409008400320?section=news"&gt;TrendForce says&lt;/a&gt; its production capacity is due to further increase in the second quarter of this year. &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt; reports that LG Display’s total OLED TV panel production capacity is around 8 million units this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzVJ5P"&gt;Today’s reports are the latest indication of Samsung’s shift away from LCD panels, which it currently uses across its television lineup. Even its QLED TVs still use LCD panels behind that quantum dot layer. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200859/samsung-display-ending-lcd-panel-production-quantum-dot-oled-south-korea-china-factories"&gt;Samsung Display announced&lt;/a&gt; it would stop producing LCD panels in the face of stiff price competition from Chinese competitors, however it &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-lcd-production-shut-down-postponed/"&gt;reportedly postponed this shutdown&lt;/a&gt; after the pandemic led to a rise in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3U4AX5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rising LCD prices are reportedly to blame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjw2Pd"&gt;While falling LCD panel prices were believed to be behind last year’s move, &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt; reports that the trend is reversing this year. LCD panels are reportedly growing more expensive, prompting Samsung to explore alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DGm5p"&gt;While Samsung Electronics plans to buy panels from LG Display, its own display division is believed to be working on Quantum Dot OLED (QD-OLED) TV panels. A report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2590"&gt;South Korean publication &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week says Samsung Display is currently working on a prototype TV using the technology, which will be sent to potential customers like Samsung Electronics after it’s produced in June. However, QD-OLED panel samples sent to Samsung Electronics in January was reportedly criticized for their low brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3xetE"&gt;QD-OLED isn’t the only new display technology on Samsung’s horizon. It recently commercialized a new display type called Micro LED, which uses an array of tiny self-emissive LEDs to produce an image. Although Samsung has released the technology in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-microled-opens-a-new-era-of-breathtaking-picture-quality-and-design"&gt;series of ultra-high end TVs&lt;/a&gt;, it’s believed to be years away from being affordable enough for mass-market sets. There are &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-develops-method-for-self-emissive-qled/"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on self-emissive quantum-dot TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLQLBN"&gt;When asked about the potential deal &lt;a href="http://it.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/04/09/2021040902225.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung Electronics Jong-Hee Han, who oversees the company’s display division, dismissed the reports as rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpx1zE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKeBsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airplane takes off a metric ton heavier than expected after computer error weighs adults as children</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disturbance of air traffic by drones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRXa7kDnpmHpMe3GpFA8rq2KZzE=/74x0:3638x2376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099955/1231725546.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Boris Roessler/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wh1FQZ"&gt;A flight from the UK to Spain took off with more than a metric ton of unexpected weight after a software error classified female passengers using the title “Miss” as children. This led to the flight’s load sheet estimating the weight of 38 female passengers as 38 kg or 77 pounds each, the standard weight for children, instead of 69 kg or 152 pounds, the standard weight used for female adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePt20H"&gt;The error was classified as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-boeing-737-8k5-g-tawg-21-july-2020"&gt;serious incident&lt;/a&gt;” by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) but did not affect the flight’s safety. Despite a discrepancy of 1,244 kg (2,743 pounds) between the expected and actual mass of the aircraft, the thrust used in takeoff by the pilot was only “marginally less” than what was required. “This meant the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised,” concluded the AAIB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="knLFYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This meant the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5A9bFR"&gt;The error was introduced to the software after the flight operator suspended operations for several months due to COVID-19 restrictions. During this time, it upgraded its IT systems, but in the country where the software was programmed, the honorific “Miss” is used for children while “Ms” is used for female adults. The error affected two more flights from the same operator that same day, July 21, 2020, before it was corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7ZxG3"&gt;According to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/09/tui-plane-serious-incident-every-miss-on-board-child-weight-birmingham-majorca?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the flight was operated by Anglo-German company Tui. In statement the company said: “The health and safety of our customers and crew is always our primary concern. Following this isolated incident, we corrected a fault identified in our IT system. As stated in the report, the safe operation of the flight was not compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF0be5uHxP1MU1ILYSxxsJAbT9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099875/akrales_190513_3338_0008_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKuZvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="32yjX7"&gt;“The #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage ... iMessage amounts to serious lock-in,” was how one unnamed former Apple employee put it in an email in 2016, prompting Schiller to respond that, “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLvPQo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWdybq"&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” was Federighi’s concern according to the Epic filing. Although workarounds to using iMessage on Android have emerged over the years, none have been particularly convenient or reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5gKJ"&gt;According to Epic’s filing, citing Eddie Cue, Apple decided not to develop iMessage for Android as early as 2013, following the launch of the messaging service with iOS 5 in 2011. Cue admits that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” so that “users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.” Evidently, such a version was never developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsUJV"&gt;Along with iMessage, Epic cites a series of other Apple services that it argues contribute to lock-in. Notably, these include its video chat service FaceTime, which Steve Jobs announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ"&gt;would be an open industry standard&lt;/a&gt; back at WWDC 2010. FaceTime subsequently released across iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it’s not officially available for any non-Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q968OH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEF7T5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imposters steal restaurants’ names in delivery app deception</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PU7a0"&gt;Ordering delivery through an app like DoorDash or GrubHub saves the trouble of cooking and lets you be a little picky — you can order from your favorite restaurant. But imagine receiving your food, sitting down to eat, and it tasting... &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. And then, following your gut, you learn that you’ve been duped by a fake, an imposter restaurant that stole its name. For many people ordering from two Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, that exact thing may have happened, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/On-Doordash-these-S-F-sushi-spots-look-like-16078920.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irTysa"&gt;One restaurant, now styled as an izakaya called Chome, originally opened for delivery and takeout in the former location of Blowfish Sushi. Except it didn’t bother to change the name, awning, or logo at the start. Chome, operating as if it were Blowfish Sushi, served sushi to people ordering through apps like GrubHub, Postmates, DoorDash, and Uber Eats using the identity of a restaurant that closed in December 2020. Before it closed, Blowfish Sushi had been serving its neighborhood for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GE5mv"&gt;Blowfish’s former owner, Jason Teplitsky, was not exactly thrilled. “How does someone decide to do something like this? Did they think we all got COVID and died?” Teplitsky tells the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-MTes26QnTrdE7PnbcyWWMjTak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430912/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.28.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Wagyumafia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real Wagyumafia is famous for its use of wagyu beef &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WyYK82"&gt;Another fake restaurant, SF Wagyumafia, shares the name of &lt;a href="https://www.wagyumafia.com/"&gt;a famous sandwich shop&lt;/a&gt; known for its $180 wagyu sandwich and locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. This San Francisco restaurant has no connection with the actual chain, according to the real Wagyumafia, but it was advertising the $180 sandwich. The fake was convincing enough to initially fool one food writer, the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes. When you’re ordering through an app without any real way to gauge what you’re getting into, what can you do but take a restaurant at its word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dPCu7"&gt;At first glance, both these restaurants might seems like &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;ghost kitchen schemes&lt;/a&gt; gone awry. They’re seemingly focused on delivery, readily accessible through the most popular apps, and of an unknown origin. But blatantly copying other well-known restaurants to the point that people mistake one for the other, or think a classic has suddenly reopened, seems more like straightforward fraud. The new “Blowfish Sushi” even registered as Blowfish with the city of San Francisco, which makes it seem like the owner knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvmEC3"&gt;Teplitsky and the original Wagyumafia are considering legal action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCALkR"&gt;In response to the concerns over both restaurants’ legitimacy, DoorDash and GrubHub have removed Wagyumafia and Blowfish Sushi from their listings,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/DoorDash-and-Grubhub-removed-imposter-S-F-sushi-16081842.php"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn’t able to find a listing for either restaurant on Postmates or Uber Eats, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyBNPb"&gt;DoorDash, Postmates, GrubHub, and Uber Eats either didn’t respond to our questions about how they verify restaurant listings in the first place, or weren’t able to tell us whether they have any specific protections to keep one restaurant from stealing another restaurant’s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xiig"&gt;GrubHub did reply with a generic description of its practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KsmjA0"&gt;We have no tolerance for misconduct or misuse of the Grubhub platform. We have a number of safeguards in place to prevent potentially fraudulent listings on our marketplace and we are constantly improving our processes and testing new features to prevent these situations. In the case of any listings that might be fraudulent, we immediately investigate and remove them from the marketplace if they’re in fact fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DW1LML"&gt;And DoorDash provided something similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="31h5RR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At DoorDash, we work to ensure that we are always offering the highest quality of service to merchants, Dashers and customers. We take these types of allegations seriously and we’ve suspended the Merchants from the platform as we investigate the matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0JO8Gg"&gt;In GrubHub’s case, it says fraud like this isn’t widespread, but says it’s unable to explain exactly how it prevents fraudulent listing because doing so would potentially make its methods no longer useful. Typically these companies check banking and tax information to setup payments, so there are some required details that could potentially corroborate a restaurant’s identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh67RE"&gt;Fake restaurants aren’t the only surprises potentially awaiting you in food delivery apps: some legitimate brands have also tried to entice diners by changing their name for delivery. Remember, that pizza you purchase from Pasqually’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-pizza-wings-new-menu"&gt;actually comes from Chuck E. Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG33Q2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 11:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from DoorDash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtmKaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch: Elon Musk’s Neuralink says this monkey is playing Pong with its mind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A monkey and his Pong" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HU0SB6icGNQO3h2JSn2c7Kj1ERk=/201x0:1452x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098959/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_5.53.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGGXWp"&gt;Neuralink, Elon Musk’s company focused on developing brain-machine interfaces, has posted a video to YouTube that appears to show a monkey navigating an on-screen cursor using only its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBKK7B"&gt;Pager, a 9-year-old macaque monkey, had a Neuralink implanted about six weeks before the video was shot, the video’s unnamed narrator says. He was first taught to play video games with a joystick for a banana smoothie reward, delivered through a metal straw. While he was doing this, the Neuralink device recorded information about which neurons were firing — learning, essentially, to predict hand movements by recording which regions fired. After learning the patterns, the joystick Pager used to play was disconnected from the computer. The monkey appears to go on playing the game using only his mind — playing a game of Pong with no joystick whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xhOZdb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neuralink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380315654524301315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jOnNl"&gt;This style of scientific release is unusual; ordinarily, videos like this are supplementary material to peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals. Those papers contain data that can be checked by other scientists. It’s believable that a monkey might play video games using a brain implant — after all, a paralyzed man has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/21/8639905/brain-control-robot-arm-paralyzed-quadriplegic"&gt;already used a robotic arm and a non-Neuralink brain implant to drink beer&lt;/a&gt;.  Pong is a classic of brain-machine interfaces — in 2006, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/science/13brain.html"&gt;Matthew Nagle did a similar feat with four days’ worth of training&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDoT4V"&gt;In July 2019, Musk said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot"&gt;a monkey had already been able to control a computer&lt;/a&gt; with its brain and the Neuralink implant. Since then, we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;seen demonstrations of the Neuralink technology in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Musk tweeted that Neuralink might let a paralyzed person tweet faster than a person using their thumbs on a smartphone. A later goal, he said in a follow-up tweet, will be to send signals from Neuralinks in the brain to Neuralinks in major body neural clusters, “thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: here’s how to set your Venmo feed to private</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/94MYrHJAyZdxX6objgbbvZj1zcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098920/akrales_171110_2136_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NFeYMI"&gt;Hello, yes, it has come to my attention that Matt Gaetz left his Venmo feed public and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; has used this public feed to &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gaetz-paid-accused-sex-trafficker-who-then-venmod-teen"&gt;report a salacious story&lt;/a&gt; about his transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75xmWU"&gt;Yeah, you read that right. His Venmo feed was&lt;em&gt; public&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXxXdf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A public Venmo feed, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;one with questionable transactions, is a powerful way to amass personal information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N9MeBL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-scary-reasons-you-should-make-your-venmo-account-private-2018-07-17"&gt;People have been warning&lt;/a&gt; about Venmo’s public feeds for quite some time. You can figure out a lot about a person by monitoring their financial transactions through Venmo! In Gaetz’s case, we found out he sent money — $900, in two transactions— to Joel Greenberg, who is accused of sex trafficking. The morning after Gaetz sent money, Greenberg sent three young women sums of money that totaled... $900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjg0Ot"&gt;I didn’t think this need to be said, but here we are: If you have a Venmo account, and you are a congressperson, please do me a solid and go check on your security settings. You might think, “Liz, why would you, a reporter, discourage transparency?” Well, because reporters aren’t the only ones who snoop. Next time it might be a state actor amassing damaging information! A public Venmo feed, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;one with questionable transactions, is a powerful way to amass personal information — who you spend time with most, what you do together, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf0Ola"&gt;Here’s how: Go to the Venmo app on your phone. Press on the hamburger menu. Then tap “settings.” Next, tap “privacy.” You will get three options and the one you want is “private” so that only you and the person you’re dealing with get to see the transaction. I guess you could set it to “friends” but you’re a US Congressperson, so you might have friends who’d leak to the press. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GmmVe"&gt;Now, you need to do something else: hide anything public from the past. Go to “privacy” and under “past transactions,” set everything to private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhNHvv"&gt;This is infosec 101! Please include this article in the next national security briefing. Clearly Congress needs to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHfKTG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Students of color are getting flagged to their teachers because testing software can’t see them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_GdzJe51wmRaLLwooBpDCERW1bs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098820/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrXZwN"&gt;Proctorio, a piece of exam surveillance software designed to keep students from cheating while taking tests, relies on open-source software that has a history of racial bias issues, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue was discovered by a student who figured out how the software did facial detection, and discovered that it fails to recognize black faces over half the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X4dJ"&gt;Proctorio, and other programs like it, is designed to keep an eye on students while they’re taking tests. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cham_omot/status/1364376131516854275"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; students of color &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allseeingKHAI/status/1304421435385851904?s=20"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikyo1506/status/1304441930772656128?s=20"&gt;have issues getting the software&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigLou_42/status/1308943917950398466?s=20"&gt;see their faces&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes having to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaniceWyattRoss/status/1364032597484056577"&gt;resort to extreme measures&lt;/a&gt; to get the software to recognize them. This could potentially cause the students problems: Proctorio will flag &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;them to instructors&lt;/a&gt; if it doesn't detect their face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iDk74f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The software failed to recognize black faces more than half the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCBHT8"&gt;After anecdotally hearing about these issues, Akash Satheesan decided to look into the facial detection methods that the software was using. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/the-duality-of-obfuscation-feat"&gt;He discovered that it looked and performed identically to OpenCV&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source computer vision program that can be used to recognize faces (which has &lt;a href="https://algorithmia.com/blog/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-software"&gt;had issues with racial bias in the past&lt;/a&gt;). After learning this, he ran tests using OpenCV and a data set designed to validate how well machine vision algorithms deal with diverse faces. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/proctorios-facial-recognition-is-racist"&gt;According to his second blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the results were not good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPy23_bKbLHttQtw6J1_i9V5Plk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430728/sjuwg8t.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graph: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://proctor.ninja/proctorios-facial-recognition-is-racist" target="_blank"&gt;Akash Satheesan, ProctorNinja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results testing the software Proctorio relies on were not good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSbt5L"&gt;Not only did the software fail to recognize black faces more than half the time, it wasn’t particularly good at recognizing faces of any ethnicity — the highest hit rate was under 75 percent. In its report, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; contacted a security researcher, who was able to validate both Satheesan’s results and analysis. Proctorio itself also confirms that it uses OpenCV &lt;a href="https://proctorio.com/licenses"&gt;on its licenses page&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn't go into detail about how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHGuGe"&gt;In a statement to Motherboard, a Proctorio spokesperson said that Satheesan’s tests prove that the software only looks to detect faces, not &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;recognize the identities associated with them&lt;/a&gt;. Well that may be a (small) comfort for students &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7wxvd/students-are-rebelling-against-eye-tracking-exam-surveillance-tools"&gt;who may rightly be worried about privacy issues&lt;/a&gt; related to proctoring software, it doesn't address the accusations of racial bias at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R51cYl"&gt;This isn’t the first time Proctorio has been called out for failing to recognize diverse faces: the issues that it caused students of color were &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/02/01/u-illinois-says-goodbye-proctorio"&gt;cited by one university&lt;/a&gt; as a reason why it  would not renew its contract with the company. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/senator-more-transparency-is-needed-by-exam-proctoring-tech-firms/"&gt;called out the company&lt;/a&gt; when talking about bias in proctoring software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laDlFp"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v8mx/coded-bias-netflix-documentary-ai-ethics-surveil"&gt;racial bias in code is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially distressing to see it affecting students who are just trying to do their school work, especially in a year where remote learning is the only option available to some. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another 500 million accounts have leaked online, and LinkedIn’s in the hot seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Multinational Companies Based In Dublin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bCNDv2blJTC-LlWn845rVL5Els=/0x0:5991x3994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098647/1230866122.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGeGCY"&gt;You might still be reeling from the news that personal information from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook accounts&lt;/a&gt; has been made freely available online. But now there’s &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; huge batch of people’s data floating around the web — including data from LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social network confirmed. And the potential scope of the leak is huge: an individual selling the data on a hacker forum claims it was scraped from&lt;em&gt; 500 million&lt;/em&gt; LinkedIn profiles, &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/news/stolen-data-of-500-million-linkedin-users-being-sold-online-2-million-leaked-as-proof-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6uidu"&gt;In a purported sample of two million of the profiles for sale, LinkedIn members’ full names, email addresses, phone numbers, genders, and more were visible, &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt; found. LinkedIn, however, says the data includes information from many places and wasn’t all scraped from the professional-focused social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GLmhG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No private member account data from LinkedIn was included”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7q3K79"&gt;“We have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2021/april/an-update-from-linkedin"&gt;LinkedIn’s statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2aKnH"&gt;The company also contends that “no private member account data from LinkedIn was included” — which perhaps means the scraped data only includes information you’d be able to see on someone’s public page. LinkedIn insists that this was “not a LinkedIn data breach,” which would be technically true if the data was scraped rather than collected by a hacker penetrating LinkedIn’s systems, but doesn’t do much for users whose data is now being sold on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oQHcg"&gt;LinkedIn has yet to tell us if it will notify users whose data was in the dataset. (Facebook, if you were wondering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;doesn’t plan to inform users if they are one of the people whose data leaked.&lt;/a&gt;) If you want to check whether your email or phone number was part of the Facebook data leak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22367727/facebook-data-breach-haveibeenpwned"&gt;we have instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfxknv"&gt;Italy’s privacy watchdog has started an investigation into LinkedIn, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/linkedin-faces-italian-probe-after-users-data-is-hacked?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
