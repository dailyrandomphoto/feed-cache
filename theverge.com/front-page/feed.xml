    <title>Six things we learned about the Dead Space remake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sx1TrZiagZ5NiBLG_Lv0gyHmQik=/186x0:2241x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800131/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.55.22_PM_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNZXik"&gt;When EA announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586840/dead-space-remake-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;remaking &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t really clear what “remake” meant. Would the company be completely rebooting the beloved space horror series? Or would it be more like a remaster that upgraded the original’s 13-year-old graphics for the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and modern PCs? &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; studio EA Motive offered &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-gameplay-story-ps5-xbox-tech-details"&gt;a little bit more detail&lt;/a&gt; in interviews. But it was still hard to gauge what the remake was supposed to accomplish — since compared to remakes of ’90s games &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/25/22301179/system-shock-remake-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where designers are updating limited graphics and unfamiliar control schemes, &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; still feels eminently playable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhKW0w"&gt;Now, the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space &lt;/em&gt;remake’s developers have helped fill in some of the gaps. Motive held a &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1135081171"&gt;livestreamed Twitch session&lt;/a&gt; with members of the studio’s creative team, showing off extremely early footage demonstrating how the gameplay and level design could work. (We still don’t have a release date.) It confirmed a few things that will set the new game apart — but won’t necessarily transform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wPmZ1"&gt;Isaac Clarke will talk, and he’s getting a familiar voice actor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tuvHYI"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; starred engineer Isaac Clarke as a silent protagonist, but in the games since then, he’s been distinctively voiced by actor Gunner Wright. Today, Wright appeared on EA’s livestream to confirm that he’s coming back for the remake, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoqJAd"&gt;Wright’s return makes the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake sound more like a retroactive continuation of the original series, not a total reimagining of the franchise. EA also clarified that apparently Isaac will follow the same rules for speaking as a polite Victorian child.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot reading “Rules for Isaac’s dialogue. 1: Isaac will primarily only speak when spoken to. 2: Isaac will sometimes speak in a situation where it would feel weird if he remained silent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OULyzOZUsOYNKxN_p0kDb5v9Ltc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817855/E_IxKsMWEAIu2sr.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Buc3F"&gt;The second rule presumably exists to let him swear while stomping boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OT15TI"&gt;Dismemberment is going to be more complicated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Sah0F"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/8/31/22650616/the-dead-space-remake-cut-off-their-limbs"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; colleague Joshua Rivera details&lt;/a&gt;, simulated limb severing technology has advanced substantially since 2008. The livestream featured some very early renderings of the game’s necromorphs, and they seem affected by weapons in more detailed and convincing (these are still space knife zombies getting shot with plasma, so I won’t say “realistic”) ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Early Dead Space remake footage of shooting a necromorph" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MphLCTB9iMPgkE7OUb8JuqWyQps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818028/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_3.41.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJdfwF"&gt;The new system includes limbs whose flesh gets stripped off as you shoot them, helping you gauge how much damage you’ve done. It’s got weak points that feel more organic than the original game’s big glowing joints. It’s got more variety in how a given weapon affects a given necromorph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOFT2v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; weapons were already more varied than they sometimes get credit for. (If you go through the original game and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the sequel with just the plasma cutter, you’re legitimately missing out.) But the remake is clearly putting effort into meaningfully rebuilding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vYYfnq"&gt;Zero gravity actually lets you float&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VASCxH"&gt;The livestream’s generally scant in-game footage confirmed one substantial change: &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; remake will let you float in zero gravity (like you can in the game’s sequels), rather than having to leap between surfaces with your boots otherwise anchored to the “ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqNW6F"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; original weapons, its zero-G controls arguably get an unfairly bad rap. The levels are designed around jumping, and it’s weirdly satisfying to bounce from wall to wall. But adding free motion is a pretty natural tweak for the remake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8qtRYO"&gt;There are no microtransactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T3XSge"&gt;Did we already know EA isn’t bringing the widely hated microtransactions of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 3&lt;/em&gt; into the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space &lt;/em&gt;remake? &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-no-microtransactions"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;. Was it nice to hear Motive’s developers emphatically repeat that promise today? Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CDKy0V"&gt;A lore infusion is coming  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwO6m"&gt;Motive and EA previously hinted that they’d build out &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; story, and today, they gave more specifics about what that might mean. “We are not going to change the foundation of the story, because that story is really iconic,” said creative director Roman Campos-Oriola. “The things we want to enrich in terms of story or narrative, it’s really about the bigger universe of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;. We want to have more ties with what came after, whether it’s the books, whether it’s the anime, whether it’s &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 2&lt;/em&gt;, we want to put the original in a better way inside that broader universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcNlyO"&gt;That can apparently be done subtly through the environment, but some additions might be “a bit more,” says Campos-Oriola. &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; became an extremely lore-heavy series across three main games and a host of tie-in media, and the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake sounds like it will spend more time acknowledging that lore than changing it. The team didn’t discuss the game’s most beloved Easter egg, but after the livestream, it feels safe to say &lt;a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Peng_Treasure"&gt;there’s always Peng&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jv5mRl"&gt;The game aims to flesh out its side characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mASv43"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake also aims to provide more depth to the characters around Isaac, including Nicole Brennan, the girlfriend that he spends the game looking for. As Campos-Oriola puts it, “we want to give you the means to actually look for her, and more than look for her, learn what happened to her during the outbreak.” That might imply that &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; remake will involve a little more active player agency than the highly linear original, or maybe it’s just acknowledging that the original storyline &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem to periodically forget Nicole exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEYEEF"&gt;All the details above are still fairly vague. Motive showed off the remake in ways that highlighted its unfinished-ness, like putting enemies on a stage of untextured blocks, and a lot of the changes were just discussed theoretically. And it remains frustrating to see a new &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; game after EA unceremoniously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16491044/ea-visceral-games-shut-down-dead-space-studio-star-wars"&gt;shut down the series’ original studio&lt;/a&gt; Visceral Games. But for now, at least it’s becoming easier to tell what the remake’s creators are aiming at — whether or not they pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MotorTrend shows off Rivian’s electric adventure truck in detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeUODRLSDiQ7TLxXK81oGQBVxY4=/30x0:3258x2152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800062/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_2.55.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1mUm0I"&gt;Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck is finally set to ship next month after a series of delays — roughly three years after it debuted at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. Ahead of the launch, though, &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-first-drive-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;got to spend a handful of days&lt;/a&gt; with the all-electric adventure truck, and the team there came away impressed by its performance. What’s more, they offer one of the best looks at the R1T’s interior, which borrows as much from Tesla as it does from other high-end off-road-focused vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbtD4T"&gt;None of this is exactly surprising — Rivian has actually been quite open about the development of the R1T since its debut, regularly posting its own articles, photos, and videos along the way — but the truck features two large, crisp displays on the dashboard, In the preproduction version &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;tested, those screens were surrounded by a wood-grain dashboard with silver accents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hbgiS"&gt;There are just two physical buttons on the steering wheel, which resemble the scroll wheels Tesla employs in its cars. That means &lt;em&gt;a lot &lt;/em&gt;of the controls are routed through the touchscreen. Some people may not like that, though Tesla has proven that it’s not an approach that will hurt sales. But the R1T is supposed to be just as capable off-road as it is on the highway or city streets, and tapping a touchscreen while rumbling through the woods seems like it could get tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CZkCyi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Get ready to use the touchscreen a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TrvgPj"&gt;It looks like all of the R1T’s exterior storage compartments can be opened through the touchscreen, like the massive front trunk, the doors to the “gear tunnel” that sits between the cab and the bed, and the tonneau cover. The main touchscreen is also where you’ll be able to toggle between the R1T’s suite of drive modes or adjust the ride height. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DORGSm"&gt;Over the years, Tesla has sort of redefined what “luxury” means in a modern car — or at the very least, it has been able to find buyers who care more about technology and minimalistic design than they do about the kinds of traditional luxury touches found in something like a Mercedes-Benz. Rivian looks like it’s going to try to straddle those two worlds a bit with the R1T, with the added complexity of appealing to buyers who want to use its vehicles in truly rough settings. We won’t know how that plays out until the first customers receive and start using their trucks next month, but &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;seems to have stumbled on one potentially risky compromise: there are just two cupholders in the front seats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless gaming headset is slowly driving me up the wall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xf9z0Jl91ByIiMIj0j4XdHrzzw=/352x110:1562x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800002/arctis_pro_wl_white_livingroom_wide_4k_001.jpg__1920x1080_q100_crop_fit_optimize_subsampling_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless.&lt;/em&gt; | Image by Steelseries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3P3P4X"&gt;If you’re going to make the best product on the market, please go all the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwBZFN"&gt;Case in point: the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless is one of the best wireless gaming headsets ever made. In 2018, I tested it against every single competitor on the market (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1YZ4lqpnYIHhoy8IXDHhJMZRXGXcYujI5O1yYFHZcQsE/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;amp;ouid=117898641365769640880"&gt;seriously, all of them&lt;/a&gt;), and none could beat its combination of excellent audio quality, a clear microphone, incredible wireless range, oodles of connectivity, and twin swappable batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIVvuz"&gt;It’s a nearly perfect gadget — but a couple of times a week, that “nearly” part makes me want to scream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAJrC3"&gt;Here’s how I described living with the Arctis Pro Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xqySSk"&gt;If I’m gaming with buddies and want a snack, I don’t need to stop chatting — I just walk several rooms away to the kitchen and the audio never cuts out. When a too-loud game drowns out my friends, I tap the dial beneath the ear cup to rebalance the audio between “game” and “chat” — it gives you two different audio devices in Windows. When the battery runs out, I can just pop a spare battery pack out of the base station and swap it in under 15 seconds. I make a lot of calls with the Arctis Pro Wireless, too, thanks to its built-in Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OJNTH9"&gt;It’s true! There’s just one tiny thing I neglected to mention: the act of keeping it powered on can involve regular embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TmQhVN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Thankfully, my webcam is too noisy to see my reddened cheeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz8IA3"&gt;Almost every week, I will inevitably be on a Zoom or Teams or Skype or Slack or Discord call when I’ll hear the dreaded beep — the beep that means the battery is nearly dead. Not “25 percent battery remaining” or “five-minute warning,” mind you. The beep means I probably have 90 seconds to apologize to my conversation partners, grab a freshly charged pack, flick the old one out, pop the new one in, and hold down the power button for what feels like an eternity while frantically gesturing to my boss / colleagues / interviewees to let them know yes I’m okay and I’m terribly sorry for wasting their time but isn’t technology &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IDuoo"&gt;(Many &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues have witnessed me doing this dance. Miraculously, I have so far escaped without it becoming a meme.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRJ0P5"&gt;If all goes well, my headset will come back to life, and I’ll pretend it never happened. But as often as not, the embarrassing heat of the moment will lead to even more embarrassment — I’ll press the power button, but the headset &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; won’t turn on because I didn’t press it quite long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DozqP9L8ONySKYgC6EEgw-iA-pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818031/verge_sean_hollister_20210831_steelseries_buttons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless’ twin power buttons on the bottom of the right ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DzxBdJ"&gt;You see, the Arctis Pro Wireless has &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; power buttons located right next to each other — one to connect to your PC or console, and one for the Bluetooth radio that lets it connect to your phone. To activate Bluetooth, you only need to briefly tap the button. Like most other Bluetooth headsets, holding it down too long throws the headset into pairing mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFWd80"&gt;But the Arctis Pro Wireless’ primary power button is just the opposite: you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to hold it to power on. And while the product manual says you only need to hold it down for two seconds, it actually takes 2.25 seconds... and a full 3.5 seconds before you get any audible confirmation that the headset responded to your command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USzWAD"&gt;That extra second feels like an eternity when you’re miming an “almost ready, be right there!” gesture in Zoom. And sometimes — between that delay and the worry that &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; I stabbed the Bluetooth button instead of the power button in my haste — I wind up letting go of the button too early and have to repeat the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqaNWb"&gt;All of this assumes the headset actually warns me that it’s powering itself off, of course! The first few months I used the headset, I never got any warning at all. Turns out, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steelseries/comments/cpbdp6/arctis_pro_wireless_doesnt_give_audible_warning/ewxip22/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;if you stop the base station from beeping every time you switch menus&lt;/a&gt;, it turns off the low battery alert as well. And once every month or two, I’ll also experience a sudden loss of power with no warning at all — typically when I’m playing a game or listening to music at low volume. My best guess is that the headset’s auto-power-off function is a poor listener and doesn’t realize I’m still playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJaFS4"&gt;Would I get rid of my Arctis Pro Wireless? Not at all. It’s a fantastic gadget I use every day for games, meetings, and calls, even if I wasn’t long past the window for return. I’ve accepted that regular embarrassment is the price I’ll pay. But it’s so tantalizingly close to being worth its $330 price in US dollars as well — which, last I checked, made it the single most expensive wireless gaming headset on the market. If SteelSeries made it slightly more comfortable / adjustable for larger heads, ironed out these power issues, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steelseries/search/?q=hinge&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;reinforced the hinge&lt;/a&gt;, a future version would be worth every penny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weTWrq"&gt;In the meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;here are the best wireless and wired gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; we’re actually recommending right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn gives up on Stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Linkedin Launches 24 Hours Stories" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSu9bQyFjNyffn2n0iKp7f_OipQ=/0x0:3959x2639/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799681/1229184225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lorenzo Di Cola/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MAlpsN"&gt;LinkedIn is shutting down its ephemeral Stories product, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-linkedin-stories-video-liz-li/"&gt;the company announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The company plans to “remove the current Stories experience by the end of September,” according to Liz Li, senior director of product. The Snapchat-style video Stories were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;first launched in February 2020 in internal testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpKQPI"&gt;Part of the reason for the shutdown is that LinkedIn learned users just didn’t want disappearing video. “In developing Stories, we assumed people wouldn’t want informal videos attached to their profile, and that ephemerality would reduce barriers that people feel about posting,” Li said. “Turns out, you want to create lasting videos that tell your professional story in a more personal way and that showcase both your personality and expertise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sWAwKB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LinkedIn’s move follows Twitter’s shutdown of Fleets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUiu6Y"&gt;LinkedIn’s move follows Twitter’s shutdown of Fleets, its Stories-like product, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. Like LinkedIn, Twitter observed that users didn’t respond to ephemeral video in the way it had wanted. “We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter,” Ilya Brown, Twitter’s vice president of product, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets"&gt;said on Twitter’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eihKcy"&gt;The two shutdowns could signal a broader pullback from ephemeral video products among social media companies. However, it seems unlikely that Snapchat or Instagram will be giving up on their Stories products anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJiX4C"&gt;Now we just have to wait and see which social media companies step back from their Clubhouse clones. If you were wondering, yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn is working on one of those&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just banned a pay equity Slack channel but lets fun dogs channel lie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWVCQwr9uJNoWOPcE2IibS19BNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799661/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esd1Pe"&gt;Apple has barred employees from creating a Slack channel to discuss pay equity. A member of the employee relations team, Apple’s version of HR, said that while the topic was “aligned with Apple’s commitment to pay equity,” it did not meet the company’s Slack Terms of Use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIofAS"&gt;“Slack channels are provided to conduct Apple business and must advance the work, deliverables, or mission of Apple departments and teams,” the employee relations representative told employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw7RUv"&gt;The company’s rules for the in-office chat app say that “Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fy9v7"&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members). On August 18th, the company approved a channel called #community-foosball. The cat and dog channels are not part of official clubs, and all of these channels were specifically created to talk about non-work activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3HsKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A clear cut act of retaliation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkWApN"&gt;Employment attorney Vincent P. White says that invoking the Slack terms may simply be an excuse to block discussions of workplace pay disparities since doing so outright would violate labor law. “Discussing pay equity is a protected activity under federal, state, and local law,” says White. “Everyone agrees on that. For them to try and impair employees’ ability to discuss pay equity and diversity in the workplace is a clear cut act of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAc4Z"&gt;Pay equity has been a hot topic among Apple employees over the past few months. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down multiple employee surveys&lt;/a&gt; aimed at gathering data on how much workers make. One survey, started by Apple engineer Cher Scarlett, has seemingly been allowed to stay up. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;early analysis of the results&lt;/a&gt; showed a 6 percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD00m"&gt;Now, organizers want to create a space for employees to discuss pay issues. While Apple previously said it did not have a pay equity problem, employees are suspicious. The company’s recent behavior, including shutting down pay surveys and now banning a pay equity Slack channel, has only exacerbated those concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P26x2q"&gt;“It sure is very convenient for Apple that these Terms of Use that they wrote are extremely useful for crushing free and open communication among employees,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBDEg"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After weeks of hate raids, Twitch streamers are taking a day off in protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4rL1tnYcBjdGWp2RPaPLTfDyaw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799557/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustraion by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;As streamers prepare to walk off Twitch, hate raids and abuse are escalating to dangerous levels&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dNf65c"&gt;On Wednesday, September 1st, a number of channels on Twitch will go dark as streamers participate in #ADayOffTwitch, a walkout designed to bring attention to the ongoing hate and harassment that’s plagued the platform for the last several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsW9zA"&gt;Created by Twitch streamers &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;RekitRaven&lt;/a&gt;, the walkout aims to bring greater awareness to the problems creators are suffering on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with these organizers, streamers, and others to talk about #ADayOffTwitch, how they’re coping with the precipitous rise of hate raids, and what they hope the platform will do to protect its users in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSuevR"&gt;A Day Off Twitch was born out of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitchdobetter&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt; movement, a hashtag created by streamers affected by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;hate raids that have exploded across Twitch&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Though the action of bombing a streamer’s chat with racist, sexist, transphobic, and generally abusive messages is not new, the phenomenon has seen a dramatic increase, thanks to users employing bots to overwhelm chats with hundreds of automatically generated messages. In response to what they thought was Twitch’s slow response to the abuse, streamer RekitRaven created the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag to urge the Amazon-owned streaming platform to deploy better tools to stem the tide of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Z4y4R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The one day off is a step in the many steps we have to take towards change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jnxi7c"&gt;Twitch has promised that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428813772391522307?s=20"&gt;fixes are forthcoming&lt;/a&gt;, but in the meantime, streamers are left to contend against the hate raids with community-developed tools and resources. ShineyPen, a Filipino, trans streamer, thought more should be done in addition to talking about the problem, so he decided to organize a walkout. “A Day Off [Twitch] is largely about coming together in solidarity. The one day off is a step in the many steps we have to take towards change,” Shiney tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Szw3lP"&gt;RekitRaven echoed Shiney’s statements that this walkout is more about solidarity among marginalized streamers than a means to impact Twitch’s bottom line. “I think it’s important to band together for the good of everyone who’s been affected and to show that we’re not gonna back down,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsmGBg"&gt;The responses to A Day Off Twitch have been varied, even among its supporters. Because of Twitch’s endemic hold on the streaming community, it’s just not feasible for some smaller streamers, arguably the population most affected by hate raids, to take a day off. For some creators, Twitch is their only means of income. Users trying to make or maintain affiliate or partner status — designations that grant creators access to many different methods of monetization — could jeopardize their finances or the health of their channel by taking even one day off. There are also contractual obligations like advertising deals or partnerships that prevent streamers from skipping a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LVxImW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADayOffTwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt; from the cast &amp;amp; crew of our streamed show. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please read &amp;amp; remember not everyone is free to take tomorrow off, no matter the level of support they have for the event. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Pu6lE8CucQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pu6lE8CucQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mother LandsRPG: Season 3! (@MotherlandsRPG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MotherlandsRPG/status/1432677596387500038?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFc6Fq"&gt;Other streamers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xdetune/status/1429841772797210628?s=20"&gt;oppose A Day Off Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for more philosophical reasons. To them, the people behind these hate raids are working to bully marginalized streamers off the platform, and taking a day off is giving them exactly what they want. Continuing to stream and speaking out against the abuse is therefore the best way to counter trolls who might not otherwise face repercussions for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1F7qR"&gt;As September 1st nears and A Day Off Twitch gains traction, there’s a noticeable silence from some of Twitch’s biggest stars. And some of the larger streamers who are talking about it don’t have nice things to say. Asmongold, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20861066/world-of-warcraft-wow-classic-twitch-fortnite-ninja-streamers-change"&gt;a longtime &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft &lt;/em&gt;streamer&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/wow-disappointment-plus-twitch-start-mass-exodus-into-1847283978"&gt;made headlines when he switched to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ShinyStrongSkunkGOWSkull-5Md7teUvy22IRBHt"&gt;said in a stream&lt;/a&gt;, “Nobody gives a fuck if you take the day off. Nobody knows who you are.” He goes on to say he would participate in a Twitch walkout if every other big streamer got involved and that he believes “in the power of numbers.” Asmongold has 2.4 million followers on Twitch and did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jULNEz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not worried about that. We’re already making an impact. The world is watching.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tatpu4"&gt;There’s a wider feeling of abandonment and hypocrisy concerning larger streamers’ silence on the matter of hate raids. During pride month or protests for racial equality, streamers large and small voiced their support for the communities affected. Yet some of those same voices aren’t being heard now. “I accept that not everyone will be on board with supporting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADayOffTwitch?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt;,” ShineyPen says. “I believe that many, not all, of these bigger creators are speaking from a privileged perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fh3s7l"&gt;“Being vocal has the potential to hurt them financially,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vicious696"&gt;Parris Lilly&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch streamer and host for Xbox’s 2021 Gamescom presentation, adds. “Nobody cares how POCs are treated as long as it doesn’t affect them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzMTQU"&gt;RekitRaven was less concerned about larger streamers’ seeming unwillingness to participate in or even acknowledge the Twitch walkout. “All I can say is I’m not worried about that. We’re already making an impact. The world is watching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntLeeu"&gt;Twitch is also watching. A spokesperson for Twitch told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We support our streamers’ rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service. No one should have to experience malicious and hateful attacks based on who they are or what they stand for, and we are working hard on improved channel-level ban evasion detection and additional account improvements to help &lt;a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Combating-Targeted-Attacks?language=en_US"&gt;make Twitch a safer place for creators&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BeQVg"&gt;Twitch’s support for A Day Off Twitch extends even beyond its statements. The platform is kicking off its &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/08/26/this-subtember-is-going-to-be-magic/"&gt;Subtember event&lt;/a&gt; on September 2nd, a day after the protests, presumably so streamers who may participate can still take advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iON6Ts"&gt;As Twitch works on developing those safety improvements and streamers still contend with the dangerous hate raids that are leading to doxxing and swatting, the conversation of moving to other platforms has yet again cropped up. Twitch is the biggest fish in the streaming pond, but it is not the only one. Even after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down its Mixer platform&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook and YouTube offer alternatives to streamers fed up with what they feel is Twitch’s slow and reactive response to harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="89o51a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Creators on Facebook Gaming can disable raids altogether, or select individual creator pages to ‘block’ incoming raids from.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZzPOd"&gt;DrLupo, once one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he signed an exclusive deal with YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, making the platform an attractive alternative to Twitch and, most importantly, one that can be financially viable. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;asked YouTube Gaming what protections it had in place for streamers, but it did not respond in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqC4hx"&gt;While it does not have the reach of Twitch or YouTube, Facebook Gaming is also slowly growing its streaming presence especially among Black creators — a frequent target of hate raids. Facebook Gaming’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22158677/facebook-gaming-black-gaming-creator-program"&gt;Black Creators Program&lt;/a&gt; guarantees monthly pay, early product access, and offers mentorship programs to participating Black streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UljqEE"&gt;Luis Olivalves, Facebook Gaming’s global gaming creator partnerships director, also shared the platform’s policies for streamer protections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SzH0Al"&gt;The majority of creators come to Facebook Gaming to build positive and supportive communities around the games they love. To do this, it’s important for creators and their moderators to have tools and resources at their disposal to foster the safe and inclusive environments they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvo58M"&gt;We also hear from our creators and gaming communities that the use of real names on our platform, which reduces anonymity, contributes to a generally more positive environment on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQQB7B"&gt;While we find that raids are most commonly used in a positive and supportive way on our platform, it’s important our creators have control over who can and can’t raid their channels. Creators on Facebook Gaming can disable raids altogether, or select individual creator pages to ‘block’ incoming raids from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bkCrS1"&gt;Disabling raids and the ability to screen raids before they could cause harm is one of the biggest asks from the Twitch community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajXJR1"&gt;And if moving off Twitch simply isn’t a feasible solution, there are now ways to continue to use the platform while depriving Twitch of its cut of streamers’ profits. Streamlabs, a popular streaming tools service, recently announced it’s &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers"&gt;adding a tipping function&lt;/a&gt; that allows viewers to set up recurring donations. Currently, only streamers who meet certain criteria are allowed to collect subscription money of which Twitch takes 50 percent. This Streamlabs option makes it possible for anyone to receive recurring donations, 100 percent of which goes directly to the streamer after processing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNjDV"&gt;The organizers of A Day Off Twitch don’t necessarily want to jump ship yet. “I don’t have plans to find a new platform,” ShineyPen says. “However [...] I do believe that having an alternative is good to have in our back pockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haYwAy"&gt;The connection to Twitch is strong. It’s the place where these streamers have built friendships, communities, and business opportunities, and they don’t want to lose that place because of the maliciousness of racist, transphobic trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUSWVe"&gt;“There are so many marginalized individuals out there who are seeking a  place to feel safe, to feel like they belong and to have representation and that’s what we’re doing,” ShineyPen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BySDE7"&gt;“We owe it to ourselves and our communities to at least try to improve conditions and make it a better place,” said Lucia Everblack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3i4LfT"&gt;According to Everblack, A Day Off Twitch is already successful, even before it’s begun. “The whole goal was to generate broader discussion.” But more than awareness, Everblack and the walkout’s organizers and participants just want their communities to feel safe and be protected. “We don’t just want solutions to current problems,” Everblack says. “We want policies in place so that these kinds of problems never happen again or at least never get this severe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uuuvbs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article originally misidentified streamer ShineyPen’s race. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzjovu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes its mandatory return to office date into 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GG9hTcCzmL9tD7ptIhSJicnA0lA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799313/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvxQEG"&gt;In an email to employees today, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/extending-our-voluntary-return-office/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai said&lt;/a&gt; that even though “we are welcoming back tens of thousands of Googlers on a voluntary basis,” the company will extend its voluntary return to work policy until at least January 10th, 2022. After that date, the current plan is to have countries and locations make mandatory return to work decisions depending on local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLSEsF"&gt;The most recent plan shared publicly would’ve pushed Google employees back to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;at some point in September&lt;/a&gt;, but that won’t happen. Whenever its offices expect to have employees there in-person, Pichai reiterated that there would be a 30-day heads up first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDyPiR"&gt;The letter didn’t directly cite the Delta variant, but waves of infection have again wrangled plans of several Big Tech companies as they consider when and how to have employees in offices again. In May, Pichai outlined&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt; a new hybrid schedule of three in-office days per week&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be several months before that is in play for many of Google’s employees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7rr4A"&gt;The next Apple Watch is experiencing manufacturing issues that could lead to the product being released later than expected, according to separate reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Watch-production-delayed-as-engineers-wrestle-with-quality-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The potential delay is reportedly due to complexities in the smartwatch’s new design, which is rumored to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;flat sides and bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te1ypv"&gt;Sources told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; that small-scale production for the next Apple Watch had begun but that it encountered “critical challenges in reaching satisfactory production performance.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported similar details. Production has now been “temporarily halted” while Apple and its suppliers work to solve the manufacturing issues ahead of eventual mass production, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AiXY9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The next Apple Watch is expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Se0EIi"&gt;The new Apple Watch, expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will see screen size increases to 41mm and 45mm (a 1mm bump from the currently available options), a faster processor, and “a flatter display and edges,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;in his Power On newsletter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. While Gurman reported that the Series 7 won’t bring any big health upgrades “until at least next year,” &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that the new Watch will add new features “such as blood pressure measurement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh9V18"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;at an event last September&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is expected to host another September product event this year. Given these reported production challenges with the next Apple Watch, if Apple does host a September event, there’s a possibility the Apple Watch might not make an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZL4Ty"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung adds new foldable features to its older Z Fold and Z Flip phones with One UI 3.1.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buD9WNxv5g64Fx49Rs1fERJ5Kw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798834/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osL0Cu"&gt;Samsung’s new Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 phones add a bunch of clever new features designed for foldable phones as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users"&gt;One UI 3.1.1 update&lt;/a&gt;, but if you already own a Fold 2, Z Flip, or even the original Galaxy Fold, you’ll still be able to get some of the new additions without shelling out for a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUS8kAXRx8uLumDtDMpWnUamNkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817418/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_12.32.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLFk6Z"&gt;Available on all five foldable models is the new Drag and Split feature, which — as the name implies — allows you to tap and drag on a link to open it side by side with the original webpage or message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWWtZP"&gt;Samsung’s larger Fold models will also be getting the adjustable app windows for its multitasking mode, allowing you to adjust the height and width of the individual apps when you have multiple apps open at once. The older models will also get the automatically rotating app function, custom aspect ratios, and a newly added split view for messaging apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hlnuZ_QEOjBJus5XCBqAGI6Zts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817410/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyEcbMre1ZTAoCPORr58VsZ6uDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817412/04_Set_Aspect_Ratio_for_Apps.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Emj4"&gt;Lastly, for both the Z Fold 2 and the earlier Z Flips, Samsung is adding the option to force apps to use its “Flex mode” that puts video content on one half of a folded display, with playback controls on the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E41n3o"&gt;Samsung has worked to help keep its older foldables relevant even while rolling out new software features on its newer devices before. It offered a similar update for the original Fold last year when it released the Galaxy Z Fold 2 that added several new features it had introduced with the second-generation foldable. It’s a testament to how new the foldable field is in general. Samsung is still figuring out the best ways to use these new form factors, but it’s also not leaving behind early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmwIP"&gt;The One UI 3.1.1 update should be rolling out to Fold 2 and Z Flip owners starting today, while the original Galaxy Fold is expected to get the update “around a week later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGwFMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is expanding its plans to put less politics in the News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2XUumTAa5OZizQq9E4htPf1a0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798755/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rHXftK"&gt;Facebook is expanding an experiment in reducing political content in the News Feed. In an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/"&gt;update to a February blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s seen “positive results” in reducing this content for some users in a handful of countries. Now, it’s expanding a test of the strategy to Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain, and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FFSLY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported on&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s plans before the announcement. As it notes, Facebook’s new test also involves changing the signals it favors when promoting content. “Some engagement signals can better indicate what posts people find more valuable than others,” product management director Aastha Gupta writes. “Based on that feedback, we’re gradually expanding some tests to put less emphasis on signals such as how likely someone is to comment on or share political content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwMXqo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tests will put less emphasis on the value of commenting and sharing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJaF0p"&gt;Conversely, Facebook will more heavily weigh signals like “how likely people are to provide us with negative feedback on posts about political topics and current events.” The company acknowledges that this could affect “public affairs content” and decrease traffic to news publishers, and it’s planning a “gradual and methodical rollout” of these tests over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX4w8e"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276076/facebook-political-posts-reduce-news-feed-tests"&gt;started its politics-reduction tests&lt;/a&gt; in February for some users in Canada, Brazil, the US, and Indonesia. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397583/facebook-news-feed-customer-survey-inspirational-relevant-interests-posts"&gt;It later announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would emphasize “inspiring and uplifting” posts and provide more avenues for people to explicitly indicate what they don’t like — rather than having Facebook infer it from their usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVZ6qf"&gt;These changes come amid a heated debate over what kinds of interactions matter most on Facebook. Commenting and sharing are some of the rare engagement signals that outsiders can measure, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;they’ve overwhelmingly indicated&lt;/a&gt; that political (and largely right-wing) content dominates people’s interactions on the platform. But Facebook has rejected this framing, saying political content is tangential to most people’s experience — and only &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/what-do-people-actually-see-on-facebook-in-the-us/"&gt;makes up 6 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the typical news feed. Now, it’s apparently trying to integrate that philosophy more directly into the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
