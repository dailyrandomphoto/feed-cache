    <title>TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are struggling with ivermectin misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E4ieLf"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are dealing with waves of content about ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug that has picked up traction among anti-vaxxers as a COVID-19 treatment. Sales of ivermectin meant for animals, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/ivermectin-covid-19-warning-injuries/index.html"&gt;calls to poison control centers&lt;/a&gt;, have increased enough that the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;issued a consumer update&lt;/a&gt; explaining why people shouldn’t take it to treat or prevent COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMCeoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ML7E7P"&gt;On TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tiktok-covid-cures-ivermectin-horse-deworming-medication-1216268/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found videos, some of which had more than a million views, promoting ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment under tags like #ivermectin4covid and #ivermectinworks. TikTok has since removed the videos for violating community guidelines and blocked the tags, and a spokesperson says TikTok will continue removing related videos and hashtags. The #ivermectin tag is still up, though many of the most popular videos in the tag are of healthcare professionals debunking misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWxMYR"&gt;On Reddit this week, moderators of several hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx3gw/reddit-responds-to-calls-from-moderators-to-fight-disinformation"&gt;called on the platform&lt;/a&gt; to take action against COVID-19 misinformation, including banning subreddits that spread medical disinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoILsj"&gt;Disagreeing with the requests for outright bans, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;shared a response&lt;/a&gt; in r/announcements, saying “Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus.” The post goes on to say that Reddit will take action when people promote fraud or encourage harm, as well as quarantine certain subreddits so that they don’t appear in searches and can’t be accessed without logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yInsW6"&gt;Moderators &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pcb67h/response_to_yesterdays_admin_post/"&gt;criticized Huffman’s post&lt;/a&gt;, saying subreddits that promote the use of ivermectin encourage harm but have been allowed to stay. According to a spokesperson, Reddit is currently reviewing r/ivermectin and related communities on the site. Reddit recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqmg/reddit-quarantine-nonewnormal"&gt;quarantined r/NoNewNormal&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-mask, anti-vax subreddit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Q9pXG"&gt;People in Facebook groups have also been sharing misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ewzn/facebook-is-allowing-ivermectin-ads-at-a-time-when-it-really-shouldnt"&gt;making sponsored posts&lt;/a&gt; that promote and advertise ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19. Facebook has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of COVID-19 misinformation that circulates on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAF2LO"&gt;According to a spokesperson, Facebook removes content “that attempts to buy, sell, donate or ask for Ivermectin.” They added, “We also enforce against any account or group that violates our COVID-19 and vaccine policies, including claims that Ivermectin is a guaranteed cure or guaranteed prevention, and we don’t allow ads promoting Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.” Still, public and private anti-vax groups try to dodge moderation by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;using euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “ivm” or “moo juice” for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKriKU"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, and other social sites have struggled throughout the pandemic to reckon with the rapid spread of medical misinformation. Platforms have updated their policies, added links to authorities like the CDC, and removed millions of posts. But as the pandemic continues and misinformation evolves, real solutions — social distancing, masking, and vaccines — remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gM83jsdLEc9-4xWqD81_x8Smv3c=/0x94:2100x1494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785174/Windows_11_PC_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQhjbJ"&gt;In June, we wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;that Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly because their processors aren’t as new and fully featured as Microsoft would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKX5Su"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22408235"&gt;Microsoft revealed a change of plan to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it won’t technically abandon those millions of PCs, because you’ll be able to manually install the downloadable Windows 11 ISO on whatever you want. The company’s also extending its official CPU compatibility list to a bunch of Intel’s most expensive Xeon workstation processors and its most expensive line of Core X desktop CPUs — and, tellingly, the less powerful Intel chip it shipped in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102490/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Surface Studio 2&lt;/a&gt;, so it no longer has to defend the idea of abandoning a flagship product &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Studio-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that it still continues to sell brand-new&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4yjY3"&gt;But while it might seem like Microsoft’s opening up the floodgates, the confusing reality of Windows 11 upgrades hasn’t changed&lt;em&gt; quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as you might think. While DIY PC gamers, IT admins, and other power users will be able to perform a clean install of Windows 11 on existing hardware dating back years, it still sounds like Microsoft will be encouraging millions of people to replace their perfectly good Windows PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxQa4u"&gt;Imagine for a moment that you’ve never heard of an ISO; you’re hoping to upgrade your aging machine to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;the refreshing yet familiar Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; this fall; and you want to know if it’ll work. You might well fire up Microsoft’s PC Health Check app, because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550951/microsoft-pc-health-checkup-app-update-windows-11-compatibility-tool-details"&gt;that’s the exact tool&lt;/a&gt; the company is advertising for that purpose. But that tool might lead you astray. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that app will still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;check your CPU against Microsoft’s list of supported processors — and direct you to “relevant support articles that include potential remediation steps” if you don’t have the chips that Microsoft prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MjsgFY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10721063"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjcUZB"&gt;Most Windows PC owners probably won’t bother with a compatibility checker app, of course. They’ll just wait for the Windows Update that can automatically bring it to them for free, much like how Windows 10 was a free update when it arrived in 2015. But here, again, Microsoft will only be updating computers with supported CPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUgCBn"&gt;Avoiding automatic updates for CPUs that aren’t supported makes some amount of sense: Microsoft doesn’t want to be blamed if it makes your Windows experience worse, and it can’t test every single configuration under the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1dREi"&gt;But how much worse is worse? Microsoft makes it sound pretty bad at first, writing that it saw 52 percent more kernel mode crashes (aka the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;BSOD&lt;/a&gt;) when testing systems that didn’t meant its minimum spec — whereas machines that did meet it had a 99.8 percent crash-free experience. But if you do the math, it means we’re going from a 2-in-1,000 chance of a BSOD to a 3-in-1,000 chance. That additional amount of downtime might not be acceptable for a sysadmin managing thousands of older computers, but it’d likely be a different story for the average person who only buys a new PC every four to six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jy9S0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;As we’ve explained before&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has some valid security reasons to insist on more stringent hardware requirements like TPM 2.0, particularly from its laptop and desktop partners. The company’s been targeted by some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551193/microsoft-customer-support-tools-solarwinds-hackers-nobelium"&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;troubling&lt;/a&gt; attacks and would like to prevent more, but it only has so much leverage over the PC industry to make sure security features are actually turned on. (Microsoft has technically mandated TPM 2.0 &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm"&gt;since July 2016&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Xlmx"&gt;None of this will be a problem for those who simply buy a new computer with a preloaded copy of Windows 11. But that’s my point — now that Microsoft has revealed it’s not actually locking Windows 11 to those security features, the list of supported CPUs feels even more like a gift to Intel and PC manufacturers in the form of extra computer sales (where Microsoft profits off each Windows 10 license) than a staunch security play. And it’ll be a shame, particularly for the environment, if people wind up tossing PCs that are perfectly capable of running the new OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0RzNv"&gt;As security expert (and former Microsoft threat intelligence analyst) Kevin Beaumont &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617"&gt;put it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s motivations are questionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VbB3Gv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, MS are trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYpJv4"&gt;Microsoft is potentially about to push lots of people toward buying a new computer this fall, and PC manufacturers will be only too happy to help. I just wonder how shameless Microsoft will be as time goes on: when it comes to promoting its own Microsoft Edge browser, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/17/21520315/microsoft-install-office-pwa-web-app-without-permission-update-word-powerpoint-excel"&gt;disrespected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;its own users’ choices&lt;/a&gt; with forced Windows Updates. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says it’s subject to DOJ, DHS, and SEC investigations into Tread Plus injuries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFxr1ecdGgPAwBxtbuwiACgEnV8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785053/akrales_190328_3240_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXn0J1"&gt;Peloton has said that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have subpoenaed it for documents and information related to its reporting on injuries caused by its Tread Plus treadmill (&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/peloton-acknowledges-subpoenas-sec-investigation-79677239"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ABC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company released this information &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/d84f3085-8c04-45d0-b6ab-0550de50c7ad"&gt;in its annual 10-K form&lt;/a&gt;, citing the investigations by the agencies, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as risks to be disclosed to its investors. You can read excerpts of the document below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oFnqhF"&gt;[A]s previously disclosed, we have received reports of a number of injuries associated with our Tread+ product, one of which led to the death of a child. In April 2021, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) issued a warning to consumers about the safety hazards associated with the Tread+ and is continuing to investigate the matter. We are also subject to investigations by DOJ, DHS, and the SEC related to this matter. We intend to cooperate fully with each of these investigations, and at this time, we are unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kpKAcv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2r72LJ"&gt;In addition, the DOJ and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have subpoenaed us for documents and other information related to our reporting of the injuries associated with our products and the SEC is also investigating our public disclosures concerning these matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3BaPZA"&gt;Peloton initially pushed back against the CPSC’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389301/cpsc-treadmill-peloton-children-risk-injury"&gt;April warning about the Tread Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which said that the product shouldn’t be used in homes with small children or pets. The company called the CPSC’s warning “inaccurate and misleading,” and &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;said that the product was safe to use&lt;/a&gt; as long as all safety instructions were followed. It also said that customers had already been warned in March when Peloton’s &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/tread-plus-initial-statement"&gt;CEO sent a note out&lt;/a&gt; following the death of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXgL0N"&gt;The company also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;fought efforts to recall the treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;issuing one in May&lt;/a&gt;. In the recall announcement, Peloton’s CEO called its initial response to the CPSC a “mistake.” It’s unclear whether the subpoenas from the DOJ and DHS played any part in Peloton’s decision to issue a recall or when they were received by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSudKZ"&gt;Peloton is still working on getting its Tread Plus back on the market after it recalled the device, but the subpoenas likely mean that even that milestone won’t be the end of the saga for Peloton. It also means that Peloton could face further legal ramifications on top of the monetary ones. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;the money issues caused by the recall&lt;/a&gt; are already significant — the company cited Tread Plus’ issues &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4836b73e-6e63-4517-a3cd-86c45ea98e68"&gt;in its earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, saying that recall expenses cost it $100 million in its 2021 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCpCYc"&gt;Peloton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was unable to comment on active litigation. The DHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about its involvement in the matter. In &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-08-27/peloton-ceo-on-earnings-subpoena-new-products-video?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton’s CEO said it would cooperate with any investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID surge causes liquid oxygen problems for SpaceX, water utilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-PANDEMIC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wdp5EoJz8i5E4z859C5ujTBzO6Q=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784993/1209519904.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHUOP9"&gt;Demand for oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients is spiking during the latest pandemic surge, leaving liquid oxygen in short supply for other uses, including water purification and rocket launches. As supplies get redirected to hospitals, other industries are scrambling to figure out alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikOj9h"&gt;“We’re actually going to be impacted this year with the lack of liquid oxygen for launch,” Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/liquid-oxygen-shortage-squeezes-spacex-launch-plans/"&gt;said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. “We certainly are going to make sure the hospitals are going to have the oxygen that they need, but for anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6IPCtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2XxU"&gt;While oxygen is extremely common in the atmosphere, hospitals need high concentrations of it to treat patients with damaged respiratory systems, like people with severe cases of COVID. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/who-sounds-alarm-over-covid-linked-oxygen-crisis"&gt;Here in the US&lt;/a&gt;, getting highly concentrated oxygen from place to place is usually achieved by chilling the gas into a liquid, which is less bulky but can cause its own problems. Earlier this year, there were shortages in Los Angeles hospitals when equipment &lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/article/in-los-angeles-and-beyond-oxygen-is-the-latest-covid-bottleneck/"&gt;used to turn the liquid back into a gas kept freezing over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkkwgA"&gt;Now, hospitals are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the increasing demand is causing problems outside the medical industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzOeuD"&gt;Rocket companies like SpaceX often use liquid oxygen as a propellant. During a launch, it &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/Rocketology/tag/liquid-oxygen/"&gt;reacts with fuel&lt;/a&gt; (think: rocket-grade kerosene), sending a spacecraft soaring. If the shortage continues, it could possibly delay launches — but that hasn’t happened yet. “This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor,” SpaceX founder Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430778850825355269?s=21"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk6esy"&gt;The shortage is also putting indirect pressure on other parts of the space industry. A gas supplier for the United Launch Alliance is now focused on addressing the dire oxygen situation in Florida, a move that could change plans for a satellite launch next month, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/liquid-oxygen-shortage-squeezes-spacex-launch-plans/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceNews &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RfaCd7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the water utility started using bleach instead of oxygen to treat its water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zCXyL3"&gt;Meanwhile, in Florida, some residents have been seeing — and in some cases, smelling — evidence of the liquid oxygen shortfall in their water supplies. Water utilities use liquid oxygen to create ozone. When ozone is &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/water/bsdw/operatorcertification/TrainingModules/dw-27_ozone_wb.pdf"&gt;used to treat water&lt;/a&gt;, it can destroy harmful bacteria and viruses, and break down compounds that can make water taste or smell funky. Chlorine and other chemicals can serve the same function, but oxygen has fewer byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3etXD7"&gt;In Orlando, shortages have led the local utility to ask residents to stop watering their lawns and conserve water in an effort to extend the supply of liquid oxygen. Unfortunately, the utility has only seen a “moderate reduction” in water demand, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.ouc.com/water-info"&gt;update posted&lt;/a&gt; on August 25th. Residents reduced usage from 90 million gallons per day to 82 million gallons per day, but the utility’s goal is to only pump 50 million gallons per day “until LOX supplies return to normal in Central Florida.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKiWsl"&gt;Over in Tampa Bay, the water utility started using bleach instead of oxygen to treat its water. The utility usually uses oxygen to remove hydrogen sulfide, a gas that smells like rotten eggs, from its water. In switching to bleach, the utility &lt;a href="https://www.tampabaywater.org/Newsroom/News-Releases/ArticleID/549/Tampa-Bay-Water-Making-Temporary-Change-to-Water-Treatment-in-South-Hillsborough-County-Residents-Should-See-No-Change-in-Drinking-Water-Quality"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that “consumers who are sensitive to taste and odor changes in drinking water might notice a slight change during this period” even though the quality and safety will remain unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsZcqN"&gt;Florida has the highest COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the country, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. In Tampa in particular, an emergency room was so crowded with COVID patients that there was a 12-hour wait. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox engineer fixes user’s profile picture, makes the world a better place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WEiBGM3KcJkH9pgpkghycNfPUq8=/0x0:1026x684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784780/Screenshot_2021_08_27_131017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6EnLr"&gt;At times, Twitter can be a bad place, amplifying some of the worst opinions and people on the internet. But on some days, the platform can remind us there are still decent humans doing good work to make the world a better, less shitty place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX6Mjp"&gt;Long ago, an Xbox user who goes by Noukon on Twitter purchased a Pac-Man ghost avatar for a dollar. Over the years, as the Xbox user interface underwent changes and iterations, Noukon’s avatar got smaller and smaller until it was little more than a tiny blue square lost in the endless gray sea of the Xbox avatar display. Dismayed yet defiant, Noukon shared his problem on Twitter but expressed resolve to keep the cherished avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCs2tA"&gt;“I bought this gamerpic for 80 Xbox Points in 2006,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noukon/status/1428469278068539394"&gt;Noukon tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “And I’ll be fucked if it won’t remain the best dollar I’ve ever spent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84cC7i"&gt;As luck would have it, Eden Marie, an Xbox engineer, saw Noukon’s lament and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430331838933860354?s=20"&gt;pledged to help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XWZEf"&gt;“Listen, I can’t promise anything, but I’m going to make it my personal mission to fix this,” Eden responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxJvyH"&gt;To start, Eden purchased the Pac-Man avatar, now $2.38 instead of a dollar, which, interestingly, is a dollar over the standard inflation rate. (Hey, Xbox gotta get its cut, too, right?) After that, Eden chronicled her process of trying to restore this ancient relic of a gamer avatar from 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QC7XKT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Listen, I can’t promise anything, but I’m going to make it my personal mission to fix this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJy14e"&gt;Eden first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430771417298083848"&gt;fixed an inconsistency&lt;/a&gt; between how an avatar looks when you’re viewing your own profile versus what it looks like viewing someone else’s. On your own profile, Xbox 360 gamerpics look like huge gray circles with the teeny little avatar in the center. On others’ profiles, that same avatar looks much better. It’s still very small, but its background becomes a blown-up version of the small avatar, which creates a cleaner look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNF1fL"&gt;After fixing that problem, Eden’s next task was to figure out how to make the avatar look better on the Xbox profile sign-in screen. Apparently, there are a lot of ways Xbox displays your avatar, making Eden’s project a little cumbersome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvLjMk"&gt;“If I were to ask you how many ways we display gamerpics on the console and your answer wasn’t something like ‘all of them,’ then you’d be off the mark,” she tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH0vq7"&gt;After some trial and error, Eden seemed to hit upon a solution. She took advantage of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1431075701566828546"&gt;Xbox UI’s affinity for transparent images&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylJY1P"&gt;“Did you know that if you upload a PNG with transparency as a custom gamerpic, the Dashboard and Guide will respect that transparency in most places?” Eden wrote. “Some of the built in gamerpics have transparency built in. Maybe we can take advantage of that here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vvk9C"&gt;To get around Xbox cutting off the edges of a square gamerpic, Eden decided to place the square pic inside of a circle and make the circle transparent. It worked, and it looks great now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JNYJjO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's a lot of fun, and sometimes, you even learn something new, like... apparently 360 gamerpics supported transparency all along?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SURPRISE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, what do you think, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noukon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@noukon&lt;/a&gt;? Feel better about that dollar? &lt;a href="https://t.co/zxQx7SmHJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zxQx7SmHJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eden Marie (@neonepiphany) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1431085190034571264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A0wjbo"&gt;Eden credited her ability to update Noukon’s avatar to Xbox’s policy of allowing its engineers free time to tinker with whatever they like within the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyv2qV"&gt;“I love that we do it, and this week I absolutely chose to use it to rescue ghosts,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3AmXV"&gt;A noble cause indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DE6OBP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5mun0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: 10 years of Tim Cook, iPhone 13 rumors, and the OnlyFans decision</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KG5sA9"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lk0IkF"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2462775031&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GnLRj"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay, Dieter, and managing editor Alex Cranz talk with senior reporter Adi Robertson about why OnlyFans planned to prohibit sexually explicit content on its platform and then quickly reversed its decision days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OauTMW"&gt;In the second half of the show, the crew pivots to discuss Tim Cook’s first 10 years as Apple CEO and the rumors about some Apple products coming this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z29cLN"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in this episode — like a new gadget to remix Kanye West songs and Elon Musk’s humanoid Tesla robots — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors taps Hertz board member to right the ship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck Reveal Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBz6eqzykCAKFPZwH42RUDuoxyM=/0x109:5623x3858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784569/1222922472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EY6Uby"&gt;Lordstown Motors has hired a new CEO, Daniel Ninivaggi, just two months after its previous chief executive and founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;resigned after misleading investors&lt;/a&gt;. Ninivaggi comes from an automotive background and recently wrapped up a seven-year stint as a member of Hertz’s board of directors, where he helped oversee the rental car company’s very public bankruptcy and restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz5C6u"&gt;That experience could come in handy. Lordstown Motors needs someone at the helm who can steer the company through the adversity that lies ahead — including, mainly, surviving past early 2022, which is when the startup says it expects to deliver its first electric pickup trucks &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;when it will also run out of money unless it finds new funding. But Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;struggles since its late 2020 SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; have also played out under an intense spotlight, something that Ninivaggi appears to have gained some experience with at Hertz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3dBXE"&gt;Hertz was in crisis mode during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in large part &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-26/goldman-was-just-trying-to-help?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;because it had borrowed heavily against its fleet of cars&lt;/a&gt;. As the markets dipped, the company’s lenders got jittery and started thinking about seizing those cars in order to recoup what they were owed. In response, Hertz filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sh3elE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NWnhv6"&gt;That’s when the real weirdness started. Hertz became a darling of the booming population of retail traders, including those who had been introduced to the stock market by apps like Robinhood as well as those who spend their time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;obsessing over information shared in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. People were buying Hertz stock left and right, post-bankruptcy, despite there being &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883047437/owner-of-a-broken-hertz"&gt;almost no chance that the shares they were trading would be worth anything&lt;/a&gt; when the company was eventually restructured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fL8yba"&gt;In other words, Hertz was a meme stock before that term became part of our shared lexicon. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-12/if-you-want-hertz-have-some-hertz?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;tried to take advantage of this&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to sell even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;shares directly to those eager retail traders, though a judge quickly cut them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57KcxM"&gt;As all this was happening, Hertz’s largest shareholder cut bait and backed out: billionaire Carl Icahn sold his company’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hertz-glo-hldg-bankruptcy-icahn/billionaire-icahn-exits-hertz-with-significant-loss-after-bankruptcy-filing-idUSKBN23339J"&gt;stake in Hertz in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;. But Ninivaggi — one of Icahn’s former executives — remained on Hertz’s board. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy this year and, to the surprise of many, regular &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-12/money-stuff-the-hertz-gamblers-were-right?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;retail shareholders actually got something in return after all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZLy14"&gt;Ninivaggi has other automotive experience beyond Hertz, mostly at companies that are deep in the supply chain. Whether or not Lordstown Motors was more attracted to that, or to Ninivaggi’s experience with Hertz’s rollercoaster year, the cash-strapped startup is paying handsomely to have him run the show. He’ll make an annual salary of $750,000 and is eligible for a yearly bonus of nearly $1 million, according to a filing with the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921109520/tm2125956d3_8k.htm"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), and was given a company stock package currently worth around $4.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn8Tt2"&gt;In return, he’ll have to help the startup get its electric pickup truck into production, raise more money (including following up on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;plan to rent out space at its factory&lt;/a&gt;), and then compete in an increasingly crowded field of electric pickup trucks. All this while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;facing down investigations from the Department of Justice and SEC&lt;/a&gt; that were kicked off by his predecessor’s misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft won’t stop you installing Windows 11 on older PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bV8dQOMT2f2VzKcCny934l5HVLQ=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784505/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xgxM4"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that it won’t block people from installing Windows 11 on most older PCs. While the software maker has recommended hardware requirements for Windows 11 — which it’s largely sticking to — a restriction to install the OS will only be enforced when you try to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 through Windows Update. This means anyone with a PC with an older CPU that doesn’t officially pass the upgrade test can still go ahead and download an ISO file of Windows 11 and install the OS manually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLvzcH"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; in June, and made it clear that only Intel 8th Gen and beyond CPUs were officially supported. Microsoft now tells us that this install workaround is designed primarily for businesses to evaluate Windows 11, and that people can upgrade at their own risk as the company can’t guarantee driver compatibility and overall system reliability. Microsoft won’t be recommending or advertising this method of installing Windows 11 to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfKHEK"&gt;It’s a big change that means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;millions of PCs&lt;/a&gt; won’t be left behind, technically. Consumers will still need to go to the effort of downloading an ISO file and manually installing Windows 11, which the vast majority probably won’t do. But for those happy to install Windows manually, the actual minimum Windows 11 specs mean that CPU generations don’t matter, as long as you have a 64-bit 1GHz processor with two or more cores, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI6k5xCoGk3Cjzg7J2LDyTDIdXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671569/windows11main.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 will now run on older CPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GqoXja"&gt;Alongside the workaround to install Windows 11, Microsoft is also tweaking its minimum system requirements to include more processors. Intel’s Core X-series and Xeon W-series will now be officially supported for Windows 11 upgrades, alongside Intel’s Core 7820HQ chip that’s inside the Surface Studio 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCPFCw"&gt;Microsoft has been testing these processors with Intel, but the 7820HQ is only supported on devices that ship with &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/dch-principles-best-practices#dch-design-principles"&gt;Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps (DCH)&lt;/a&gt;. You may have heard of DCH in GPU drivers, and it’s a cleaner and more secure driver design that Microsoft has been encouraging OEMs and hardware manufacturers to adopt in recent years. Apps like GPU control panels are separated from the driver install with DCH, allowing OEMs to service them separately without having to issue new driver updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgFQ3z"&gt;Microsoft won’t be officially supporting any Zen 1 CPUs, despite testing them recently. “After carefully analyzing the first generation of AMD Zen processors in partnership with AMD, together we concluded that there are no additions to the supported CPU list,” says Microsoft’s Windows team in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZJ0VO"&gt;Obviously there is a workaround to install Windows 11 on these older AMD systems, but Microsoft says devices that don’t meet the minimum hardware requirements “had 52 percent more kernel mode crashes.” Devices that meet the official minimum specs “had a 99.8 percent crash free experience,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZMHj4Lyvc46QwrVeL848d1DHiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809045/windows11pchealthchecker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated PC Health Check app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux2KXb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to update its PC Health Check app (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindowsinsiderpreviewpchealth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a preview is available here&lt;/a&gt;) to include the new Intel CPUs and provide much greater clarity on why your PC might not be able to officially upgrade. The new PC checker app will let Windows users know if they need to simply enable Secure Boot or TPM 2.0 to upgrade, which is much better than the vague unsupported message that greeted many in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8rwBY"&gt;Microsoft also details how it arrived at these minimum system requirements for Windows 11. Microsoft wants to push Windows toward modern DCH drivers and modern security with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support and virtualization-based security (VBS). There’s never a good time to try to change hardware requirements, but with a workaround in place it does cushion the blow of what Microsoft is trying to achieve around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;improving the security, compatibility, and reliability aspects of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a tiny tube amp in this super pricey Astell &amp; Kern music player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cccVmGKqjPuRUCIjbQJXc-skt0o=/0x0:2234x1489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784480/akultimahero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qj4Sdc"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. &lt;a href="http://aknewsroom.armourhome.co.uk/2021/08/27/astellkerns-latest-aultima-sp2000t-portable-digital-audio-player-packs-a-next-gen-triple-amp-system/"&gt;The $2,399 A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; releases in October, and it stands out from the brand’s previous models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15752152/astell-kern-kann-review-audiophile-pmp"&gt;Kann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18518150/astell-kern-kann-cube-audiophile-pmp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Kann Cube&lt;/a&gt; with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you’re content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there’s some real engineering swagger in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQaKO"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern managed to fit a tiny tube amp inside of this device. Specifically, it uses &lt;a href="https://korgnutube.com/en/"&gt;a Korg Nutube 6P1&lt;/a&gt;, which conceptually operates just like larger tube amps, only it’s small enough to fit in a device that can go in your pocket. To avoid any interference that the resonance of the tubes might generate, Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it developed a modular structure on the PCB just for the tubes, fixing them with silicone to minimize vibrations. The best part of the press release is that it says its design “uses magnetic forces to float the amp in the air to reduce internal noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFeiKo"&gt;Audiophiles reading this have every right to be skeptical that Astell &amp;amp; Kern can reproduce the effect of a tube amp with such minuscule hardware, but it at least deserves some credit for trying. Check it out in action below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lqdmIZNEYjqezZgxbkSgzwPqMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809604/astellandkern7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe5okP"&gt;When you’re using the A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T, it’ll let you switch between its OP-AMP setting for “ultra-clarity and a dynamic playback,” the tube amp mode for a “uniquely warm” sound, and a hybrid mode that blends the best of both modes into one. Additionally, this model has an ESS ES9068AS quad DAC for further enhancing the way your music sounds. This is apparently Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s first player to feature a quad DAC, as well as the Replay Gain utility, which adjusts the volume of all of your music (up to 24-bit / 192kHz) to the same level, so one song isn’t quieter than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUwgXcceOaZDdFuE7MPxTLt_rMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809612/akultima.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN7nK"&gt;Now, for some specs. The player is compatible with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 44.mm plugs. It has a five-inch 1080p touchscreen, which might be the least impressive thing about it. You can charge it and transfer files via its USB-C port. It’s also Wi-Fi ready, supporting the company’s AK File Drop utility that lets you transfer files wirelessly via PC, phone, or even an FTP on the same network. You’ll obviously get the best sound quality with a set of high-end, wired headphones or earphones, but it also supports Bluetooth 5.0 with 24-bit aptX HD and LDAC codec support. Lastly, it has 256GB of flash storage built in, but it supports up to 1TB via microSD. It has a 4,200mAh battery, which the company says will get you about nine hours of FLAC playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfGcDP"&gt;For people with the sort of budget that allows this kind of purchase, this seems like something you may want to try before you buy. It’s possible that Astell &amp;amp; Kern created something great that defies its pocket-sized stature, but it’s just as likely that this has some overly ambitious first-gen quirks to iron out. You’ll be able to find out yourself when it releases in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton drops the price of its original Bike by $400 amid poor earnings results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMjYxVYlXID8XCZM7n_57aZ2zwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784251/akrales_170407_1569_0850.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7se5A1"&gt;Peloton has &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/making-it-easier-to-become-part-of-the-peloton-community"&gt;dropped the price of its original Bike&lt;/a&gt; by $400, making it $1,495. This price reduction comes alongside the company’s 2021 financial earnings, which showed that the company grew less than expected, and lost more than it had predicted (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-pton-q4-2021-loss.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4836b73e-6e63-4517-a3cd-86c45ea98e68"&gt;The company reports&lt;/a&gt; that in the fourth quarter of its 2021 financial year, it had a net loss of just over $313 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bFYqN"&gt;While the company’s financial results certainly give it a reason to want to boost growth, this isn’t the original Peloton Bike’s first price drop. Its previous price point of $1,895 was the result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427003/peloton-new-treadmill-bike-plus-exercise-equipment-features-price"&gt;a price drop that happened&lt;/a&gt; alongside the introduction of the Bike Plus last September, which took it down from its original &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-slashes-the-price-of-its-bike-by-hundreds-of-dollars-to-1495.html"&gt;$2,245 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTVmBL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peloton says it wants to lower the barrier of entry to its workout equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RsYXp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/making-it-easier-to-become-part-of-the-peloton-community"&gt;Peloton’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Wednesday’s price drop spins it a different way, saying that the price drop is a way to allow more people into the Peloton community, lowering the barrier of entry. Of course, the Bike is at its best when paired with a $40-a-month Peloton Membership — the more bikes Peloton sells, the more memberships it’s likely to get. Given that subscription profit is one of the places the company is being successful (Peloton reports 158.9 percent year-over-year growth in subscription gross profit for Q4), it’s likely the company wants to keep riding that high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVsriN"&gt;This news also comes as Peloton is getting ready to relaunch its lower-cost treadmill (appropriately named the Tread) at the end of August. When &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/new-peloton-bike-tread/"&gt;it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, the $2,495 Tread was supposed to slot in under the more expensive Tread Plus, though Peloton currently isn’t selling that model due to a recall that stemmed from a series of injuries and one death. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;Tread Plus recall&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the separate recall that delayed the Tread’s launch, are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-pton-q4-2021-loss.html"&gt;cited by CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and Peloton as part of the reason for the company’s financial woes last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS39Jb"&gt;Peloton may also have new products on the horizon to go along with its bikes and treadmills — it appears the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634770/peloton-rower-rumors-android-app-mazu-app-analysis"&gt;finally working on its long-rumored rowing machine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545560/peloton-wearble-heart-rate-monitor-fitness"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on a heart rate monitoring armband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAjQ1D"&gt;If the Bike’s price drop has intrigued you, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15408338/bike-peloton-review-indoor-cycle-live-streaming-cycling"&gt;read our review of it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
