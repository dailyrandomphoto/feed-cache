    <title>Rivian raises another $2.5 billion as it looks to build a second factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/erm7xAkzk87V6T4xwKsMHt-F70E=/0x1:2879x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624133/rivian_r1t_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkOa1w"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian has raised another massive round of funding, this time to the tune of $2.5 billion, bringing its total raised to date over the $10 billion mark. The funding round comes as Rivian recently confirmed it’s looking for a location to build a second factory — one that will also produce batteries for its vehicles — in the United States. The company is currently aiming to roll its first electric pickup trucks off the line at its existing factory in Illinois this September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsnBtD"&gt;The new round was led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford, D1 Capital Partners, and funds advised by T. Rowe Price, each of which are already investors in Rivian. Amazon and Ford each own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the buzzy EV startup&lt;/a&gt;, and are working with Rivian on separate vehicles — Rivian is building delivery vans for Amazon, and is developing an vehicle with Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPlpg"&gt;Rivian was supposed to put its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV into production in 2020, but delayed to 2021 after the pandemic hit. A targeted June production start date for the pickup slipped to July, before getting delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;again until September&lt;/a&gt;. The SUV will now enter production sometime soon after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zubpw5"&gt;As if getting three vehicles into production at roughly the same time isn’t challenging or expensive enough, Rivian confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;this week that it’s scouting locations for a second assembly plant, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rivian-us-plant/exclusive-amazon-backed-rivian-confirms-plan-for-second-u-s-assembly-plant-idUSL1N2OX2H4"&gt;where it plans to also make battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple states are bidding on the new plant, according to the report. The company now employs some 7,000 people. Rivian is also working on an initial public offering, according to multiple reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhIBg6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers for Google Pittsburgh contractor HCL reach tentative union contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF4y2MO_xBj0EI8H_WiPNx3h9pE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622797/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tC3WNl"&gt;The United Steelworkers Union (USW) &lt;a href="https://www.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2021/usws-tentative-first-contract-with-tech-firm-hcl-improves-wages-job-security"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; it has reached a tentative contract deal with a sub-contractor for Google Pittsburgh. The announcement comes almost two years after employees of engineering and IT contractor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;HCL Technologies voted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;, saying that even though they worked alongside Google employees, they didn’t receive the same benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtTx5"&gt;Amanda Parks, a member of the USW bargaining committee who works at HCL, said in a statement that the proposed three-year contract includes “meaningful wage increases” and addresses pay parity concerns. It includes language that offers job security and additional time off, according to the statement. “We work hard, and we deserve what all workers deserve, an agreement that reflects our important contributions to the company’s success,” Parks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35BZRk"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509201/google-union-nlrb-hcl-america-offshoring-pittsburgh-organizing"&gt;filed a complaint against HCL&lt;/a&gt; in October, claiming that the company was outsourcing the Pittsburgh workers’ jobs in retaliation for union activity. According to the complaint, HCL failed to bargain with the Pittsburgh workers and transferred their work to offshore workers in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcfmZy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google’s contractor workforce&lt;/a&gt; has grown significantly over the past several years, to the point it’s nearly as large as its full-time workforce, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1FO3L"&gt;The tentative contract covers about 65 employees based in Pittsburgh and is scheduled for a ratification vote on July 30th. The contract would take effect immediately if it is ratified, the union said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlkPwm"&gt;A spokesperson for HCL confirmed the tentative agreement in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday. “Throughout this process, HCL has been actively engaged in meaningful and fair discussions with the USW in good faith,” the spokesperson said. “We have been steadfast in our commitment to respect our employees’ right to pursue unionization should they choose to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGkleH"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OGnWl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 23rd 3:31PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from HCL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max will release 10 Warner Bros. films straight-to-streaming in 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QoIKO1weHmF6sNl-zMCFQrDzWQc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623886/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUuoTO"&gt;After deciding to release its full slate of 2021 Warner Bros. films on HBO Max under a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;hybrid streaming and theatrical model&lt;/a&gt;, it appears WarnerMedia is prepared to continue using its Warner Bros. assets to lure subscribers to the service in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOVswX"&gt;During AT&amp;amp;T’s second-quarter earnings call this week, the company’s executives were asked about how the pandemic release model would shape a more permanent release strategy going forward, particularly as it relates to theaters. Citing the theatrical success of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; to the tune of $463 million in revenue, WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar responded that while “the motion picture format absolutely matters,” the company also feels “very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4cdiy"&gt;Kilar went on to say that Warner Bros. will be producing 10 films that will debut on HBO Max the same day they’re released. While it’s not clear which titles these 10 will include, the decision indicates that pandemic has significantly influenced the way that WarnerMedia will tackle its movie releases moving forward. Kilar expressly stated that the company does not plan to return to a film release strategy of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eVkPb"&gt;“I certainly don’t anticipate us going back to the way the world was in 2015 or ’16 or ’17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an a la carte transaction or something else,” Kilar said. As previously announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; when Warner Bros. reached a multi-year agreement with Cineworld for 2021 and 2022 film exhibition, Kilar confirmed that theatrical windows for “a portion of our slate” would be 45 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPlqNK"&gt;WarnerMedia faced significant backlash when it announced earlier this year that its 2021 slate of films would debut under its same-day streaming and theatrical release model. Theaters were &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;not especially pleased&lt;/a&gt;, but the strategy was also criticized by creators themselves, including directors &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/wb-hbo-max-directors-criticism-nolan-misses-point/"&gt;Christopher Nolan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/denise-villeneuve-judd-apatow-hbo-max-warner-bros.html"&gt;Denis Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;. During the earnings call, Kilar said the industry would continue to “evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtdKj1"&gt;“I think that what you’re going to see is this industry continue to evolve and to continue to innovate in ways that not only works for consumers and fans, but also works for our business partners,” Kilar said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iDOS 2 emulator gets App Store takedown notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ThwAhJXfUc8_F8wPgMVS4rjhlE=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623799/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sXrrZo"&gt;Apple may be removing &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/idos-2/id918131840"&gt;iDOS 2&lt;/a&gt;, a popular (or, at the very least, popular for a DOS emulator designed to run decades-old software and games) emulation app that allows users to run DOS games and software on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYifKw"&gt;According to the developer, &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone"&gt;Chaoji Li&lt;/a&gt;, Apple issued the notice of the pending takedown after a recently submitted update for a bug fix. While iDOS 2 has been available since 2014 on the App Store, it seems that with the most recent update, the company has changed its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu4IOM"&gt;Per the letter that Li received: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3ipJ2B"&gt;Upon re-evaluation, we found that your app is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. Specifically, we found your app is in violation of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfvJkd"&gt;Guideline 2.5.2 — Performance — Software Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoIXfN"&gt; During review, your app installed or launched executable code, which is not permitted on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13pbDM"&gt;Specifically, your app executes iDOS package and image files and allows iTunes File Sharing and Files support for importing games. Executing code can introduce or changes features or functionality of the app and allows for downloading of content without licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mPT4QF"&gt;Li had previously been forced to go four years without an update to iDOS 2 due to Apple’s restrictions on bundling game files, but he &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2020/09/idos2-update"&gt;was able to update the app&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020 with changes that enabled iDOS 2 to use iOS’s document-sharing feature to let users import their own files. An earlier version of the app, iDOS, had been briefly available on the App Store in 2010, but &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/26/idos-emulator-supports-dos-and-windows-3-0-on-ios-devices/"&gt;was pulled&lt;/a&gt; by Apple shortly after it was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppCEJu"&gt;Since that September update, Li was also able to submit a dozen other updates to his app, each without issue. Li claims to have been extremely upfront with Apple’s reviewers during each update submission, noting that while the app does run external code, it does so in a sandboxed environment (meaning there’s no security risk that could compromise user data on the rest of the operating system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9Fw6"&gt;For whatever reason, though, Apple appears to have changed its mind on enforcing this section of its App Store rules. It’s not clear what exactly has changed here, although Li speculates that a recent burst of popularity (helped by tweets from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1409191922682400770"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; tech editor Harry McCracken&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/739100/how-to-install-windows-31-on-an-ipad/"&gt;guide from &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows how the app could be used to run Windows 3.1 on an iPad) may have caused Apple’s change of heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxVcHe"&gt;Apple has given Li 14 days to update his app to remove the ability to run executable code — which would render it completely useless. Li has already said he doesn’t intend to make that change, explaining that doing so “would be a betrayal to all the users that have purchased this app specifically for those features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9nGz"&gt;For now, iDOS 2 is still available on the App Store for $4.99, but if Apple sticks to its word, it likely won’t be around to purchase for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8chx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha5fHi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A missing ampersand locked some users out of their Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 open, seen from the back, on a stone bench." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXDRiwpfv85VTWkhcOFJ2Ka1IGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623430/mchin_20190722_4563_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFdF3X"&gt;A major bug in a recent Chrome OS release (91.0.4472.147) left some users bricked out of their Chromebooks. Reddit, in due course, has already spotted the issue. As some eagle-eyed users, including one “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/onlcus/update_it_seems_google_has_pulled_the_165_stable/h5vgtxu/?context=8&amp;amp;depth=9"&gt;elitist_ferret&lt;/a&gt;” (first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/20/a-new-chrome-os-91-update-is-breaking-chromebooks-like-a-bull-in-a-china-shop/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;),&lt;/em&gt; have pointed out, the problem appears to boil down to a missing ampersand in Google’s code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBBvwE"&gt;Specifically, it seems that Google used one “&amp;amp;” in a conditional statement in its Cryptohome VaultKeyset, rather than two “&amp;amp;&amp;amp;”, which is the “AND” operator in C++, breaking up the line. The mishap prevented Chrome OS from checking user passwords against stored keys, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/google-pushed-a-one-character-typo-to-production-bricking-chrome-os-devices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, and that left some users unable to log in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMfari"&gt;Google has not yet responded to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85Px6B"&gt;The Chrome OS subreddit was aware of the bug in 91.0.4472.147 as early as the afternoon of July 19th. “The latest stable update is stopping users from logging in,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/oniply/warning_the_latest_stable_update_is_stopping/"&gt;one user wrote&lt;/a&gt; at 1:23PM ET. “We recommend that you DO NOT update until further notice.” A number of users also began &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/oniply/warning_the_latest_stable_update_is_stopping/h5ryqx0/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reporting bugs&lt;/a&gt; around that time — some complained that their devices wouldn’t accept their passwords, while others said they couldn’t even get past the boot-up screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5l2q8R"&gt;Google said that evening on its &lt;a href="https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status?start_time=1626753600000"&gt;Customer Care Portal&lt;/a&gt; that a solution would be deployed by the end of the day on July 21st, and recommended that users powerwash their devices, roll back to previous Chrome OS builds, log in with Guest Mode, or wait for the fix. By the next day, the company had identified the issue with the new build and had halted its rollout. On the 21st, it noted that a new version (91.0.4472.167) was being rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3hFPl"&gt;“The rollout will gradually release to devices over the next few days,” the update reads. “Affected devices can login via Guest Mode or an account that hasn’t signed into the device.” Once affected users have successfully signed in, they can follow the steps in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/177889?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Help Center&lt;/a&gt; to download the latest update. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram users worry a new sensitivity filter is censoring their work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQlH1KUnpqHlmLTx7kR09eYfnGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623083/acastro_210723_4678_instagramContent_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro &amp;amp; Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But Instagram downplays the changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qi5ZZ1"&gt;Instagram users around the platform share one central concern right now: that the app’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585623/instagram-sensitive-content-control-setting-explore-tab-limit-offensive-posts"&gt;sensitive content filter&lt;/a&gt; is blocking their posts. In posts on both the feed and in Stories, account holders are warning their followers that the setting is limiting their reach and that their followers should disable the filter to ensure their posts get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajZ68h"&gt;“Over the past 24 hours, I’ve had many conversations with artists and other creators who are incredibly frustrated by having their work hidden,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/phillip.miner/"&gt;Phillip Miner&lt;/a&gt;, an artist and the creator of queer hobby magazine &lt;em&gt;Natural Pursuits&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in a post. “Conversely, people are frustrated that they can’t find the content the want to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWjWwV"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRmaR0Uh637/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; of his alerting people to the filter has reached over 700,000 people and has been shared 192,000 times as of this morning, he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. People from all sorts of communities, including the art world, sex workers, tattoo artists, and the cannabis industry have picked up on it, sharing similar concerns, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jL0WsU"&gt;An account for a gun holster company makes a similar warning in its own post, saying  content about “guns” and “capitalism” might be hidden. If there’s a unifying cause on Instagram right now, it’s around the sensitivity filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A43J1Y"&gt;The sensitivity filter, which was introduced Tuesday, allows people to set limits around how much potentially sensitive content they might see on their Explore page. It’s supposed to filter out things like self-harm content, and it’s turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrbO4J"&gt;But Instagram says that creators shouldn’t worry. The app already limited the amount of sensitive content people see on their Explore page, and the default setting retains that filtering. With the options introduced Tuesday, people can now either further limit sensitive content or allow more of it to surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvmP1A"&gt;A spokesperson suggests to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some users could even see a bump in discoverability because of this change if people opt into allowing more sensitive content on their Explore page. The change will have “no impact” on what users see in their feed or in Stories, “where we will continue showing them posts from people they follow,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri2T57"&gt;Sensitive content is defined by Instagram in its “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendation Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;,” which only pertains to content that is recommended in places like Explore and IGTV Discover and is much broader than its “Community Guidelines.” Content that is considered sensitive is still allowed on the app, as opposed to content that violates its Community Guidelines, but Instagram might surface it less frequently, particularly for users who set their sensitivity limits to the lowest level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibr3UO"&gt;A spokesperson didn’t offer specifics around how much sensitive content users could expect to see in their Explore page at any of the three available settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHKvfA"&gt;Miner points out, however, that regardless of the filter, bucketing all sensitive content under one broad phrase is the bigger issue. His work often shows nudity, for example, which, if sexually explicit or suggestive, is considered sensitive by Instagram, but he says some people might be okay with nude art while also not wanting to see content that depicts violence, which also falls under sensitive content. The same could be said of tobacco-related content or content related to pharmaceutical drugs, both of which are considered sensitive content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxoMMs"&gt;“What I would love to see is, there’s so much that falls under the umbrella of sensitive content, being able to tailor your experience more,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S9voUe"&gt;Instagram clearly attempted to give people more control, but it stayed too broad, at least in Miner’s opinion. The platform also isn’t clear with people who want to disable the filter as to whether they’ll suddenly see lots of unwanted weight loss content or violent images. Though ultimately much of Instagram won’t change with this new setting, the communication about it should.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite turns monster battles into a team sport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-Xyh3SynIjahy1s396GuFDs4kQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623068/Pokemon_UNITE___Team_Up._Take_Down.___Hero_Image___1080p.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNDqmh"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; are massively popular, and have been for the better part of a decade. But they can also be impenetrable to new players and viewers: there are so many characters and strategies that figuring out what’s happening on-screen is a huge challenge. The just-launched &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; aims to fix that. It doesn’t just add cute monsters to the genre, but also some clever fixes to streamline it and make things more approachable. It’s kind of like a mashup of a strategy game and basketball, but with a Gengar thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5VkaP"&gt;For the uninitiated, a MOBA — or multiplayer online battle arena, to use the genre’s unnecessarily long full name — is a five-on-five competition where the goal, usually, is to destroy the opposing team’s base. You do this by forming a squad of characters, each with their own unique abilities, which you use to steadily destroy towers and level up so you can push your way into your opponent’s territory. It’s often slow and methodical, a genre that rewards smart decisions as well as quick reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE7jzq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; has many of these elements, including a varied cast of monsters to choose from. Charmander is a good all-around melee fighter, for instance, while Venasaur is better for ranged attacks. There are support characters and ones designed for defense. In a nice twist, many of the creatures will evolve over the course of the match. It’s fun starting out as a squat little Gible and ending the match as an imposing Garchomp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xSerpB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j86TTIMWBYY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtyYq"&gt;But the most interesting aspects of &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; are where it differs from the traditional MOBA. For starters, instead of trying to destroy your opponents’ base, you’re scoring points. To do this, you have to defeat wild pokémon that spawn throughout the arena to earn points, which you then take to one of the opponent’s goal circles to score. Drop enough points to destroy a circle and you can move on to the next. It’s similar to how MOBAs usually work, but it’s also a lot simpler to understand. And the system also adds some new drama: if you’re killed, you’ll lose a big chunk of the points you’re holding, which makes things very tense if you have a lot stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bly9x4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"League of Legends: Wild Rift makes one of the world’s biggest games more accessible","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc76u1"&gt;The other nice thing about the game is that it has a strict time limit. Whereas a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; match can stretch to close to an hour if it’s tightly contested, a single &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; match takes exactly 10 minutes. Once the timer runs down, whichever team has the most points wins. (Some matches can actually be shorter; I’ve already played a few where the other team forfeited early because of a lopsided score.) The time limit and points system make &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; feel a bit more like a virtual sport, albeit one with experience points and spawning monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hud93p"&gt;This idea of streamlining a MOBA isn’t exactly new. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/3/8712733/heroes-of-the-storm-review"&gt;Blizzard tried it with &lt;em&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Riot did something similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;when it brought &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; to mobile with the spinoff &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But, at least from what I’ve played so far, &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; seems the most approachable. The rules are easy to understand, the matches are short and intense, and the world is already something millions of people know and love. So far, the only real issue I’ve run into is the copious amounts of virtual currency you can earn or buy. It gets weirdly complicated, to the point that you can spend as much time messing around in battle pass menus as actually playing the game. It doesn’t seem like you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy anything, but some of the fashion options are pretty tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1m6gK"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; is available as a free download on the Nintendo Switch, but it’s poised to become even bigger when it debuts on mobile in September (with crossplay and cross progression at launch). Developer TiMi, an internal studio at Tencent, already operates two of the biggest games in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; and MOBA could soon add a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5Yymh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9w6H7"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where our editors discuss the biggest stories in tech news this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyKtHh"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the show is split into three sections, hosted by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Dieter Bohn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lPc2PF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqIewD"&gt;In part one, Dieter and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz chat with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom to talk about President Biden’s criticism of Facebook’s handling of misinformation on its platform, the continuing fight for the right to repair, and the nomination of Google critic Jonathan Kanter to lead the Department of Justice’s antitrust division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lS3cyC"&gt;In section two, Dieter talks with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Liz Lopatto and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; space reporter Joey Roulette about Jeff Bezos’ trip to the edge of space Tuesday morning on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOLHwu"&gt;Liz and Joey discuss details of the launch, the other members of the crew like aviation legend Wally Funk, the press conference after landing, and the backlash from the people back on Earth. Joey also describes his experience being at the launch site in person and asking Bezos some questions about pricing for these space flights. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic made it even harder to check on the ocean’s vital signs   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-SCIENCE-ARCTIC-CLIMATE-POLARSTERN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCX5sj9RF-S-c1kXTmfmlg004h8=/0x27:5517x3705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622765/1229021779.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A man takes a picture of German icebreaker and research vessel “Polarstern” upon arrival at the harbour of nothern German town of Bremerhaven, on October 12, 2020, after a year-long mission, the biggest Arctic expedition in history, bringing home observations from scientists that sea ice is melting at a “dramatic rate” in the region. - The researchers’ observations have been backed up by US satellite images showing that in 2020, sea ice in the Arctic reached its second-lowest summer minimum on record, after 2012. The Polarstern mission, dubbed MOSAIC, spent 389 days collecting data on the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and ecosystems to help assess the impact of climate change on the region and the world.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3z4Uq"&gt;After taking a hit during the pandemic, the coming months will be a crucial time for ocean research. People rely on data collected at sea for weather forecasts, understanding climate change, and keeping coastal economies afloat. To make that happen, scientists keep track of everything from the temperatures to salinity and oxygen levels in the deep. But the COVID-19 crisis interrupted research around the world, and ocean scientists are trying to recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9r9XbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The coming months will be a crucial time for ocean research&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbeMYd"&gt;“Overnight, our vessel transformed from a research ship observing a decade’s worth of ocean changes, into a simple express steam home,” Leticia Barbero, an assistant scientist at the University of Miami, said in a June 2020 &lt;a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/covid-19-disruptions-ocean-observations-could-threaten-weather-forecast-and-climate-change"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. She and her team rushed to deploy autonomous instruments to keep taking measurements for climate and weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXdzva"&gt;Despite the best efforts of Barbero and her fellow researchers, throughout 2020 and the first part of 2021, there was a 10 percent decrease in real-time data collected from the world’s ocean-observing networks, according to a &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/state-of-global-ocean-observing-system-2021-%E2%80%93-recovering-from-pandemic?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmo%2FapqD+%28World+Meteorological+Organization+News%29"&gt;report card&lt;/a&gt; recently released by the Global Ocean Observing System’s Observations Coordination Group. Some networks saw bigger losses. What’s potentially more worrying is that there was a 15 to 20 percent drop in vital maintenance operations, which could endanger more data collection moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmN1EX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Mathieu Belbéoch, a technical coordinator and lead at the OceanOPS, the joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission about what happened last year and what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGkcva"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FanKn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do scientists usually gather data in the ocean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqHydk"&gt;Some instruments are set on board ships, mainly merchant ships. That’s the historical network of the WMO. The ship captains are capturing meteorological observations and logging that. This has been modernized and all that now is shared in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv3IcT"&gt;Then there are surface drifters, that are drifting with the surface current. Many are used for meteorology. Then you have a set of moored buoys — a lot at the coastal level, but there’s also a very important network in the tropical bound in particular to monitor El Nino. And then there is the &lt;a href="https://argo.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Argo network&lt;/a&gt;, kind of a revolutionary network that was raised about 20 years ago to measure the entire water column with robots going up and down from the surface. There are 4,000 of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFWScR"&gt;All that is completed by a set of other systems — research vessels, some ocean gliders that you can steer a little bit. And also some animals are used to make measurements — elephant seals mainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kraUD7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact has the pandemic had on all of these observation networks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT34jq"&gt;It’s a question we’ve been asked a lot in the last year or so. There was clearly some impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SD52rS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to be a bit creative”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hEMwq"&gt;The main impact was the lack of ship time available, which makes our lives harder. Some ships are used to make measurements but also to deploy those buoys. So we have to be a bit creative and we have been using some sailing boats, we’ve been partnering with some skippers. The &lt;a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/about-us/history-and-r-d-milestones/volvo-ocean-race.html"&gt;Volvo nautical race&lt;/a&gt; around the world, they have been deploying instruments for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpAO7F"&gt;In terms of data, we see a little loss. One network that suffered is a network called Ship of Opportunity Program (SOOP). It’s using expendable bathythermographs, little sensors that are launched from merchant ships. Along a merchant ship route, you have an operator or an automatic system that is dropping, every hour or so, temperature probes in the ocean. This program has been degraded by 50 percent or more — or even 100 percent at some point, nothing happened for the first six months! So yes, we have lost some data there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk3xwk"&gt;A few moored buoys were not maintained in time, maybe they will be in the next six months. If not, we will start to see the different networks switching off those little points on the map one after the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgTFWe"&gt;Moored buoys in the tropics are the best tools to monitor El Nino. That system is only working at 60 percent of capacity today, although that’s not all related to COVID because there are funding challenges and other difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlxK7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your recent report card says there’s been a 10 percent overall decrease in real-time data, how might that affect research or forecasting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isqwcS"&gt;It’s tough to say, you know, what’s the price of a single observation. Some very important time series have not been done, so those data are lost forever. You are not there to take those data, so for climate recall this is a loss. For the rest of the series, you have a decrease in the accuracy of the forecast. But for now, the system is handling the shock pretty well, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJq4Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The heart of the system is autonomous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Cmt1"&gt;The heart of the system is autonomous, it’s made of autonomous instruments. Those buoys, some will last a year or two, some others will operate five or more. So when they are launched, they can operate for a long time and if the telemetry infrastructure is okay, the system will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65nXgK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you expect there to be more challenges moving forward as a result of the pandemic or have things started to go back to normal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfIYoj"&gt;The system can handle six months to a year flag — of delay of renewal. But more than that, we start to be serious. One surface drifter will live for about one year. So if you don’t go to sea for a year, you lose your entire network. And that’s the only way to get air pressure, for example. You don’t get the air pressure from satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpHq3E"&gt;This year will be critical because we accumulated a lot of deficits in deployment. So we have some stock to deploy this year, so there will be much more work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMhAgR"&gt;You know, if nobody goes to replace drifters in the Indian Ocean this year — next year, you will have very bad data in the Indian Ocean, for the monsoons and all those critical applications. The models and the services will be degraded. We’re not there yet, but the community has to work hard this year to maintain the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HODyPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maintaining the system is a kind of struggle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyE0Rb"&gt;It was already a challenge. I mean, maintaining the system is a kind of struggle. This important infrastructure for the world is funded by research at 70 percent, which means the scientists have to apply for proposals and for science projects every two, three, four years. It’s like if your highways were maintained by research, you know, you will find it very strange, because everybody needs a highway. And for the ocean-observing system, it’s the same. This critical infrastructure is maintained on short funding. So before the pandemic, the system was fragile already. And the pandemic has just kind of accelerated some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kGyXy"&gt;I would say if the delays continue again like last year, in the next six months or so, we will start to see some measurable impact. Today’s impacts are at the margin. And as I said, the heart of the system is surviving the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook brings cloud gaming to Apple devices with a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZNgi_U6Ik1Fj2r7rlmm9IQtBh4=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622505/acastro_210722_1777_facebookgaming_720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hrbq5g"&gt;Starting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="http://www.fb.gg/play"&gt;through a web app&lt;/a&gt; people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0ICjR"&gt;But thanks to Apple’s rules, it’s unclear how people will find it, since third-party developers like Facebook are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;barred from steering their app users&lt;/a&gt; to websites featuring purchasing mechanisms that aren’t Apple’s own. It’s a huge point of friction with not just Facebook, but other gaming companies like Epic that have strongly protested Apple’s grip on iOS payments. Facebook’s library of web games, which include HTML5-based ones alongside more advanced titles that stream directly from the cloud, use the social network’s custom payments system called Facebook Pay to accept in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykHrd8"&gt;Facebook’s decision to bring its game platform to iOS via the web mimics the approach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which have also released Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs, for their respective cloud gaming services to get around the App Store. Last year, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;complained loudly&lt;/a&gt; when Apple blocked its attempt to put games in a standalone app for iOS and said it would look into alternatives. Shortly after that, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;changed its rules&lt;/a&gt; to allow for cloud-based games as long as they were submitted individually as apps to the App Store for review — a policy that Microsoft and others said didn’t address their desire to release their own gaming storefronts on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8ef6Hy3DmGvzfMi12vPjLnb-7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734643/Facebook_gaming_web_app.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e1CZXB"&gt;“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ja2wpt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e575v3"&gt;Facebook isn’t a major player in gaming yet, as it has mostly focused on courting streamers to broadcast their gameplay for fans to watch. But last year it acquired a cloud gaming startup and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21528438/facebook-cloud-gaming-beta-android-web-jason-rubin-interview"&gt;released a handful of free-to-play titles&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9&lt;/em&gt;. It has since made its service available in more regions, added other titles like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;, and said 1.5 million people play its cloud games per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RID2dQ"&gt;While Facebook ultimately found a solution for getting its cloud games on iOS, there are still big limitations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;imposed by Apple’s Safari&lt;/a&gt; browser on web games. Sound is turned off by default, games can’t send push notifications, and graphics aren’t as powerful as they can be in native apps. And then there’s the problem of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1yA4z"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on its growth plans for the gaming website, but &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s rules&lt;/a&gt; say that developers can’t send users from a native app to a website with payments technology other than its own. Developers of the games Facebook features could do their own marketing, but those efforts would pale in comparison to the traffic that the main Facebook app could send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ulFZi"&gt;Facebook’s cloud games are currently available in the US and parts of Canada and Mexico, while HTML games are accessible elsewhere as cloud games are slowly brought to more regions.&lt;/p&gt;
