    <title>As Epic v. Apple approaches the courtroom, Valve is getting sued over Steam too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steam Box Header alt 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0N3Bi3b0ocvgPZlxBIRwhd7o98=/8x0:1013x670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220436/steam_box_header_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrKVAp"&gt;Just two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple gets dragged into a California court&lt;/a&gt; to justify its 30 percent App Store fee — and two days after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;axed its 30 percent cut on PC&lt;/a&gt; — we’re learning that gaming giant Valve is now facing down lawsuits against its own 30 percent cut and alleged anticompetitive practices with its PC gaming platform Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA9iFx"&gt;“Valve abuses its market power to ensure game publishers have no choice but to sell most of their games through the Steam Store, where they are subject to Valve’s 30% toll,” argues indie game developer and &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php"&gt;Humble Bundle creator&lt;/a&gt; Wolfire Games, in a lawsuit filed Tuesday (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/humble-bundle-creator-brings-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-over-steam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okv3S3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clear parallels to Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5SABB"&gt;Much like Epic v. Apple, the new suit argues that a platform owner is using an effective monopoly over the place where people &lt;em&gt;run &lt;/em&gt;their software (there, iOS; here, Steam) to dominate and tax an entire separate industry (alternative app / game stores), an industry that could theoretically flourish and produce lower prices for consumers if not for (Apple’s / Valve’s) iron grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Glk30U"&gt;Wolfire claims that Valve now controls “approximately 75 percent” of the entire PC gaming market, reaping an estimated $6 billion in annual revenue as a result from that 30 percent fee alone — over $15 million per year per Valve employee, assuming the company still has somewhere in the vicinity of the 360 employees &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-misses-deadline-to-respond-to-washington-state-gambling-regulator-but-says-its-coming-soon/"&gt;it confirmed having five years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATDBol"&gt;As to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Valve might be abusing its power, there’s a laundry list of complaints that you might want to read in full (which is why I’ve embedded the complaint below), but the arguments seem to boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zn2Kxd"&gt;Every other company’s attempt to compete with Steam has failed to make a dent, even though many of them offered developers a bigger cut of the profits, such as the Epic Game Store’s 88-percent revenue share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qm0oks"&gt;Steam doesn’t allow publishers to sell PC games and game keys for less money elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="It91Pm"&gt;That in turn means rival game platforms can’t compete on price, which keeps them from getting a foothold &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OAW0GX"&gt;Most of those rival game stores have largely given up, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937055/ea-games-steam-access-subscription-service-pc-storefront-jedi-fallen-order-sales"&gt;like how EA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;Microsoft have each&lt;/a&gt; brought their games back to Steam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TwWpGS"&gt;That ensures Steam stays the dominant platform, because companies that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have become competitors are reduced to simply feeding the Steam engine with their games or selling Steam keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2Q2R"&gt;Wolfire says that the Humble Bundle in particular has been a victim of Valve’s practices — the lawsuit claims that “publishers became more and more reluctant to participate in Humble Bundle events, decreasing the quantity and quality of products available to Humble Bundle customers,” because they feared retaliation if Humble Bundle buyers resold their Steam keys on the grey market for cheap — and though Valve once worked with Humble Bundle &lt;a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/212341218-How-to-link-your-Steam-account?mobile_site=true"&gt;on a keyless direct integration&lt;/a&gt;, the lawsuit claims that Valve abruptly pulled the plug on that partnership with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsbqq1"&gt;As you’d expect, the lawsuit doesn’t waste much ink considering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; gamers might prefer Steam to the likes of EA’s Origin or Microsoft’s Windows Store &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the simple matter of price; I’d argue most Steam competitors have been somewhat deficient when it comes to addressing PC gamers’ many wants and needs. But that doesn’t excuse Valve’s anticompetitive practices, assuming these claims are true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGDf3j"&gt;Valve didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KKMYpG"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20695071-wolfire-games-v-valve-corporation-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Wolfire Games v. Valve Corporation complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhk7YA"&gt;This isn’t the first lawsuit brought against Valve; a group of individual game buyers &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-30-new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition"&gt;filed a fairly similar complaint in January&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve embedded the new amended version of that complaint below as well. But that earlier complaint also accused game companies alongside Valve — this new one lawsuit is by a game company itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cve2Zn"&gt;Each suit is hoping to win class-action status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gm40hE"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20695227-colvin-et-al-vs-valve-corp-amended-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Colvin et al. vs. Valve Corp, amended complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udhOLu"&gt;Whether these plaintiffs succeed against Valve or no, the pressure is clearly mounting to reduce these app store fees across the industry, and Valve may have a harder time justifying them than most — it’s seemingly more dominant in the PC gaming space than either Apple or Google are in the smartphone one, even if there are far fewer PC gamers than phone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOakF9"&gt;Valve also hasn’t necessarily made a huge concession to game developers so far. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;Valve did adjust its revenue split to give bigger companies more money,&lt;/a&gt; reducing its 30 percent cut to 25 percent after a developer racks up $10 million in sales, and down to 20 percent after they hit $50 million. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;Apple and Google drop their cuts to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for developers with under $1 million in sales, theoretically helping smaller developers instead of bigger ones.) But the Epic Games Store only takes 12 percent, and Microsoft’s Windows Store just copied that lead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;by dropping its 30 percent cut to 12 percent as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSDYir"&gt;The EU may also add additional pressure in the future; yesterday, European Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager revealed it would also “take an interest in the gaming app market” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;following its conclusion that Apple has broken EU antitrust laws &lt;/a&gt;around music streaming apps. The European Commission already has Valve on its radar, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240330/valve-steam-geo-blocking-european-commission-eu-fine-bandai-namco-capcom-focus-home-zenimax"&gt;it fined the company earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for geo-blocking game sales.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newsmax apologizes to employee of Dominion Voting Systems over false election accusations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twOsONtJWnZyTK4DNlnkzGXBf9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220249/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnBX7N"&gt;Conservative news channel Newsmax has posted an apology to an employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after it reported without evidence that he was involved in manipulating results of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lcIks"&gt;“On behalf of Newsmax, we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family,” &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/eric-coomer-dominion-voting-systems/2021/04/30/id/1019671/"&gt;a statement posted to Newsmax’s website states&lt;/a&gt;. According to the statement, there was no substance to the allegations made about Eric Coomer, Dominion’s director of product strategy and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bcWHOe"&gt;“Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump’s lawyers, supporters and others that Dr. Coomer played a role in manipulating Dominion voting machines, Dominion voting software, and the final vote counts in the 2020 presidential election, Newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true. Many of the states whose results were contested by the Trump campaign after the November 2020 election have conducted extensive recounts and audits, and each of these states certified the results as legal and final.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ39JX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/dominion-worker-eric-coomer-sues-trump-campaign-conservative-media-n1252205"&gt;Coomer filed a lawsuit in December&lt;/a&gt; against Newsmax, One America News Network, the Trump campaign, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and other people and groups that spread the false reports that Coomer had somehow rigged the election against the former president. His &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484940/Complaint_20201222_Eric_Coomer_Suit.pdf"&gt;attorneys wrote in their complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Coomer had been “vilified and subjected to an onslaught of offensive messages and harassment” as a result of the false claims. Coomer was forced to go into hiding following numerous death threats, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAG7zf"&gt;In its statement, Newsmax said that it had  “found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so. Nor has Newsmax found any evidence that Dr. Coomer ever participated in any conversation with members of ‘Antifa,’ nor that he was directly involved with any partisan political organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNrUwi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/newsmax-apologizes-to-dominion-worker-for-false-allegations/2021/04/30/39945c04-a9f9-11eb-a8a7-5f45ddcdf364_story.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Coomer has dropped Newsmax from his lawsuit, and his attorney confirmed that Coomer had reached a settlement agreement with the network, but declined to disclose the terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeGqIX"&gt;Despite the glut of conspiracy theories, there has been no evidence there was any manipulation of November’s election results. &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"&gt;According to a November 13th statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the November 3rd election “was the most secure in American history.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUiI_MPTLosJoewIUa2j5t8SLnw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69219619/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGe68"&gt;Apple has hotly contested that interpretation of the data. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s chief compliance officer said at a congressional hearing last month that “we don’t have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store,” and that Cook has made similar statements about the App Store and how it’s structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8YE6T"&gt;An Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that Barnes’ figures were incorrect: “Epic’s experts calculations of the operating margins for the App Store are simply wrong and we look forward to refuting them in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wd8x"&gt;The question of how much profit Apple makes from the app store is at the center of the ongoing court case between Apple and Epic Games. Epic argues that the App Store provides no real service, but simply serves as a way for Apple to extract money from developers. Epic is suing Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;for antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt; on those grounds, after launching an unauthorized in-app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;payments system for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. But Apple insists the App Store review process is a pivotal part of the broader platform safety efforts around iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsHN3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484567/schmalensee_testimony.pdf"&gt;Court documents show Apple’s expert witness Richard Schmalensee&lt;/a&gt; also disputed Barnes/Epic’s figures. “Mr. Barnes’ estimate of the App Store’s operating margin is unreliable because it looks in isolation at one segment of the iOS ecosystem in a way that artificially boosts the apparent operating margin of that segment,” Schmalensee said in his written direct testimony. “When one looks at Apple’s device and services ecosystem as a whole, the operating margin falls to an unremarkable level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un5tXR"&gt;Schmalensee further testified that “it makes no sense” to try to measure the App Store’s profitability in isolation since it’s part of the iOS platform and relies on all of Apple’s intellectual property. “As top Apple executives will testify, Apple does not calculate P&amp;amp;Ls by products and services because they view it as an unproductive exercise,” according to Schmalensee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Iroz"&gt;Court proceedings for the trial are due to begin on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California appeals court finds Amazon responsible for third party sellers’ products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VZB0njmuI4Qv0iAMUtXOJySSPI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218814/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PXCby"&gt;An appeals court in California has ruled that Amazon can be held liable for products sold through its marketplace by a third-party seller, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-04-29/column-amazon-product-safety-ruling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367966/amazon-liable-defective-products-california-marketplace-third-party"&gt;second major case in California&lt;/a&gt; where an appeals court has rejected Amazon’s long-held position that it is merely an intermediary between buyers and its third-party sellers. Amazon collectively refers to these sellers as its “Amazon Marketplace” even though it’s not a separate or distinct part of Amazon’s website. Third-party sellers’ products typically appear in Amazon listings, with a small line of text to indicate that Amazon itself is not the actual seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1iZvC"&gt;At issue was the case of a woman who suffered burn injuries after a hoverboard she purchased on Amazon in 2015 via a third party merchant caught on fire. Amazon argued that it was merely the platform connecting customers with sellers, but the appeals court found there was a “direct link in the vertical chain of distribution under California’s strict liability doctrine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cezcp1"&gt;Christopher Dolan, an attorney for the plaintiff in the hoverboard case, said in a statement that the ruling was a major victory for consumers. “Amazon can’t escape liability for defective products it sells to consumers by claiming it is not involved in the marketing, sale and distribution of goods and is just an ‘advertiser,’” Dolan said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wgf74"&gt;Last August, the California Fourth District Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21758700/Bolger_Opinion_8_13_20.pdf"&gt;reversed a 2019 trial court ruling&lt;/a&gt;, reinstating claims from a woman who says she suffered third-degree burns when a defective laptop battery she bought from a third-party seller on Amazon caught fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAB2nJ"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. A spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; that it “invests heavily in the safety and authenticity of all products offered in our store, including proactively vetting sellers and products before being listed, and continuously monitoring our store for signals of a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Netflix executive convicted of money laundering</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzYZzt"&gt;A former Netflix executive was convicted of taking bribes and kickbacks from vendors doing business with the company, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-netflix-executive-convicted-receiving-bribes-and-kickbacks-companies-contracting"&gt;according to the US Department of Justice. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uh8mBU"&gt;Michael Kail, who was Netflix’s vice president of information technology operations from 2011 to 2014, was found guilty by a jury of money laundering, and wire and mail fraud. According to the DOJ, Kail used his position at the company to “unlock a stream of cash and stock kickbacks” for himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHHx84"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-26/netflix-claims-former-executive-took-kickbacks-on-sales"&gt;Netflix sued Kail in 2014&lt;/a&gt; claiming he hid payments from vendors by directing them to his personal consulting company. According to the DOJ, Kail accepted bribes totaling more than $500,000, as well as stock options from nine tech companies that provided products or services to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcnKea"&gt;Kail’s attorney Julia Mezhinsky Jayne said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they were disappointed in the verdict, which she called “inexplicable and clearly unsupported by the actual evidence and the law.” They plan to appeal. Jayne said Kail was “a tremendous asset to Netflix and helped drive their success as a cutting-edge technology company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6OSzB"&gt;Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is like an epic yet enigmatic novel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_uCXy7p6URGi9xhDa93exkeHJG0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218341/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Studio ZA/UM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="12nuhP"&gt;At some point during my time with &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, after I read yet another minutes-long dialogue sequence to try and learn more information about the game’s murder mystery, I realized I felt like I was slowly working my way through a long novel — one that went just a little bit over my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvtgct"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;, an enhanced version of the 2019 cult hit role-playing game that made its console debut on PlayStation in March, you play as a cop with amnesia investigating a murder case about a hanged man. You’ll explore a fictional place called Revachol and talk to a huge cast of characters to piece together clues about the hanged man’s killer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1L8i"&gt;Almost every conversation or interaction has an extensive dialogue tree, allowing you to respond to or direct a conversation in ways that can influence other moments in the game down the line. One time, I convinced somebody to give me the jacket off their back, which I could then wear. With another person, I refused money so that my character wouldn’t feel indebted to him.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wJlnjoilJd72csXl7d0IZ0rEgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481851/image__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A conversation in &lt;/em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9QzQM"&gt;Occasionally, these interactions can drag on, feeling a bit like a book chapter that just won’t end. But the game’s writing is sharp and often quite funny, which usually made all of the reading worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFY5tz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; takes place in what I imagine as a parallel universe to ours. Characters frequently reference countries, races, and historical figures that don’t exist in our world but who are core to the societal and ideological makeup. While &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium’s&lt;/em&gt; incredible depth of historical detail made Revachol feel like a real place, at times I struggled to keep facts and information straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQDCko"&gt;You won’t just be talking to other people, though: any one of 24 different parts of your personality, like your sense of logic, composure, or authority, can butt into conversations to discuss and debate what’s going on, sometimes even with each other. It’s kind of like Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;, if it was a murder mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UwjVM"&gt;But like the historical details packed into the game, these traits can also have their own inscrutability. During my playthrough, one attribute sometimes relayed short stories about other police officers. Another, as far as I could tell, was something like a sixth sense about Revachol itself. As each one of your personalities jumps in, you’ll have more text to read. Usually, they add useful context, but other times, I wish they wouldn’t have said anything at all so that I could get to the next part of the game sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OazL4JJa4CKUllr-sXoFH7W-kkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481865/image__2_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Studio ZA/UM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your personalities in &lt;/em&gt;Disco Elysium.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NodeEn"&gt;You can also level up each of them as “skills” to give you advantages during the game. I put a lot of points into my empathy skill, for example, which meant that Empathy (the character) would often chime in with advice about how to respond empathetically in a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krdt8y"&gt;Putting points into skills also helps with “checks,” where the game rolls a virtual dice to determine if you succeed at an important action. (Saying the right thing in a conversation can help with the potential success of a check, too.) You can retry most failed checks by leveling up a specific skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bYeQ8"&gt;Some checks can only be attempted once, though, and I liked those the best — I always held my breath while I waited to see if I had succeeded or failed. They also felt like they had the most impact on the story itself, particularly near the end, where a dice roll can mean the difference between someone living or dying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8Xih7d9U04yUgHxwBNqxJ95thk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481879/image__3_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Studio ZA/UM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A check in &lt;/em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FjvEdW"&gt;Overall, the game’s systems make for a fun twist on typical role-playing mechanics. Instead of leveling up external skills like magic power or speed, it really feels like you’re building your character’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce20PS"&gt;Developer Studio ZA/UM added some new features to the original game, which was first released in October 2019, for &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;. Every line is now fully voiced, and the acting is consistently excellent. There are some new quests that let you explore your character’s political ideologies. And &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt; marks the game’s first appearance on consoles, hitting PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. (It’s coming to Xbox consoles and Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2021/2/8/22260324/disco-elysium-winter-games-preview-march-2021"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.) The game was a bit buggy for me on PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368053/disco-elysium-final-cut-ps-4-5-bugs-update-studio-zaum"&gt;especially at launch&lt;/a&gt;, but Studio ZA/UM has released several patches that have fixed the majority of issues I ran into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDMwH"&gt;Bugs weren’t the only thing that detracted from my experience, though. The game punts you to a short loading screen every time you transition to a new area, which got annoying over the course of the 24 hours I spent with it. Getting to the quests menu takes three button presses. And the text is very small, even on the largest setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8x9HiA"&gt;But if you’re willing to immerse yourself into the world of Revachol and put up with some small annoyances along the way, &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; tells a satisfying story that I really enjoyed. Like a huge, epic novel, the game can at times be enigmatic, opaque, and a little too long. But as is often the case for those kinds of stories, it’s well worth slogging through the boring stuff to see the game all the way to its fantastic end. I’m glad I read this one all the way through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpmCVa"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on PS4, PS5, PC, Mac, and Stadia. It’s set to release on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Nintendo Switch later this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida bill would fine social media platforms for banning politicians— with exemption for Disney</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jk9T3HNt7XfRqHyNQFwcn_uarBQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218332/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AcOSH8"&gt;Florida is on the verge of passing &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072/BillText/e1/HTML"&gt;legislation that would fine&lt;/a&gt; social media companies like Twitter and Facebook that “knowingly de-platform” political candidates. The bill was first &lt;a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/gov-desantis-holds-press-conference-from-florida-state-capitol/"&gt;proposed in February by Gov. Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of former President Trump, although &lt;a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-news/article/21151908/floridas-big-tech-crackdown-bill-goes-to-desantis-but-with-a-special-exemption-for-disney"&gt;Florida Republicans insist&lt;/a&gt; the bill has nothing to do with the former president, a famous denizen of social media who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by major platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQC0gc"&gt;The Florida House of Representatives passed &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072"&gt;SB 7072 by a vote of 77 to 38&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, after the state Senate voted Monday to pass the measure. The bill now goes back to the Senate to approve some of the changes made by the House; the Senate’s version called for fines of $10,000 per day for banning a political candidate and $100,000 if the candidate was running for election. The House version bumped the daily fines to $25,000 and $250,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYbuf5"&gt;The law wouldn’t apply to temporary social media bans on a candidate, and wouldn’t apply to instances where a platform removes specific posts that violate that platform’s terms of service. But any social media ban that lasts longer than 60 days would result in a fine, and, the platforms would have to make available to users any content the candidate posted before their account became inactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9HvSM"&gt;The bill also contains a very &lt;a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-news/article/21151908/floridas-big-tech-crackdown-bill-goes-to-desantis-but-with-a-special-exemption-for-disney"&gt;Florida-specific exemption&lt;/a&gt; for any “information service, system, internet search engine, or access software provider operated by a company that owns and operates” a theme park or large entertainment complex. Republican state Rep. Blaise Ingoglia said that exemption was included so that the Disney Plus streaming service “isn’t caught up in this.”  The Disney World park in Orlando brings in &lt;a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/07/09/disney-reopening-slow-step-toward-new-normal"&gt;significant tax revenue&lt;/a&gt; for the state of Florida, which relies heavily on tourism dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBRlVJ"&gt;SB 7072 also bars social media platforms from restricting “journalistic enterprises,” which the bill defines as entities that do business in Florida and have at least 100,000 monthly active users or 50,000 paid subscribers. And the bill includes provisions for conservatives’ favorite social media bogeyman: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/twitter-shadow-ban-republicans-bug"&gt;shadow-banning&lt;/a&gt;, which it defines rather opaquely as “action by a social media platform, through any means, whether the action is determined by a natural person or an algorithm, to limit or eliminate the exposure of a user or content or material posted by a user to other users of the social media platform.” Users must be allowed to opt out of shadow banning, and platforms can’t shadow ban political candidates or news websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LV1MBr"&gt;Republican supporters of SB 7072 say the measure is intended to protect the free speech rights of Florida residents and “is not about President Trump.” But the bill’s provisions seem tailored to GOP grievances about social media and the 2020 presidential election. Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and other social media platforms for inciting the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaT08R"&gt;And in October, Republicans called foul after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation"&gt;Facebook and Twitter restricted the reach&lt;/a&gt; of a disputed story in the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; about President Biden’s son Hunter (Twitter CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542801/twitter-lifts-ny-post-ban-policy-changes"&gt;Jack Dorsey later called the platform’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to suspend the &lt;em&gt;NY Post&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account “a mistake.”). The new Florida legislation would appear to address these issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZdne2"&gt;Florida Democrats called the bill a “political agenda feeding into a political base.” Democratic &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-nsf-social-media-crackdown-negotiation-20210428-httqge5xljhhfhvqsz4g4gjjny-story.html"&gt;state Rep. Joe Geller&lt;/a&gt; said it was “wrong for the government to impose speech on private businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN824p"&gt;The bill is now in the hands of the Florida Senate, and Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign it when it reaches his desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQce7i"&gt;Disney and Facebook didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment Saturday. Twitter declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New vaccine perks: halftime shots and savings bonds  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman holds a child on her lap, while a healthcare worker prepares to give the woman a COVID-19 vaccine injection. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV520pc5WJeJpW9ftXhLkBiywc4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218119/1232610818.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rTXg8F"&gt;If you’re one of the few thousand people heading to see the Milwaukee Bucks play the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, May 2nd, you have a chance to get a very special souvenir during the game — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407753/covid-vaccine-milwaukee-bucks-arena-nba"&gt;your first dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. The unusual vaccination drive is part of a host of new efforts across the US to get people their shots, whether that’s by bribing them with savings bonds in West Virginia or hosting vaccine clinics at professional basketball games in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL6fUl"&gt;In the US, vaccine supplies are high, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399889/vaccine-supply-demand-antivirus-newsletter-covid"&gt;demand is starting to taper off&lt;/a&gt;, as my colleague Nicole Wetsman wrote last week. That means that people are getting a lot more creative about ways to convince people to get their shots. You know, in case the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/free-beer-for-getting-covid-vaccine-budweiser-samuel-adams"&gt;free beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/03/22/covid-vaccine-free-donuts-krispy-kreme-vaccination-card-freebie/4750302001/"&gt;free doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;, and the chance to be protected against a virus that’s disrupted the world aren’t quite enough.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3r0EJ"&gt;Some places are hoping that money will help sweeten the deal. West Virginians between the ages of 16 and 35 who get vaccinated will be eligible to receive a $100 savings bond from the government. It would cost the government about $27.5 million to give those savings bonds to all &lt;a href="https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2021/Pages/COVID-19-UPDATE-Gov.-Justice-West-Virginia-offering-100-savings-bond-to-residents-age-16-to-35-who-get-vaccinated.aspx"&gt;380,000 eligible young people&lt;/a&gt; in the state. That’s a lot, but only about half of what the state has spent on COVID-19 testing in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ttkgs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It would be such a drop in the bucket compared to the ungodly amount of money we’re spending right now,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3zf16l"&gt;“It would be such a drop in the bucket compared to the ungodly amount of money we’re spending right now,” Governor Jim Justice &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/27/west-virginia-vaccine-savings-bonds/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The state is trying to get at least 70 percent of its eligible population vaccinated. More than 78 percent of West Virginia residents older than 65 have gotten their shot, but other age groups are lagging. That’s why the savings bonds are focused on younger people, who are less likely to have gotten the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzoNwZ"&gt;“Our kids today probably don’t really realize just how important they are in shutting this thing down,” Justice &lt;a href="https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2021/Pages/COVID-19-UPDATE-Gov.-Justice-West-Virginia-offering-100-savings-bond-to-residents-age-16-to-35-who-get-vaccinated.aspx"&gt;said in a press conference&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m trying to come up with a way that’s truly going to motivate them – and us – to get over the hump.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tk6rMp"&gt;West Virginia isn’t alone in considering financial benefits to improve vaccination rates. Grocery chain Kroeger is &lt;a href="https://www.wave3.com/2021/02/06/kroger-offering-employees-who-get-covid-vaccine/"&gt;offering its employees $100&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated. Several colleges and universities are offering gift cards, or&lt;a href="https://here.nd.edu/news/father-jenkins-covid-vaccination-update/"&gt; other financial incentives&lt;/a&gt; to their students if they get vaccinated. For some people who have been watching the course of the pandemic, the fact that so many groups are resorting to those measures is pretty depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q9wUOA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We look like a nation of adolescents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="292F63"&gt;“The fact that we as a country have to beg or pay or bribe people right now to take this lifesaving vaccine, the optics are awful internationally. We look like a nation of adolescents, especially at a time when India, Africa and most of the world are clamoring for more vaccine supply,” Peter Hotez &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/27/west-virginia-vaccine-savings-bonds/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. Hotez, a vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine, thought the promotions were good ideas but found it unfortunate that they would be needed at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoJ8Qu"&gt;It may be unfortunate, but it’s a strategy that has been shown to work before. In the 1950s, efforts to get teens vaccinated focused on similar exclusive benefits — among other promotions, &lt;a href="https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/56614/1/Mawdsley_CSH2016_salk_hops_teen_health_activism_fight_against_polio.pdf"&gt;dances called ‘Salk Hops’&lt;/a&gt; were only open to people who had gotten the polio vaccine. More recently, flu vaccinations increased significantly on campus when students were offered $30 to get a shot, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268115001079"&gt;according to a paper&lt;/a&gt; authored by economist Erin Bronchetti in 2015. The same could hold true today, with a different vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="lPDOJb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz8EEB"&gt;“A financial incentive is helping to compensate people — students, in this case — for the benefit that they’re providing for their society or their college campus by getting vaccinated,” Bronchetti &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/04/20/it-ethical-pay-students-get-vaccinated"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April. “In that way, a financial incentive for vaccination seems like a perfectly ethical and fair thing to do. It’s rewarding people for this contribution to the public good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXi9Xa"&gt;Enticements are still outliers in the vaccine drive, and many more groups are taking approaches similar to the Milwaukee Health Department and their partnership with the Bucks. They’re more focused on making vaccines as accessible as possible by meeting people where they are; setting up mobile vaccine drives to take the vaccines into people’s homes, their neighborhoods, or even to a basketball game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjcAVA"&gt;As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/30/politics/white-house-100-million-fully-vaccinated/index.html"&gt;100 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US are fully vaccinated, and more than 1.13 billion shots have been given around the world. That’s pretty incredible for just five months &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/uk-to-rollout-covid-vaccine-tuesday.html"&gt;since the first public rollout&lt;/a&gt;. But there are still billions more people to vaccinate. It will take everything we’ve got — more supplies, more money, and more creativity — to give everyone at least a chance at vaccination.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZNyLH"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mJszCp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="6bEuo2"&gt;The UK’s Recovery Trial was a massive effort to find existing drugs that could treat COVID-19. Incredibly, it worked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The story is part of Vox’s ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22381700/pandemic-playbook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pandemic Playbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a series that looks at how countries both succeeded and failed during the pandemic.

&lt;p id="cXqBsL"&gt;“Animals’ health is ours, ours is theirs, theirs is ours.” Maggie Koerth writes. As the pandemic continues, scientists are trying to figure out what animals might be in danger of catching SARS-CoV-2 from humans. This is a fascinating read into a process called ‘reverse zoonosis’ and the scientists who are trying to balance the risks of transmission with the need for research.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Maggie Koerth/&lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TU3Rcd"&gt;This week, a regulatory agency in Brazil unanimously &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/brazil-health-regulator-rejects-russia-s-sputnik-vaccine-1.5403539"&gt;rejected Russia’s Sputnik V&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. Over at &lt;em&gt;Stat,&lt;/em&gt; noted virologist Angela Rasmussen explains why — and what’s happening now.  (Damian Garde and Meg Tirrell/&lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wcr5xx"&gt;This is a visual journey through the vaccine manufacturing process, starting with the bacteria that produce DNA containing coronavirus genes, making its way through a rigorous testing process, and ending up with the finished vaccine getting shipped out and administered.

&lt;p id="VXLLGc"&gt;India is dealing with a horrifying surge in both cases and deaths. The US has agreed to send 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to countries around the world, including India, but much more will need to be done to stem the tide of the pandemic there. (Dan Vergano/&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sKRpge"&gt;New research from the CDC shows that vaccines are already working well. For people over 65, a full course of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines has reduced the risk of hospitalization by 94 percent. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which was approved later, was not included in this particular study. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9hwGuD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XTQSfy"&gt;Many people adopted a pet during the COVID-19 pandemic. My wife and I just lost one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AJadwA"&gt;Jay Peters writes movingly about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399787/isolation-grief-pandemic-covid19-mental-health"&gt;experience of grief &lt;/a&gt;during a pandemic for &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fJZLw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0a6M4i"&gt;“It was like being back in normality, but it gave you a false sense of what was going on in the world...It was as if Covid hadn’t happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="f3fr6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OFpwOl"&gt;It wasn’t the first time I saw someone die in front of me but this one stung the most. I was conflicted about taking the dead man’s photo, but then I told myself I’m a journalist and must do my job. I haven’t been able to sleep much since that day. When you come back home from witnessing death and dread, what do you do? I have images of dead bodies, crematoriums and burial grounds playing in my head all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="yZa3Cd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P2rXyI"&gt;To the people who have received the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;1.13 billion vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrgH9Q"&gt;To the more than 151,481,961 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsHH6r"&gt;To the families and friends of the 3,182,545 people who have died worldwide — 576,234 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XSjs1"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Enjoy these limited-time tech and gaming discounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple iMac (2021)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGvEQd8G6B2pQnPI9JeMgCqAQSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218028/appleimac2021hero2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvskRD"&gt;We’ve reached the weekend, and the start of another month. Sayonara, April, and hello to May. The past few days at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been some of the best tech deals so far this year, like the now-expired deal that knocked $150 off the Apple Watch Series 6, putting it lower in price than even the Apple Watch SE. That one sold out in just a few hours, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJFs3"&gt;Not all of the best sales of the week have ended. You can save on PC games in celebration of Golden Week in Japan, and get $80 off a Google Nest Wifi bundle, to name a couple of examples. Find even more below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VFw4lY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEG4do"&gt;Save up to $147 on a preorder of a new M1 iPad Pro or iMac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QP5Tpi"&gt;Apple announced that the new iPad Pro and the colorful iMacs will begin shipping on May 21st. You can preorder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date"&gt;all of those here&lt;/a&gt;. But you’d like to save some money on preordering, right? The site Expercom is hosting exclusive deals, knocking as much as $147 off preorders of the new 11-inch iPad Pro or iMac. These might not last for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VZ0s4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="aGiMyZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jdM9nn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3zMi8Y"&gt;Save $80 on a Google Nest Wifi bundle through Saturday, May 1st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PCzbhy"&gt;For the rest of Saturday, May 1st, Adorama is hosting a great deal on Google’s Nest Wifi router and a Point extender. You can get it for $189, which is $80 less than the bundle usually costs. Just enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRAOFF80 &lt;/strong&gt;at the checkout page to save. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXoyYL"&gt;With these two mesh Wi-Fi devices running in tandem, you should be able to blanket your apartment or home in reliable wireless coverage. Outside of a sale, the router usually costs $169 itself, with the Point costing another $149, so you’re saving a considerable amount of cash. This deal will end Saturday, May 1st, at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2K6oVM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Vsg8VG"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Nier: Automata" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttSRLBHowWAkiO3JbNe19_FNHvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7481763/NieR_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Platinum Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vN6Xk8"&gt;Get PC games on sale in celebration of Golden Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qjgbMW"&gt;If you aren’t busy enough plowing through your backlog and want some new games on Steam, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/goldenweek"&gt;check out the store’s Golden Week sale&lt;/a&gt;, lasting through May 6th at 1PM ET. There are too many games on sale to list here, but a few of the standouts include &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; for $24 (usually $60), &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt; for $14 (usually $20), several games in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza &lt;/em&gt;franchises, &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; for $20 (usually $40), and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="M7PXNX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5DEK7"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are back down to $278&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bFT9nS"&gt;Sony’s excellent flagship wireless headphones are easy to recommend because of their great sound quality, effective noise cancellation, long-lasting battery life, and comfort. I personally think those features are worth paying the full asking price ($349) for. But, the whole reason why I’m mentioning them in this newsletter is because they’re $72 cheaper than usual at a few retailers — likely for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Omoq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ObMXqY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HwfMbr"&gt;This Switch Pro controller includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Oi4Gt"&gt;At Walmart, you can snag the best controller available for the Switch, Nintendo’s Switch Pro, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-with-Super-Mario-Odyssey-Full-Game-Download-Code%2F925436036&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $100&lt;/a&gt;. As for why it’s that price instead of its regular $69, well, it comes with a digital download of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch, a $60 value on its own. So, this deal is like paying just $50 for each of them, saving $30 on the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6nfQ9i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10057685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new prime lenses are the small saviors I’ve been looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7xAVBtFM6C9CuNhytSsU7lze4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217934/BFARSACE_042221_4548_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony’s newest lenses are three new compact primes lenses that each cost $600.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItS4cR"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are three new compact prime lenses that each cost $599.99 and will be shipping in mid-May. While they uphold the reputation of quality Sony has established with the G lineup, it’s their uniformity and small size that come as a welcomed surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExaDUW"&gt;Uniformity and size are so rarely a topic of discussion in regards to lenses. As a video-first creator, 67mm, 77mm, and 82mm are common thread sizes in my gear bag. But it feels like with every new lens I buy I have to factor in the cost of a new ND filter or a step-up or down ring. These three new lenses all conveniently share the same 49mm filter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFPPDj"&gt;Then there is weight and size. It’s no secret that bags with full-frame camera gear are heavy, and lenses play no small role in that. But this new trio of lenses are small and light enough to fit in a compact bag or even your jacket pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9epSVmSbsILKVxT_t8TZJudL9uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476009/BFARSACE_042221_4548_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All three of the new Sony prime FE lenses are the same height and width.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGfhMB"&gt;Each of these lenses features an aperture click toggle, an autofocus toggle, a programmable button, and an aperture and focus ring. They are all weather-sealed and are 2.5 inches (64mm) in diameter while only 1.8 inches (45mm) tall. This uniformity is especially helpful when balancing a camera on a gimbal, where often the gimbal will need to be rebalanced with each lens swap. I was able to balance my A7C on a Zhiyun Crane M2 with the 24mm attached then easily change to the 50mm for tighter shots without having to rebalance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gFLuY-fXKd-OvaHuBdZvcjZa2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476011/BFARSACE_042221_4548_09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an aperture click switch on the right-hand side of each lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y05OuLG00GXwA83tQAA7Hc4YmXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476012/BFARSACE_042221_4548_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each lens has a focus switch on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qz37Cj"&gt;The weight also plays an important role here. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crane-M2-Stabilizer-Mirrorless-Smartphone/dp/B07VHCT873?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zhiyun Crane M2&lt;/a&gt; is a $200 handheld gimbal designed for phones, action cameras, and point-and-shoot cameras. The 24mm f/2.8 weighs 162g (5.71oz), the 40mm f/2.5 is 173g (6.10oz), and the 50mm f/2.5 is 174g (6.13oz). Add the 50mm, the heaviest of the three lenses, to the 509g A7C, and at 683g, I was still under the Crane M2’s 720g (1.58lb) weight limit. That left me enough headroom to put my Rode VideoMicro mic on the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZKTHzW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony A7C Review: small camera, big sensor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21497207/sony-a7c-review-camera-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="csFXso"&gt;A full-frame camera with a full-frame lens on a gimbal that small is truly remarkable, and my arms are forever grateful. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zhiyun Crane M2 is rated for cameras up to 720g (1.58lb).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5PEaH_hKZ96g_HFY5B4Y1RqVds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476016/BFARSACE_042221_4548_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to mount a shotgun mic onto my camera without going over the gimbal’s weight limit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8kpRXA"&gt;Because there are typically fewer lens elements in a prime lens than a zoom lens, they are often sharper and have less &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fphotography%2Fdiscover%2Fchromatic-aberration.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22407694%2Fsony-g-master-24-40-50-prime-lens-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chromatic aberration&lt;/a&gt;. Primes also usually have wider aperture that can let in more light or provide more creative control over the depth of field in an image. At f/2.8 and f/2.5 maximum apertures, none of these three lenses will win contests for the blurriest bokeh or the most light-gathering ability. But on a full-frame Sony camera, they provide enough separation between subjects and pleasingly blurry backgrounds. Overall, they all capture sharp images with a soft, painterly focus falloff. Although I didn’t have any other primes lenses within the $600 price range to compare them to, I was impressed with the sharpness throughout the aperture range and the lack of chromatic aberration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="7b95sf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 50mm f/2.5 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="5ENAfA"&gt;For a head-to-head comparison between these new Sony primes and other lenses within this price range, check out the great video &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Hdu7xIzSypk"&gt;Gerald Undone&lt;/a&gt; put together. It covers everything from chromatic aberration to minimum focusing distance with a decent amount of pixel peeping for the nitpick-y among us. While I agree that the bokeh from the Sony primes shows a bit too much of their blades at higher apertures, I don’t find the chromatic aberration on the Sony 40mm and 50mm to be noticeable enough in real-world shots to be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zZ5GDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10471003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="mYg3eo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 40mm f/2.5 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="6vuABY"&gt;During my time with these three lenses, I shot with the 24mm the most. When shooting in RAW, this 24mm has just the right amount of warp at the edges that both gives power to the subject and brings the viewer’s eye to the center of the frame. This is exactly the effect I am looking for from a wide-angle lens, but for folks who prefer a more linear image this may be off-putting. It is a great lens for selfies and architecture. I could also see myself using this lens for vlogging, when I need to capture both me and my environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gp6Fic"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10471028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="SIgXWD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 24mm f/2.8 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="3P4UED"&gt;The 40mm’s and 50mm’s focus falloff is even and quite stunning. When opened up to f/2.5, the maximum aperture, the background is blurred to the point of gooeyness. And while the 40mm can handle portraits, it’s also just wide enough to work for certain landscape shots, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C7PVkE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10470984"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIMMmE"&gt;Each lens has dual linear motors for fast and quiet autofocus, which is perfect for shooting video. There is a bit of focusing breathing, but it’s not regular enough to be a problem. I wish the minimum focus distance was a bit closer, though, especially on the 24mm where the nearest it can focus is 9.4 inches (24cm). The $550 Sigma 24mm f/3.5 has a 4.25-inch (10.8cm) minimum focus distance, and when taking photos of flowers, for example, this close focus can bring a viewer into the flower, a place we rarely are. It’s hard to pull that shot off with the Sony lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYkmNwbqTjL1NzKskp6DCSBYQR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476013/BFARSACE_042221_4548_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to pack my Sony A7C, with one of the three lenses attached, and the two remaining primes all into my fanny pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krXsYEHEEXHG8xpgKFVeT8E1ZOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476014/BFARSACE_042221_4548_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bag closed easily and had room to spare for hand sanitizer and my wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ru0x0"&gt;Although these primes are far from the least expensive in their category, what made me love shooting with them is their uniform size without compromising controls available at the click of a button, quality, or weather seal. I can switch between them without having to rebalance my gimbal or really even adjust to different controls — they all feel the same on the front of my camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZJNfH"&gt;Sony finally has given me an experience I have yet to have with a G lens: portability. Taking three prime lenses on a walk is something I never do because a single zoom lens saves space and weight. But with these three lenses, I was able to carry a single fanny pack and not feel burdened by the weight of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAaU6a"&gt;On the video front, I welcome three lenses that all share the same filter thread so I don’t have to deal with multiple sets of step-up or down rings for my ND filters. I also appreciate the near silent autofocus and ability to toggle the aperture ring’s click on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLq1Yluk7ecB0fwOcZMF8xXGaYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476004/BFARSACE_042221_4548_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When taking this photo, my Sony A7C’s autofocus system recognized these lenses as a face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 40mm and 50mm lens hoods have filter threads on both the lens and the lens hood for easy mounting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8y8oDQh9l_IsZLwVzcEMrmNUM74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476015/BFARSACE_042221_4548_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When paired with the Sony A7C, these lenses make for a compact package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XEuNc"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are all compact without compromise and at a price that’s high but not out of reach. You can get faster lenses, you can get less expensive lenses, and you can get even smaller lenses. But you will be hard-pressed to find this combination of portability and performance in anything else in Sony’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMkWjH"&gt;I am absolutely welcoming Sony’s big push toward quality cameras and lenses that won’t break my back also. Next stop: compact zooms with faster, constant apertures, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AeH3s9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10473206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NJFcAM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10473214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QLNTPG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10473219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J50MIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxBTCh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated these were Sony G Master lenses. They are Sony G lenses. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxgDh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
