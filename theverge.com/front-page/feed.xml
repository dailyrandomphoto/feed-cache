    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California just made it a lot harder for companies to cover up harassment and abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gov. Gavin Newsom School Visit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWwBOsB4DtGhshUdVYoUxv5duU4=/0x117:4770x3297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967179/1340672342.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/East Bay Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7QrLr"&gt;California governor Gavin Newsom signed the &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331"&gt;Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night— a historic piece of legislation, authored by state senator Connie Leyva (D-Chino), that should protect workers who speak out about harassment and discrimination even if they’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZO2G"&gt;Pinterest whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma began &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;pushing the bill forward last year&lt;/a&gt;, after coming forward with allegations of racism against the tech company. She knew she was partially protected by the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, a Me Too-era law that banned NDAs in sexual harassment cases, but soon realized the bill did not provide protections for other forms of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06SGwv"&gt;Now, that’s changing. Workers in California will be legally protected for speaking out about discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age. &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;You can see the changes in detail here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF7lRv"&gt;The law could have enormous implications for the tech industry, which is famous for having workers sign extremely restrictive NDAs. While it will only protect employees in California, Ozoma has plans to expand it to other parts of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0YG38"&gt;The bill is sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association, Ozoma’s organization Earthseed, and Equal Rights Advocates. It will take effect on January 1st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoOi5Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382148/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act-sb331-discrimination-harassment"&gt;Pinterest agreed to proactively stop making workers sign NDAs&lt;/a&gt; that kept them from discussing “their personal experiences at Pinterest” back in April, after Ozoma’s accusations but months ahead of the law’s passage. Apple, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661536/apple-shareholder-resolution-change-nda-harassment-discrimination"&gt;refused to add language to its employment agreements&lt;/a&gt; to make it clear that employees could discuss workplace harassment and discrimination, after activists and Apple shareholders pressured the company with a shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A friendly reminder that Hulu’s price is going up October 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z084qf1egvn-XPjZF8HqdHS0FA8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966948/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qWATDI"&gt;Hulu’s prices are going up beginning Friday, October 8th for both its monthly and annual subscription tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NoMMc"&gt;It was initially reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Hulu’s monthly cost would increase by $1 per month or $10 per year (ad-supported) to $7 monthly (ad-supported), $13 monthly (no-ads), and $70 per year, respectively. Both Hulu’s base ad-supported and ad-free monthly subscription prices are going up in price by a dollar, but neither of its live TV tiers will be impacted. (Those plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price increase&lt;/a&gt; late last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asUaZ8"&gt;In a recent email to subscribers, Hulu wrote that the price hike “will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 8.” Users will be charged the new price unless they cancel their subscription on or before Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVmgZ5"&gt;Hulu has said that those subscribed through a discount or promotional offer will not be affected by the price increase. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824"&gt;company said&lt;/a&gt; back in September that those who subscribe to Hulu through the Disney Bundle will not be impacted, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKwquY"&gt;While regular price increases have become a to-be-expected inconvenience of the streaming wars, Hulu’s also introduced a handful of changes to its service this year prior to the hike. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599326/hulu-nfl-network-redzone-sports-add-on"&gt;NFL Network and RedZone&lt;/a&gt; were added to Hulu’s live TV service in July, and its live TV service in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412295/hulu-live-tv-service-nickelodeon-comedy-central-mtv-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;additionally added&lt;/a&gt; ViacomCBS-owned channels, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and MTV. Lastly, it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639273/hulu-hdr-original-shows-movies-4k-picture-quality"&gt;announced support&lt;/a&gt; for HDR on some — but not all — of its originals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo engineers suggest Switch Joy-Con drift will never be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmJLD70h9Irl3sz4wrQaErDkwE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966783/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0153.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UoljsC"&gt;One of the Nintendo Switch’s persistent flaws has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;been Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon where players observe false inputs when they aren’t even touching the joysticks on the controllers.  Nintendo has been relatively quiet on the subject for years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;the company refused to say&lt;/a&gt; whether the new OLED-equipped Nintendo Switch OLED had fixed the issue. But today, the company is breaking its silence in a big way — and suggesting that Joy-Con drift may never be fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ENQU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-4/"&gt;In a new Q&amp;amp;A about the development of the Nintendo Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, the company reveals  that it has steadily been making improvements to the Joy-Cons to try and make them more reliable. The joysticks that came with 2019’s Switch Lite aren’t the same as those in the original 2017 Switch, and they’re continually getting refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF8na2"&gt;But Ko Shiota, a Nintendo executive who also serves as GM of Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, basically says that the Joy-Con will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wear down over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pOfAuW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you mean that, basically, wear is unavoidable as long as the parts are physically in contact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtIRq3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shiota:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for example car tires wear out as the car moves, as they are in constant friction with the ground to rotate. So with that same premise, we asked ourselves how we can improve durability, and not only that, but how can both operability and durability coexist? It’s something we are continuously tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wqxr6F"&gt;The joysticks included with the OLED model “are the latest version with all the improvements,” as are the joysticks that ship with the base Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, Joy-Con controllers, and Pro Controllers, the company says. “The analog-stick parts have continuously been improved since launch, and we are still working on improvements,” says deputy general manager Toru Yamashita. When you get your Joy-Cons repaired, Yamashita says they’ll use the latest versions of those sticks for the repairs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOt8WP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;The OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; will be released on Friday, and we’ll have to wait and see if these improvements actually make the Joy-Cons more resilient to drift over time. But it seems that Nintendo never expects to solve Joy-Con drift entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5VILM"&gt;The full interview is long, but worth &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-1/"&gt;reading in full&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s a rare opportunity to hear straight from Nintendo about how it develops hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has promised to actively look into right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzIDdZkF0oeKgvoBHx4ikxbp6jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966690/DSCF1189.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1aWrGd"&gt;Microsoft has agreed to have an independent third-party study the potential impact of it making its devices easier to repair and to make changes based on those findings by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The agreement was made after As You Sow &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/6/24/investors-urge-microsoft-consumers-right-to-repair-electronic-devices"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking Microsoft to look into the potential impact that it could make by making it easier for consumers to get their devices repaired. &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow has withdrawn its resolution&lt;/a&gt; in return for Microsoft conducting the study and making parts and documentation more available to repair shops that aren’t official Microsoft service providers based on the study’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d3xti"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow calls Microsoft’s commitment&lt;/a&gt; “an encouraging step,” but it’s worth keeping in perspective that it is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a step — what Microsoft has actually done today is said that it’ll have a study done and then use it to “guide” its “product design and plans for expanding device repair options,” according to a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by a Microsoft spokesperson. The fact that the company is at least willing to do that is encouraging and is more than other tech giants have done when it comes to right to repair. But without details, it’s hard to say how big of an impact this will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uOprCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft reportedly won’t release the actual study&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIyGEA"&gt;It’s also unclear whether the public will end up getting those details or not. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft will have to post a summary of the study by May 2022, but not the actual study itself (citing concerns over trade secrets). With that said, it should be easy to tell if Microsoft is sticking to its word on this — either it’ll become easier to get your Surface Pro or Xbox repaired at a third-party store, or it won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQHFEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt; also quotes iFixit’s US policy directory, which brings up Microsoft’s lobbying efforts. &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/who-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-right-repair-companies-worth-over-10-trillion"&gt;According to the US Public Interest Research Group&lt;/a&gt; (or US PIRG), Microsoft has been involved in lobbying against right-to-repair laws in Colorado and Washington. If that kind of behavior continues, it would be hard to give Microsoft props for any positive work it does for right to repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LBAxPv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit calls Microsoft’s agreement a “huge, landmark move”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fn3Xcg"&gt;Despite the caveats, right to repair supporters see this agreement as a good thing. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kwiens/status/1446167245965586432"&gt;iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens called it&lt;/a&gt; a “huge, landmark move” on Twitter and, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said that it “wasn’t just talk,” citing the Surface Laptop’s improvements in repairability over the years. PRIG’s right to repair campaign manager also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “the real deal” and cited it as evidence as Microsoft “changing its tune” about right to repair. If it does end up making significant changes, Microsoft could end up ahead of the curve when it comes to reducing its products’ impact on e-waste and emissions — both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; have been working to clamp down on companies illegally making it harder for consumers to get their devices repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBeIuQXMq1BcSbrvCMwxAPosKLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966672/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0062.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H3TdHf"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday that the company is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, where it has been building a new factory for a little more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1oFlw"&gt;Musk said Tesla will continue to operate its electric vehicle factory in Fremont, CA, and that he even plans to try and increase production there by 50 percent. “Just to be clear, though, we will be continuing to expand our activities in California,” he said during the company’s annual shareholder meeting. “So this is not a matter of Tesla leaving California.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7t56j"&gt;The move means Tesla’s home will no longer be the state where its vehicles are the most popular; instead, Tesla will be headquartered in a state &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22457455/tesla-texas-factory-law-ship-out-of-state-direct-sale-legislation"&gt;where it can’t legally sell its cars&lt;/a&gt; directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oB5ISE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is not a matter of Tesla leaving California”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kin2Qr"&gt;Musk had previously threatened to pull Tesla’s entire operations out of California in 2020, because of how vehemently he disagreed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242102/elon-musk-coronavirus-fascist-shelter-in-place-tesla-covid-19-safety-science"&gt;the shelter-in-place orders&lt;/a&gt; the state used to help keep people safe early in the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;sued the county that the company’s California factory is in&lt;/a&gt; as a form of protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48rC05"&gt;Musk himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;moved to Texas&lt;/a&gt; last year, as SpaceX dramatically increased its presence in the southern tip of the state. The Tesla CEO said at one point that he thought California had become too “complacent” with respect to its residents and businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4ORqJ"&gt;Tesla started building its next US Gigafactory outside Austin in 2020 and has made an incredible amount of progress in the intervening year. “We’re going to create an ecological paradise here.. on the Colorado River,” a reference to how the company plans to open up parts of the land it bought to the public. Musk said Thursday that Tesla is also looking at doing more “major installations” of battery storage like the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;one first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ew1FPw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TkfBfx"&gt;Musk previously said that Tesla chose to build in Austin over other locations because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;employees were more willing to move there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31sQhJ"&gt;“There’s a limit to how big you can scale it in the Bay Area,” Musk said Thursday, adding that “it’s tough for people to afford houses [in California].” Tesla’s Austin location is also right near the local airport, which Musk said is convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8pN9K"&gt;Tesla will be moving to Texas at a time when many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;businesses have found themselves under pressure to leave&lt;/a&gt;, after the state recently passed one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country. After the law was passed, Texas’ Governor Greg Abbott used Musk and Tesla as an example to try and prove this was not a trend &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-says-he-prefers-to-stay-out-of-politics-after-texas-governor-cites-his-support-11630627238"&gt;during a CNBC interview&lt;/a&gt;. Abbott said in September that “Elon had to get out of California because, in part, of the social policies in California,” and that Musk “consistently tells me that he likes the social policies in the state of Texas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2zIw2"&gt;Musk responded to that clip in a tweet, saying he “believe[s] government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN0gqH"&gt;“That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbV7ge"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ireland’s status as tax haven for tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Apple is ending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Dublin During COVID-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ecAb1FhBrpAVFNXojRpTl2b_Zbo=/0x37:5890x3964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966603/1233382967.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSVGtj"&gt;Ireland said Thursday it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/59812-ireland-joins-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;would join an international agreement&lt;/a&gt; that sets taxes on profits for multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 percent. This is a major shift for the country that is the European headquarters for many large US pharmaceutical companies, as well as tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QIsgP"&gt;An increase from Ireland’s current 12.5 percent to 15 percent may not seem that large by itself. The so-called Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework agreement, outlined in July, is actually a two-pillar plan aimed at helping end tax avoidance and making international tax rules fairer and more transparent. The OECD has &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/about/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that a 15 percent tax rate would generate some $150 billion in global tax revenue annually and would help to stabilize the international tax system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE36Ic"&gt;Ireland signed on to the deal ahead of a Friday meeting at the OECD among the 140 countries that have been negotiating its terms for several years. The plan calls for global companies to pay taxes in countries where their products or services are sold, even if they don’t have a physical presence there, and would apply to multinational companies with revenues above €750 million (about $867 million). For companies with revenues below €750 million, the 12.5 percent rate would remain in effect in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeFW8"&gt;Over the past several decades, Ireland has served as a tax shelter for many large tech companies, thanks to its low corporate tax rate. Companies typically create Irish subsidiaries of their companies that license their intellectual property, on which the subsidiary pays royalties. Some 800 US companies have operations in Ireland, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.amcham.ie/"&gt;American Chamber of Commerce Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, employing about 180,000 people. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apples-cork-campus-celebrates-40-years-of-community-and-looks-to-the-future/"&gt;Apple opened its first plant in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and now employs some 6,000 people on its campus in the city of Cork. Facebook established its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;international headquarters in Dublin in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;Google opened its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y34ICX"&gt;Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/615f7-statement-by-minister-donohoe-on-decision-for-ireland-join-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that the agreement will “address the tax challenges of digitalisation.” Donohoe added that he believes companies will still choose to locate their headquarters in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KCdt"&gt;“I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will remain an attractive location and ‘best in class’ when multi-nationals look to investment locations,” Donohoe said. “These multinational enterprises support our economy with high value jobs, and at the same time, Ireland provides a stable platform and a long proven track record of success for MNEs choosing to invest here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKurZd"&gt;If the OECD agreement moves forward, its provisions are expected to take effect in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The easy way to install Windows 11 on unsupported CPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5lmPBaowSm6K9tTnlXj3rDhAlk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966581/windows_11_unsupported.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P3lVTM"&gt;Did you take one look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705406/windows-11-upgrade-checklist-cpu-tpm-secure-boot-dual-iso-clean-install"&gt;our hefty Windows 11 upgrade checklist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nope &lt;/em&gt;right out of there? It turns out there’s a &lt;em&gt;dramatically &lt;/em&gt;easier way to install Windows 11 on computers with older CPUs — with no need to reformat your drive, erase your files, or even burn the ISO to an external USB drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDdj2D"&gt;If you’re currently seeing “This PC doesn’t currently meet Windows 11 system requirements” or “The processor isn’t currently supported for Windows 11,” there’s a Microsoft-approved registry hack that should instantly make it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ctV4uU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10795968"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alJDVo"&gt;(We’ve tested this method working on a Dell XPS 15 with Core i7-7700HQ and a Microsoft Surface Go with Pentium Gold 4415Y, neither of which are on Microsoft’s compatibility list.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb9SE8"&gt;Here’s the whole process from start to finish in three easy steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IComo0"&gt;1) Download the Windows 11 ISO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gCQ4Vc"&gt;You’ll need to download the ISO. In our testing, this trick doesn’t work with the Windows 11 Install Assistant, it doesn’t trigger Windows Update, and it doesn’t fool Microsoft’s PC Health Check tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTynku"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindows11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On this Microsoft page&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO).&lt;/strong&gt; Open the &lt;strong&gt;Select Download&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown, pick &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt;, hit the &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; button, select your product language from the &lt;strong&gt;Choose one&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown that appears below, hit &lt;strong&gt;Confirm,&lt;/strong&gt; then click &lt;strong&gt;64-bit Download&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmIZoh"&gt;While that 5.1GB image is downloading, let’s move to step two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aCgc6L"&gt;2) Edit the Windows Registry to bypass the CPU check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="30quIz"&gt;In Windows, hit &lt;strong&gt;Start &lt;/strong&gt;and type &lt;strong&gt;regedit&lt;/strong&gt;, then hit enter to launch the &lt;strong&gt;Registry Editor.&lt;/strong&gt; Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup&lt;/strong&gt;, either by pasting that whole address into &lt;strong&gt;the box just beneath “File, Edit, View, Favorites, Help” &lt;/strong&gt;or by drilling down through the &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MoSetup&lt;/strong&gt; folders one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AI890u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10795972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pG5L5V"&gt;In the right pane, right-click and pick &lt;strong&gt;New &amp;gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value&lt;/strong&gt;. Name the value “&lt;strong&gt;AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU” &lt;/strong&gt;minus the quotes. Double-click on the new value you created, and enter &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; into the &lt;strong&gt;Value data&lt;/strong&gt; field. Hit &lt;strong&gt;OK &lt;/strong&gt;and close the registry editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QnycYq"&gt;3) Open the ISO in Windows Explorer and launch setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bKCbJB"&gt;Did the ISO finish downloading? Just right-click on it and pick &lt;strong&gt;Open with &amp;gt; Windows Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; to mount the virtual disc, then double-click the &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt; file to begin installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tK50o"&gt;That’s it! If the registry hack worked, you should soon see a warning message instead of a rejection message, and be given the option to install Windows 11 without losing your data.  Just know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686457/windows-11-health-check-compatible-supported-cpu-old-pc-waiver"&gt;Microsoft reserves the right to withhold security updates if you go this route&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s address bar has ads now, but you can disable them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVsPZjUBMkwtqnWB8_6a58ooxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966530/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2wVhKH"&gt;Mozilla introduced a new suggested search result feature in the Firefox address bar as part of &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/93.0/releasenotes/"&gt;the 93.0 release of its browser&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not too surprising — Firefox Suggest, Mozilla’s feature for “surfacing relevant information and sites to help you accomplish your goals,” is similar to suggestions offered by most browsers. But &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/760177/firefox-is-getting-ads-in-your-search-bar/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/navigate-web-faster-firefox-suggest"&gt;support pages&lt;/a&gt;, it also includes content from paid advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ7aRO"&gt;“When contextual suggestions are enabled, Firefox Suggest uses your city location and search keywords to make contextual suggestions from Firefox and our partners, while keeping your privacy in mind,” the support post reads. The “relevant suggestions” from “trusted partners” appear at the bottom of the usual search suggestions pulled from your bookmarks, browser history, and open tabs — a less intrusive version of a search ad, but technically still an ad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LMLqyxH6XNvqY-eyLAadFir_0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908519/firefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see results from partners at the bottom of Firefox Suggest results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEbSXp"&gt;According to the support page, Firefox Suggest doesn’t require any new data to be “collected, stored, or shared to make these new recommendations,” and the company only works with partners that meet Mozilla’s privacy standards for Firefox. The feature has also been kicking around since at least the previous 92.0 release, even though it first appeared in the current version’s release notes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MMB838Qir7f6MI97-bM_dtVi94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908730/disablefirefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can disable Firefox Suggest in settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iEmzP2"&gt;After updating to the newest version of the browser, Firefox might present you with a pop-up asking if you want to enable “contextual suggestions” or adjust your settings. If you accidentally enabled any of the  Firefox Suggest features without realizing it, you can still disable them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tHNYnV"&gt;Click on the hamburger menu and then select Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EZLxFD"&gt;Click on Privacy and Security in the sidebar and scroll to Address Bar — Firefox Suggest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G8ADPT"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for contextual suggestions to turn the feature on or off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RFAhFN"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for “occasional sponsored suggestions”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yuO8AK"&gt;It’s slightly disappointing to have to manage a feature like this. Firefox is a popular alternative to browsers like Google Chrome because it’s stricter with users’ privacy and generally less data-hungry. If you trust Mozilla and want to support it, Firefox Suggest might not be a huge bother. It’s also not the first time the company has dabbled in advertising — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17326184/firefox-ads-sponsored-content-pocket-suggestions"&gt;Mozilla incorporated paid advertiser links&lt;/a&gt; and Pocket article reading suggestions in new tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a4ffpk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Firefox gets a redesign with bigger, floatier tabs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463321/firefox-design-redesign-bigger-floatier-tabs"},{"title":"Mozilla and Google renew Firefox search agreement ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wxFDUY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s browser is now available for its Wear OS smartwatches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vceeJObRzlEBHUmcTc9T0oe_EVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966520/dbohn_210816_4717_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s latest smartwatches.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N0i2wd"&gt;Samsung has brought its Samsung Internet web browser to the new Wear OS-based Galaxy Watch 4 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Browsing on a watch doesn’t sound like my ideal way to surf the web for a long period of time, but I could see how it could be useful for small tasks like checking a name or looking up a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztCSdZ"&gt;I don’t have a Galaxy Watch 4, so I can’t give you hands-on experience of how the Samsung Internet browser works. But based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; testing&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung has thought of some neat tricks to make it possible to navigate the web on your wrist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XBhlGR"&gt;An obvious question about a web browser on your wrist is how exactly that tiny, circular display can manage to show full webpages. Samsung’s answer is with gestures. A guide will come up when you navigate to your first webpage that explains a diagonal swipe from either side of the screen will allow users to get to the corners of a webpage. Meanwhile, a swipe up reveals options for bookmarks, “Zoom mode,” and a shortcut to send the webpage directly to your connected phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="meVthU"&gt;This new browser only adds to what you can already get with the Galaxy Watch 4 series of smartwatches, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;which we thought were pretty good&lt;/a&gt; — as long as you’re already using a Samsung phone, that is. It should be noted that a browser on a smartwatch isn’t new, though; Samsung also has a browser for its &lt;a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/geardetail/com.samsung.wbrowser?langCd=en"&gt;Tizen-based smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Apple Watch has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17841742/apple-watch-update-new-features-os-5-release-date"&gt;built-in browsing capabilities&lt;/a&gt; (though there’s no dedicated Apple Watch version of Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
