    <title>Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account? It’s complicated</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iy8sJn"&gt;Facebook (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;now called Meta&lt;/a&gt;) knows a lot of virtual reality headset owners hate logging in with Facebook. Requiring Facebook logins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;created bad blood&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518194/oculus-quest-2-headset-facebook-account-suspension-problems"&gt;accidentally locked some people&lt;/a&gt; out of their Quest VR hardware in late 2020. And at today’s Connect keynote, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hinted the restriction might be ending. But his comments raised more questions than they answered, and we still don’t know exactly what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVWZt8"&gt;Zuckerberg mentioned the changes while talking about work applications for VR. Here’s what he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kbghFn"&gt;“As we’ve focused more on work, and frankly as we’ve heard your feedback more broadly, we’re working on making it so you can log into Quest with an account other than your personal Facebook account. We’re starting to test support for Work Accounts soon, and we’re working on making a broader shift here within the next year. I know this is a big deal for a lot of people. Not everyone wants their social media profile linked to all these other experiences, and I get that, especially as the metaverse expands. And I’ll share more about that later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8QzwqP"&gt;Oculus Quest headsets — which will soon be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;known as Meta Quest headsets&lt;/a&gt; — have required a Facebook account since 2020. (Until the Quest 2’s release that year, users could choose to log in with either Facebook or a separate Oculus-branded account.) Some information gets shared across the services, and you’ll see Facebook social options in VR, although you can maintain separate user profiles and friends lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxGptO"&gt;This choice was so controversial that it apparently helped inspire Meta’s rebranding. Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stratechery’s&lt;/em&gt; Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt; that the backlash added a sense of “urgency” to get Facebook’s name off the company as a whole. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also noted the issue after Connect. “As we’ve heard feedback from the VR community more broadly, we’re working on new ways to log into Quest that won’t require a Facebook account, landing sometime next year. This is one of our highest priority areas of work internally,” Bosworth &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491"&gt;wrote in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQRKzz"&gt;But there’s a wide spectrum of possible changes that Meta could make, and only some of them would address critics’ underlying complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ1hck"&gt;Facebook has so far committed to one limited change: if you use the enterprise-oriented Quest for Business program, which will begin testing in the coming months, you’ll be able to sign in with Facebook’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-products-for-the-next-era-of-personalized-experiences"&gt;Work Accounts&lt;/a&gt; system. Businesses had a similar option under the earlier Oculus for Business program, so this is more of a feature reshuffling than a practical advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoIRiq"&gt;Zuckerberg and Bosworth suggest that’s not the only change we’ll see, but Facebook is being cagey about the details. When I directly asked if users will be able to log into Quest headsets (or the Horizon “metaverse” platform) using something besides a personal Facebook account &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a Facebook Work Account, a spokesperson only reiterated Zuckerberg’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMK3wC"&gt;Facebook’s “broader shift” could involve little more than renaming “Facebook accounts” to “Meta accounts” or “Horizon accounts.” And any version of it will probably ask you to hand some data to Facebook. But a more meaningful change could address a few major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tIUzzF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Initial setup requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; Zuckerberg committed during Connect to letting you sideload VR apps from outside Meta’s official store, but you currently can’t reach that point without a Facebook-based initialization process. While it doesn’t seem incredibly likely, Meta &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; introduce a bare-bones setup that offers basic headset features without creating any kind of account — so you could sideload media the way you would on a laptop or other electronic device, bypassing the online Meta/Facebook ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1SysyX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Logins for schools, festivals, and other non-business organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; Lots of schools, film festivals, and other organizations use VR headsets. Typical business accounts won’t necessarily provide the best fit, and neither would personal accounts of any type — even if they’re not specifically &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; personal accounts. Facebook has acknowledged and promoted all these use cases, so Meta is probably at least thinking about this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T5AUvH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Public-facing profiles and “real” names. &lt;/strong&gt;Joining Facebook means creating a profile that makes your “real” legal name (along with some limited profile data) accessible to anybody else on Facebook. Even if you provide a credit card with your name for internal app purchases, any meaningful login change should let you create a Meta account that nobody else can look up, and like non-Facebook Oculus profiles, it shouldn’t use your legal name as your default username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yfTV9W"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data partitioning.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you log into Facebook and your Quest with different accounts, the same company owns both of them. Facebook has long reserved the right to cross-check different accounts against each other so it can ban spammers or stalkers from multiple services at once. But Meta should let you explicitly silo the data in each account — so there’s no risk of your Facebook News Feed engagement generating recommendations on the Quest store, for instance, or of Facebook revealing a pseudonymous VR friend’s identity by recommending that you follow their Facebook account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vXVdGM"&gt;Meta is clearly aware of the critiques of its account policies. But based on executives’ statements so far, it could be months until we hear more about its plans for addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google makes waitlists for Pixel 6 Pro because it can’t keep the phone in stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N6bqlBERQlzi3p1lX5C5XSGEYE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059916/akrales_211020_4802_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vu0U7S"&gt;After what seems like an eternity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;teases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;reveals&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are finally on sale. But Google seems to be running very low on inventory, as the company now offers waitlists so you can be notified of when the phone will be available again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuUcic"&gt;Right at the top of the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro page on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a now banner advertising the waitlist. “Due to high demand, some Pixel 6 Pro models may be out of stock or have long delivery times,” the company says. “Get notified when they’re back in stock, or check out other authorized retailers who may have them available.” The banner includes buttons to join the waitlist and see other retailers where you can try to get the phone instead. After clicking the buy button &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US"&gt;on the Pixel 6 Pro page&lt;/a&gt;, I was also able to join waitlists for both the unlocked black and gold models with 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoMBUdv7THhA_4U2-6-W4hwsojw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964727/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_2.42.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s notice about Pixel 6 Pro inventory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ECLapc"&gt;That said, the Google Store’s stock doesn’t seem to be entirely depleted. While writing this article, I saw unlocked models of all three colors come in stock a few times (though I sometimes wasn’t fast enough to check what storage you could pick from). The Google Fi version of the 128GB black model was available at one point. If you’re a Verizon customer, it appears you can still pick from many Pixel 6 Pro color and storage options. (I am not a Verizon subscriber, so I can’t take one of those models all the way to my cart to confirm if it’s actually available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbAi0N"&gt;We asked Google about the fluctuating stock situation. “The banner on the Pro page on the Google Store is still accurate — some models of the Pro are out of stock,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While we work to make more available, customers can check out our authorized partners nationwide while supplies last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtJxoX"&gt;This is all to say that it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to get a Pixel 6 Pro from the Google Store if you really want one. If you’re striking out at Google’s store, you might want to see if they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; — otherwise, you can always join Google’s waitlists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an incredible life-size Ghostbusters Proton Pack prop you can actually buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXwEZngORwL6ayTwOWrgd1vtu98=/153x0:2403x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059907/ghostbusters_haslab.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a hook for the wand, but it’s sold separately.&lt;/em&gt; | Hasbro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNX4Vd"&gt;You’ve always wanted your very own &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; Proton Pack. Your options have been: find a cheap toy, 3D print, sand and paint your own, pay for someone to do it for you, start with a premade kit, or painstakingly build something even more intricate from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHUXr0"&gt;Here’s a sixth way that might be the easiest and most cost-effective yet: pay Hasbro $400 for &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/haslab/products/ghostbusters-plasma-series-spengler-s-proton-pack"&gt;this incredible-looking thing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6YbLscPNzrDS3rtVa_x5USAEfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964766/F5226_PROD_GHB_Tango_02698_1500x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pack at an angle, covered in lovely shiny bits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwSNTUXk88VUy13mgaGAMPEP3F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964800/F5226_PROD_GHB_Tango_02744_original_1500x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical shoulder and belt straps plus what looks like a lumbar pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Iu8V"&gt;Hasbro says the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Pack is based on 3D scans of the actual movie prop from &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s complete with lights, sounds (from both 1984 and 2021), a cyclotron you can open up and dismantle, a full set of straps so you can wear it, and apparently an incredible amount of fantastic weathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVVTML"&gt;I reached out to my &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;-loving friend for context, who’s been trying to build his own for years, and he was impressed by the price, pointing out that &lt;a href="https://macksfactory.myshopify.com/products/pp101-proton-pack-body-kit"&gt;you can easily pay $400&lt;/a&gt; just for a competent body kit to help you build your own, let alone a finished product with this level of detail, and the cost of &lt;a href="https://www.gbfans.com/shop/pack-parts/"&gt;all the bits you’d need for the full effect&lt;/a&gt; can add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cvxpMDVfbcrMdUcY63SqWhftJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964793/249554929_1347662312303167_1222699879126391046_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I hear &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://macksfactory.myshopify.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mack’s Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a popular parts destination for Proton Pack builders.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTuSE"&gt;Still, if you buy Hasbro’s version, you’ll have the same one as everybody else who does, and some take pride in building their own, just like there’s a community of fans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3759042/star-wars-han-solo-blaster-prop-replica"&gt;reaching for the perfect replica of Han Solo’s DL-44 blaster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"&gt;the perfect Star Wars lightsaber&lt;/a&gt;. And you’ll still need to figure out how to add a plasma wand: &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/ghostbusters-plasma-series-spengler-s-neutrona-wand-premium-collectible?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlOmLBhCHARIsAGiJg7nTTFRQ1knVHhb6SGsGg-wF-P-dLkwbKOR8tU4aHY2NHSrxjuGZ_BkaArn2EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;kid=39700059628823809"&gt;Hasbro’s $125 version&lt;/a&gt; is sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VEloHJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The greatest Star Wars lightsabers in the world are built by fans","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"},{"title":"The neverending quest for a perfect Han Solo DL-44 blaster replica","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3759042/star-wars-han-solo-blaster-prop-replica"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qWqcIk"&gt;It also could be quite a wait: this crowdfunded toy / prop isn’t scheduled to ship till spring 2023. You’ve got until December 12th of this year to decide if you’re in — with these HasLab products, the company is only promising a single production run. I still wonder if I made the right choice skipping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535512/the-mandalorian-star-wars-hasbro-toy-ship-razor-crest-baby-yoda"&gt;the amazing $350 &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; Razor Crest&lt;/a&gt;, though the Lego version’s not bad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid the fluff, Meta showed an impressive demo of its Codec Avatars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zg_6gUA42IKcFk_sncD9d_x_Pw=/240x0:2640x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059609/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.12.29.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wyJE3"&gt;Meta, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;formerly known as Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, held a presentation today where it announced its rebranding and showed off what it imagines the future of computing will look like — but amid all the fluff, it actually had some interesting tech demos. The first showed off its life-like Codex avatars and an environment for them to exist in, which the company says was rendered in real-time and reacted to real-world objects. Mark Zuckerberg also talked about the company’s work with neural interfaces that let you control a computer just by moving your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ln7TUX"&gt;We’ll discuss the demos in just a moment, but it’s really worth seeing them for yourself. You can check them out &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookrealitylabs/videos/561535698440683/?t=10291"&gt;on the Facebook keynote archive&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XOn2CZWnxxY?t=3684"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ YouTube stream&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer that interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i93fk9rsraSFKk5yWTgUBD0DPqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964553/avatar_demo.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Meta, this is both a virtual avatar and a virtual environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="eyT9zo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5O2K2"&gt;During the presentation, Meta showed off the work it’s been doing on &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/codec-avatars-facebook-reality-labs/"&gt;its Codec Avatars&lt;/a&gt; to give users better control over their eyes, facial expressions, hairstyles, and appearance. The company also showed off the ability to simulate how the avatar’s hair and skin could react to different lighting conditions and environments and even how it was working on interactive clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D0SUW"&gt;The presenter made it very clear that this tech is “still very definitely research,” and it’s no wonder — there’s an immense amount of hardware required to make one of the avatars, and Meta’s likely using very high-powered computers to render it. But it’s at least exciting to see that Meta’s goal is to let us render ourselves with graphics equivalent to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;cutting-edge video game engines are capable of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Meta, this was rendered in real-time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KDb1Bq"&gt;The company also showed off its real-time environment rendering, which it said would eventually be a place for you to use your avatar to interact with others. The system also lets people interact with real-life objects, with the changes being reflected in the virtual world. While realistic environments are nothing new, being able to make changes to them in the real world and see those changes happen in a virtual one makes for a really cool demo (even if the tracking points added to the real-life objects are a bit distracting in how much they stand out). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta’s “illustration” of what the neural interface might do in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wpi9St"&gt;As for the neural interface, Meta’s relying on something called electromyography, or EMG, to turn the signals your brain is sending to your hand into computer commands. It showed off the wristband it uses to do this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and the demo Meta gave today didn’t really show off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433516/ctrl-labs-brain-computer-interface-armband-hands-on-preview"&gt;anything that wasn’t around&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 when it bought a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;called CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt; and acquired its tech, but it’s still good to see that it’s being worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/itkAbEFFcrmHvNSVkGFbPc0shgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964236/FB_Research_EMG.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The actual prototype Meta researchers are using.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cfARZQ"&gt;Meta has said that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577095/facebook-bci-ucsf-chang-lab-brain-typing-research-update-project-steno-ar-vr"&gt;pursuing EMG input instead of brain-reading devices&lt;/a&gt;, so it may have been showing off the way you interact with its future devices. Compared to visions of people playing VR ping-pong for an audience of avatars, this felt like the most realistic thing Meta showed off Thursday. That doesn’t mean the Oculus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;er, Meta, apparently&lt;/a&gt;) Quest 3 will come with an EMG wristband, but in a sea of hype without much substance, its demo and the other actual research Meta showed off was a sight for sore eyes. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XOn2CZWnxxY?t=3684"&gt;Check them out&lt;/a&gt; if you’re looking for a break from the rest of the Facebook / Meta news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lost $6 billion to chip shortage and manufacturing delays in Q4, Tim Cook says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rva65arZ-PiIObusakoSD4ivn0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059433/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bP2687"&gt;Apple today posted strong earnings for its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/"&gt;fourth fiscal 2021 quarter&lt;/a&gt;, reporting all-time highs for its services and Mac divisions. The company says it took in revenue of $83.4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 29 percent, and earnings per share of $1.24. That earnings number came in below Wall Street expectations of $84.85 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbzuCz"&gt;CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that supply chain constraints had a clear impact on financial results this quarter. “We had a very strong performance despite larger than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion,” Cook said, attributing the supply issues to “the industry-wide chip shortages that have been talked about a lot and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia.” Apple expects an even greater loss from supply chain issues in the December quarter, it said during Thursday’s earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKp8XU"&gt;The company is fresh off the launch of several new products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad mini&lt;/a&gt;, ninth-gen iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the eagerly anticipated MacBook Pro powered by Apple silicon. The latest iPhones weren’t released until late in the quarter, but the iPhone business as a whole continued to show strong momentum and was up 47 percent over a year ago. The iPad was also up 21 percent over the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQpqjy"&gt;Like other large tech companies, and as Cook made clear, Apple is dealing with major supply chain challenges: the high-end iPhones remain difficult to find in stock at Apple retail locations, and its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are already severely backordered. If you don’t want to deal with long shipping delays, the best option is routinely checking stock at local Apple stores. But even that’s not a guaranteed strategy, and the reality is that buying Apple’s latest gadgets is more difficult than in years past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will spend ‘several billion dollars’ to avoid holiday shipping delays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZirqdNAJqgGhcK5BdVqB8LM4n8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059292/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RLrVw2"&gt;Amazon wants to avoid holiday shipping delays as much as you do. The company said today that it plans to spend “several billion dollars” to avoid problems during the holidays, which might extend from product delivery issues to keeping items in stock. The money will be spent on increased pay for workers, heightened shipping costs, and mitigating supply chain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0c78q"&gt;“It’ll be expensive for us in the short term, but it’s the right prioritization for our customers and partners,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said today in &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx"&gt;the company’s third-quarter earnings release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47njQg"&gt;The big spending comes as both a promise and a warning. Amazon’s earnings disappointed investors with a significant dip in quarterly profits from last year. That’s largely due to increased spending across the board — the company spent $3.8 billion more on fulfillment, $3.3 billion more on tech costs, and $2.6 billion more on marketing, to name just a few expenses — which ate into the quarter’s $110.8 billion in revenue, which was up 15 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZuS5f"&gt;Jassy, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;only installed as CEO on July 5th&lt;/a&gt;, said that these expenses were necessary to deliver good service to customers. “We’ve always said that when confronted with the choice between optimizing for short-term profits versus what’s best for customers over the long term, we will choose the latter,” he said. Jassy called the expenses, “extraordinary investments across our businesses to satisfy customer needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Connect: all the news about ‘Meta’ and Mark Zuckerberg’s VR dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ThF0I2iExmwWX6ywgrznTY31JU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059231/DSCF7685.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company unveiled a new name and vision for the future in its keynote&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="IWw8JJ"&gt;Facebook held its virtual reality labs Connect event on Thursday, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;announced that the company would be rebranding as Meta&lt;/a&gt; and showed off his vision of a metaverse that inspired the name change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNJ6yX"&gt;During the prerecorded livestream, we saw the company’s plans for Oculus VR, which included a tease for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749008/facebook-oculus-project-cambria-pro-vr-ar-headset"&gt;a new high-end headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750569/facebook-oculus-horizon-home-social-vr-space-connect"&gt;addition of a more customizable home space&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749648/active-pack-oculus-quest-2-fitness-workouts-sweat-hygiene"&gt;fitness-focused accessories&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751009/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-oculus-quest-2"&gt;VR remake of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We also got to see a lot of videos that involved virtual avatars going to concerts, playing ping-pong, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYvik1"&gt;Since the stream ended, more details have come out about the company’s rebranding, including that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;the Oculus name would be replaced&lt;/a&gt; and that the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751143/facebook-thumbs-up-like-meta-sign-global-headquarters-replaced"&gt;changed its office’s iconic sign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reporter Alex Heath &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;interviewed Zuckerberg to talk about the motivation behind the name change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrS0BR"&gt;There’s sure to be more information coming about Facebook’s rebranding and its potential ramifications, so stay tuned here for all the latest news about Meta. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Biden plan would give e-bike buyers up to $1,500 in tax credits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-Bikes Increasing In Popularity" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-fLvv0zzlMj6-ui9B29teBXEu4=/0x9:3500x2342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059128/1236048159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Erin Clark/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dXIK5"&gt;There’s good news in the latest version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;White House budget deal&lt;/a&gt;: the proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22590792/ebike-act-senate-brian-schatz-tax-credit-infrastructure"&gt;federal tax credit for new electric bike purchases&lt;/a&gt; has survived the most recent round of Congressional bloodletting. Not only that, but it’s been restored to its former glory of 30 percent, after the &lt;a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2021/09/16/e-bike-tax-credit-bill-cut-half-half-ways-and-means-committee#.YXsGy9bMJAc"&gt;House of Representatives slashed it to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEv4Ht"&gt;Still, it’s a hugely important proposal for a product that is still struggling to reach mass adoption. If the deal passes in its current form, e-bikes would become significantly cheaper for most Americans. In turn, that could mean a significant change in the transportation options for millions of people around the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdfCWs"&gt;The legislation would offer Americans a refundable tax credit worth 30 percent of a new e-bike’s purchase price, capped at $1,500. All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, but bikes with motors more powerful than 750W would not. The credit would be fully refundable, which would allow lower-income individuals to claim it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QaIuAA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are some caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Olv3l"&gt;Bikes that cost more than $5,000 would not be eligible. The program is also means-tested, meaning the credit would begin phasing out $200 for every $1,000 spent on the purchase for individuals who earn $75,000, heads of household earning $112,500, and married couples who file jointly earning $150,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhdjJb"&gt;E-bikes are significantly more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, which could help make real progress in the fight against climate change. A recent study found that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a33798099/e-bikes-can-reduce-carbon-emissions-study/#:~:text=Take%20an%20E%2DBike%20to,emissions%20would%20drop%2012%20percent.&amp;amp;text=Research%20from%20a%20recent%20study,reducing%20carbon%20emissions%20in%20cities."&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZDPfY"&gt;There are other benefits for cyclists tucked away in the massive 1,600-page bill. People who ride bikes to work or use bike-share would be eligible for pre-tax commuter benefits similar to those who drive and park or take public transportation to work. Under the proposal, employees would be allowed to receive a bicycle benefit of up to 30 percent of the parking benefit — currently equivalent to $81 a month, less than $1,000 a year, for bicycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9t5ob"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Facebook’s change to Meta, what’s the new Big Tech acronym?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9m23TA9Rjqnnfnn8HXJMjsuHS1E=/168x0:1992x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059041/248542531_922091671726906_154548412751156736_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collage of Meta logos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ARsuiR"&gt;The company formerly known as Facebook just revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;its new name, Meta&lt;/a&gt;. And while that change brings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;a whole lot of questions&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one that many of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been pondering for about 30 minutes: how does the Meta name change the acronym used to refer to the biggest tech companies in one fell swoop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muOa6m"&gt;Before Thursday, FAANG — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google — was perhaps the most commonly used one. But that acronym already doesn’t quite work. Google is technically a part of Alphabet now, so there should be a third A. (FAAAN?) It’s missing Microsoft, which is just as mind-bogglingly huge as some of the other companies. And you could argue that Tesla should be part of the acronym conversation, especially now that its market cap has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;surpassed $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ds1En2"&gt;Now that we all have to start saying Meta, we’ve put together a list of some potential Big Tech acronyms we could use instead. And before we dive in, here are the letters we’re playing with: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;pple, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;mazon, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;lphabet or &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;oogle, &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;eta, &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;icrosoft, &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;etflix, and &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;esla. In short: A, A, A / G, M, M, N, T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AV6xym"&gt;GAMMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QGUJcw"&gt;MAGMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zxg15f"&gt;MAMAA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRkQkc"&gt;MAAAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2yad3e"&gt;MMAAGT (pronounced “maggot”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TV7ff2"&gt;GAMAT (Used in a sentence: “We’re running the GAMAT of options here.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wc7IgD"&gt;MATMAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MdcABL"&gt;MGMT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="An7eWR"&gt;MANAGMT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U3t99B"&gt;MANTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yae9FB"&gt;A MANTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U94cZU"&gt;ANTMAN (Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nicrosoft [it works, okay, don’t question it])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YQXBGV"&gt;Or perhaps we’ll just keep saying Facebook and Google, swap in Microsoft for Netflix, and say FAAMG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iP4zdV"&gt;What are your ideas? Post them in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox clarifies that a native Apple Silicon app is coming in 2022 after forum outrage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5FJSImoVKSscJ0gK7033q8W0Nkk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058892/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Pdh3z"&gt;Dropbox will finally be updating its Mac app to natively support Apple Silicon sometime in the first half of 2022, the company confirmed today. A previous forum thread saw Dropbox staffers claim that a native app would require “a bit more support before we share your suggestion with our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAXIF"&gt;The months-old thread was resurfaced in a post by developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1453394500848537605?s=20"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/dropbox-no-plans-to-support-apple-silicon/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), sparking complaints from Dropbox users who were disappointed by the impression that the company would only develop the app if enough customers asked for it. While Dropbox technically does work with Apple Silicon hardware thanks to Apple’s Rosetta 2 software translation layer, it’s not as power or memory efficient as it could be if it ran natively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27WhBd"&gt;In response to the confusion, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO Drew Houston&lt;/a&gt; clarified that the service is “certainly supporting Apple Silicon” and that it’s been “working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022.” Houston also apologized for the support thread responses, which he called “not ideal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1zbF00"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're certainly supporting Apple Silicon, sorry for the confusion. We've been working for a while on a native M1 build which we aim to release in H1 2022. (And agree the responses in the support thread were not ideal)&lt;/p&gt;— Drew Houston (@drewhouston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bodyDisplay_9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-ideas/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/idc-p/553669/highlight/true#M64135"&gt;support thread&lt;/a&gt; has also since been resolved with a similar update clarifying the current development of a native M1 app and apologizing for the confusion. “While we regularly ask for customer feedback and input on new products or features, this should not have been one of those instances.” &lt;/p&gt;
