    <title>Google announces $99 Pixel Buds A-Series</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DH2sGY"&gt;As usual for Google hardware, the new Pixel Buds A-Series have already been extensively leaked, and the company even tweeted about them prematurely. But today, the earbuds are being officially announced. They’re priced at $99, a significant savings compared to the $179 standard Pixel Buds, and are available for preorder in the United States and Canada starting now. Google says the Pixel Buds A-Series be released on June 17th. They come in either olive green or white and gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPKJBX"&gt;Despite their much lower cost, the Pixel Buds A-Series retain the same sound quality as the 2020 Pixel Buds. They also still offer hands-free “Hey Google” voice commands and are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Google has slashed some features of the prior earbuds — like wireless charging for the case and swipe controls for volume — but the Pixel Buds A-Series don’t skimp on much else. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4yuWVO"&gt;Battery life is rated at five hours (24 hours counting recharges in the case), and Google says you can get up to three hours of listening time with a 15-minute quick charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LH0ar9"&gt;While the Pixel Buds A-Series look practically identical to the regular Pixel Buds, Google has tweaked the design by softening the integrated ear hooks / stabilizer arcs and making them a bit smaller. The company has also taken steps to avoid the connectivity bugs and audio cutouts that still affect some owners of its last earbuds. And the Pixel Buds A-Series can crank louder in overall volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1VZV1"&gt;Did Google succeed in making a must-have pair of $99 earbuds? Well, I’ve actually been using the Pixel Buds A-Series for a few days now, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229692"&gt;you can read the full review&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel Buds A-Series review: price is everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The $99 Pixel Buds are a better buy than their pricier predecessors&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MBwNxA"&gt;With the new, awkwardly named Pixel Buds A-Series, Google is trying to do more than merely introduce a much cheaper set of true wireless earbuds: the company wants to get it right this time — and get it right for under $100. Google’s second-generation Pixel Buds were certainly an improvement over the company’s original wireless earbuds; let us never forget &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16659314/google-pixel-buds-review-bluetooth-headphones"&gt;the most overly intricate carrying case of all time&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;the 2020 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; came with issues of their own. At the top of that list were concerns with stability. Google never managed to get the two Pixel Buds connected as reliably as many competitors, and some owners still complain of audio dropouts even after numerous firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fzvcX"&gt;In several ways, Google has succeeded at its goal. The $99 Pixel Buds A-Series are more comfortable to wear over longer stretches of time than the pricier earbuds. They retain the same enjoyable sound quality, and hands-free “Hey Google” access to Google Assistant and features like real-time language translation are still useful tricks to have at your disposal. The carrying case is just as fun to fidget with as before (though it lost wireless charging) and has the same satisfying thunk when you close it. Google promises the same five hours of continuous battery life, with a total of 24 hours when you include case recharges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKSngV"&gt;The bad news is that Google didn’t fully overcome the connectivity issues, though it made some improvement. I recently talked with Google’s Sandeep Waraich, who went over some of the changes made to the A-Series buds that were meant to enhance wireless reliability. Each earbud connects individually to the source device. Both the antenna and chipset architectures were optimized for stronger transmission power and increased range to avoid cross-body audio dropouts. There’s even an all-new chipset inside, though Google declined to tell me who manufactures it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N02isN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10531346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EhyAYZ"&gt;But in my experience so far, the Pixel Buds A-Series still have more occasional blips and audio interruptions than those from many competitors. It’s not as much of a glaring problem as before, and I really only encountered it on the move (and on busy streets with plenty of wireless interference), but it’s still something you’ll run into at times. But I find that it’s easier to tolerate things like this for $99 than the $179 that Google still asks for the 2020 Pixel Buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUjrBu"&gt;Google also told me about some subtle improvements it made to the physical design. The A-Series earbuds look nearly identical to the 2020 Pixel Buds, but according to Waraich, the nonremovable “stabilizer arc” — a source of discomfort last time after prolonged listening — has been made softer and smaller than before. I’ve got large ears, and it seems like the hook never settles into the folds of my ear the way it’s meant to, but the Pixel Buds A-Series sit snug and stable regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-mqRAbZIEGmwTya0612daUqEMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555558/cwelch_20210528_4608_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series look just like the regular Pixel Buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gODBJp"&gt;Google also shaved off a few milligrams of weight from each earbud. The Pixel Buds A-Series come in either white or olive green, and the inside of the carrying case is now color matched to whichever earbuds you get. In the ear, the Pixel Buds continue to have a very discreet, flush style and can be hard to spot when looking at someone head-on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Et7hgK_0Sa-H76MD0t84D6oWk3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556165/DSCF4053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They still have a discreet design that sits flush against your ear and doesn’t stick out far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8GGsB2"&gt;The acoustic architecture is unchanged, so the sound signature between the Pixel Buds and Pixel Buds A-Series is very consistent. That’s a good thing. Google aims for full, natural audio reproduction, and that’s what you get from these earbuds and their 12-millimeter drivers. You can still enable the “bass boost” option in settings to give the low end some added oomph. Even with bass boost active, the Pixel Buds don’t match the boominess of something like the Jabra Elite 75ts or Sony’s WF-XB700s. Still, there’s a level of clarity that outshines many earbuds that sell at the $100 mark. Waraich told me that Google increased overall volume levels across the board after some customers found the 2020 Pixel Buds couldn’t crank as high as they’d hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmxE4K223PuPFL17vC4WAICDJNw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555553/cwelch_20210525_4608_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The carrying case is also similar, though this one lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8E6mFU"&gt;But although the Pixel Buds A-Series can get louder, they still have to contend with a lot of the outside world. Like the previous model, these A-Series earbuds just aren’t very good at noise isolation. While working from the outdoor seating area at my local coffee shop, I could hear an annoying level of traffic at all times. I think it partially comes down to their vented, airy design, but Google seems to struggle with this more than other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_xoHKFR7xJj3CktlP7Zz9ztFFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555560/cwelch_20210528_4608_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use hands-free voice commands by saying “Hey Google.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z3CWAnAE-vIe0slq75QDJnkshnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555559/cwelch_20210528_4608_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series can easily connect to Android phones with Fast Pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n6JQ3B"&gt;Google says it actually tweaked the spatial vents to allow &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; outside noise in, but it’s still a noticeable downside of these earbuds. I think it’s inherently got something to do with the fit and “gentle” in-ear seal that Google had in mind with the design. What’s become clear to me is that the next flagship Pixel Buds really need some form of active noise cancellation to counteract this. I know there are people who prefer some awareness of what’s happening around them, but you get a little too much of that with the Pixel Buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7J2UyK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10531483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3Tklq"&gt;I already mentioned the loss of wireless charging, but other sacrifices that Google made to hit the $99 price aren’t as obvious. The swipe forward / back gestures that let you easily control volume on the Pixel Buds are gone; now you’re limited to just taps for track controls. The A-Series earbuds also ditch the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9642883?hl=en#:~:text=Attention%20Alerts%20is%20an%20experimental%20feature%20on%20Pixel,baby%20crying%2C%20dog%20barking%2C%20and%20emergency%20vehicle%20siren."&gt;“experimental” attention alerts feature&lt;/a&gt; that could detect specific sounds like sirens, dog barks, or a baby crying. And the LED that was on the &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the Pixel Buds case (to indicate charge status of the buds) is also history. These omissions make sense to me, and Google has at least preserved other important vitals like IPX4 water and sweat resistance. Voice calls also remain a Pixel Buds strength on the A-Series, with dual beamforming mics that do a good job of plucking your voice out of noisy environments and maintaining clarity during phone chats or work conference calls. Voice commands to Google Assistant were also recognized loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdlwQctHOnP35unxIC27xUpcuM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555555/cwelch_20210528_4608_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc1thk"&gt;The “adaptive sound” feature, which automatically adjusts volume based on your surroundings, is also carried over from the 2020 Pixel Buds. It works reasonably well and only activates when there are sustained changes in ambient noise as you move between different locations, but I’m old-school and prefer controlling volume myself rather than letting algorithms do it. The Pixel Buds A-Series still support Android’s Fast Pair feature for quick setup. On Pixel smartphones, the companion app is built in, but you can also grab it from the Play Store on other Android phones. With it, you can locate your earbuds, toggle settings like bass boost and in-ear detection (another thing Google didn’t skimp on), or check battery levels for the earbuds and case. No such app exists for iOS, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3mqhCP"&gt;By holding onto a lot of what worked best on the 2020 Pixel Buds — namely sound quality and hands-free voice controls — and improving other parts that didn’t, Google has ended up with an appealing set of $99 earbuds. The Pixel Buds A-Series haven’t fully stamped out the biggest issue that dragged down their pricier older sibling, and the level of outside noise your tunes compete against will turn some people away. But even with some of the things Google left out, you’re getting a better overall product for less money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United Airlines is buying 15 supersonic aircraft from Boom Supersonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrKs2FNzivDmDw2nq09_bJ8UFTI=/158x0:1862x1136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69388852/img.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mq8GZi"&gt;United Airlines has agreed to purchase 15 supersonic aircraft from Boom Supersonic, with an option to increase that order to 35 jets, the companies announced Thursday. That agreement, though, is still subject to change depending on the outcome of United’s safety testing and also Boom’s ability to deliver on its promises despite never having built or flown a full-scale supersonic jet before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUYjIy"&gt;If Boom’s Overture jets pass inspection, the plan is for them to be rolled out in 2025, fly in 2026, and expected to carry passengers by 2029. At that point, Boom claims its supersonic jets will eventually be able to travel from New York to London — normally a seven-hour flight — in just 3.5 hours, or Los Angeles to Sydney — typically a 15-hour trip — in six hours and 45 minutes. Tickets will cost $5,000 per seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Coen18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a stellar flight experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EZIs9X"&gt;“Boom’s vision for the future of commercial aviation, combined with the industry’s most robust route network in the world, will give business and leisure travelers access to a stellar flight experience,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="71hk2X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the United supersonic fleet.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@United&lt;/a&gt; will purchase up to 50 Overture airliners and fly the fleet on 100% sustainable aviation fuels. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zVG2aMCVKx"&gt;https://t.co/zVG2aMCVKx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoomSupersonic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BoomSupersonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/kg9eoFT2Ww"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kg9eoFT2Ww&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boom Supersonic (@boomaero) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boomaero/status/1400406948546220036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g69k05"&gt;It’s the latest deal for Boom, the startup that has been focused on resurrecting commercial supersonic air travel. In addition to United, the company has contracts or memorandum of understanding with Rolls-Royce and the US Air Force. Boom has raised $240 million in funding and fielded preorders from Virgin Group (which is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11298798/virgin-group-boom-supersonic-airplanes-concorde"&gt;working on its own supersonic jet&lt;/a&gt;) and Japan Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPyPib"&gt;To be sure, Boom has only just revealed its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505653/boom-supersonic-reveal-xb1-demonstrator-speed"&gt;full-scale XB-1 demonstrator aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to take its inaugural flight in 2021. At 71 feet long, the XB-1 is a scaled-down version of the full production model that Boom hopes to have ready for passengers by 2029. The prototype only has room for the pilot, while the commercial-ready version will eventually hold up to 88 passengers and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wZBMv"&gt;The demonstrator is expected to reach speeds of Mach 1.3, thanks to its three J85-15 engines, which are manufactured by General Electric, primarily for military aircraft. By comparison, the full-scale Overture jet will be 205 feet long, have a cruising altitude of 60,000 feet, and achieve speeds of Mach 1.7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZF5Qwtg0AvfRmSH9TsK4qD4Av0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22571361/united_interior_2x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ermPDpKK8Pso84I20vBVGDP49rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22571418/united_hero_2x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j6qGf7"&gt;Both companies claim the jets will be “net-zero carbon from day one [and] optimized to run on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.” But neither provided additional details about what kinds of fuel they would be using or how they would achieve net-zero carbon emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2uPce"&gt;Environmental groups are worried that faster speeds will equal more pollution into the environment. The global aviation industry produces around 2 percent of all human-induced CO2 emissions, but supersonic jets are known to be far more polluting. Boom says it will be carbon-neutral as a goal, but simply put, it takes more fuel to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yRwKIO"&gt;&lt;q&gt; it takes more fuel to go faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bl8Kta"&gt;Boom is behind schedule, having promised to begin flight tests by 2017 in the hopes of ferrying real passengers in 2020. Now, that timeline has been set back nearly a decade. There hasn’t been a supersonic commercial jet in operation since Concorde, constructed by French aerospace company Aérospatiale and British Aircraft Corporation, was &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2016/11/2/13409324/supersonic-flight-concorde"&gt;retired after 27 years of service in 2003&lt;/a&gt;. Concorde was a gas-guzzler and a money-loser for Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLVwO"&gt;Boom is also testing new technologies that could muffle the sonic boom that occurs when a supersonic airplane breaks the sound barrier. These cannon-blast booms led Congress to ban supersonic jets from flying over US soil in 1973. But in October 2018, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-302-law/"&gt;signed a bill&lt;/a&gt; directing the Federal Aviation Administration to consider lifting the ban. It’s unclear where President Joe Biden, who has made infrastructure and climate change a hallmark of his early days in office, stands on supersonic travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlwj7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlodG3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uKGdi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xapei5"&gt;It’s the sort of thing that can almost pass for background noise these days: over the past week, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/autonomous-drone-attacked-soldiers-in-libya-all-on-its-own/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flying-killer-robot-hunted-down-a-human-target-without-1847001471"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/autonomous-drone-attacked-soldiers-in-libya-all-on-its-own/"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; tentatively declared, based on a UN report from the Libyan civil war, that killer robots may have hunted down humans autonomously for the first time. As one headline &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flying-killer-robot-hunted-down-a-human-target-without-1847001471"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “The Age of Autonomous Killer Robots May Already Be Here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UYXdc"&gt;But is it? As you might guess, it’s a hard question to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FfF7q"&gt;The new coverage has sparked a debate among experts that goes to the heart of our problems confronting the rise of autonomous robots in war. Some said the stories were wrongheaded and sensational, while others suggested there was a nugget of truth to the discussion. Diving into the topic doesn’t reveal that the world quietly experienced the opening salvos of the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; timeline in 2020. But it does point to a more prosaic and perhaps much more depressing truth: that no one can agree on what a killer robot &lt;em&gt;is, &lt;/em&gt;and if we wait for this to happen, their presence in war will have long been normalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQoyWv"&gt;It’s cheery stuff, isn’t it? It’ll take your mind off the global pandemic at least. Let’s jump in: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ftALl1"&gt;What’s the actual news here? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JYGA"&gt;The source of all these stories is a 548-page report from the United Nations Security Council that details the tail end of the Second Libyan Civil War, covering a period from October 2019 to January 2021. The report was published in March, and you can &lt;a href="https://undocs.org/S/2021/229"&gt;read it in full here&lt;/a&gt;. To save you time: it is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; thorough account of an &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;complex conflict, detailing various troop movements, weapon transfers, raids and skirmishes that took place among the war’s various factions, both foreign and domestic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CsGHt9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;News stories were based on just two paragraphs from a UN report&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7BZQb"&gt;The paragraph we’re interested in, though, describes an offensive near Tripoli in March 2020, in which forces supporting the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) routed troops loyal to the Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar (referred to in the report as the Haftar Affiliated Forces or HAF). Here’s the relevant passage in full: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DWybQy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logistics convoys and retreating HAF were subsequently hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM Kargu-2 (see annex 30) and other loitering munitions. The lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the munition: in effect, a true “fire, forget and find” capability.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HvHL0G"&gt;The Kargu-2 system that’s mentioned here is a &lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt;quadcopter built in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;: it’s essentially a consumer drone that’s used to dive-bomb targets. It can be manually operated or steer itself using machine vision. A second paragraph in the report notes that retreating forces were “subject to continual harassment from the unmanned combat aerial vehicles and lethal autonomous weapons systems” and that the HAF “suffered significant casualties” as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VkRjpbJNC8_GQFyXqazeLOpv_48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556972/Screen_Shot_2021_06_03_at_2.28.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: STM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kargu-2 drone is essentially a quadcopter that dive-bombs enemies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NJTAC"&gt;But that’s it. That’s all we have. What the report doesn’t say — at least not outright — is that human beings were killed by autonomous robots acting without human supervision. It says humans and vehicles were &lt;em&gt;attacked&lt;/em&gt; by a mix of drones, quadcopters, and “loitering munitions” (we’ll get to those later), and that the quadcopters had been programmed to work offline. But whether the attacks took place without connectivity is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rd8K3n"&gt;These two paragraphs made their way into the mainstream press via a story in &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2278852-drones-may-have-attacked-humans-fully-autonomously-for-the-first-time/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which ran a piece with the headline: “Drones may have attacked humans fully autonomously for the first time.” The &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; is very careful to caveat that military drones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have acted autonomously and that humans &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have been killed, but later reports lost this nuance. “Autonomous drone attacked soldiers in Libya all on its own,” read one headline. “For the First Time, Drones Autonomously Attacked Humans,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75GYFQ"&gt;Let’s be clear: by itself, the UN does not say for certain whether drones autonomously attacked humans in Libya last year, though it certainly suggests this could have happened. The problem is that even if it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen, for many experts, it’s just not news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7XOznb"&gt;The problem of defining “killer robots”&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FrRDid"&gt;The reason why some experts took issue with these stories was because they followed the UN’s wording, which doesn’t distinguish clearly between loitering munitions and lethal autonomous weapons systems or LAWS (that’s policy jargon for killer robots). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec9mcB"&gt;Loitering munitions, for the uninitiated, are the weapon equivalent of seagulls at the beachfront. They hang around a specific area, float above the masses, and wait to strike their target — usually military hardware of one sort or another (though it’s not impossible that they could be used to target individuals). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7DjWh"&gt;The classic example is Israel’s IAI Harpy, which was developed in the 1980s to target anti-air defenses. The Harpy looks like a cross between a missile and a fixed-wing drone, and is fired from the ground into a target area where it can linger for up to nine hours. It scans for telltale radar emissions from anti-air systems and drops onto any it finds. The loitering aspect is crucial as troops will often turn these radars off, given they act like homing beacons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ka8B3l5KTFYULQNZVbWh-CAbSzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556979/Harpy_NG_1021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: IAI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IAI Harpy is launched from the ground and can linger for hours over a target area. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrD8dI"&gt;“The thing is, how is this the first time of anything?” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RikeFranke/status/1399670524998000640"&gt;tweeted Ulrike Franke&lt;/a&gt;, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Loitering munition have been on the battlefield for a while - most notably in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict"&gt;Nagorno-Karaback&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to me that what’s new here isn’t the event, but that the UN report calls them lethal autonomous weapon systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qb5Ixr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the line between something being autonomous and being automated has shifted over the decades”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCP7yL"&gt;Jack McDonald, a lecturer at the department of war studies at King’s College London, says the distinction between the two terms is controversial and constitutes an unsolved problem in the world of arms regulation. “There are people who call ‘loitering munitions’ ‘lethal autonomous weapon systems’ and people who just call them ‘loitering munitions,’” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a huge, long-running thing. And it’s because the line between something being autonomous and being automated has shifted over the decades.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDGraf"&gt;So is the Harpy a lethal autonomous weapons system? A killer robot? It depends on who you ask. IAI’s own website &lt;a href="https://www.iai.co.il/p/harpy"&gt;describes it as such&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “an autonomous weapon for all weather,” and the Harpy certainly fits a makeshift definition of LAWS as “machines that target combatants without human oversight.” But if this is your definition, then you’ve created a very broad church for killer robots. Indeed, under this definition a land mine is a killer robot, as it, too, autonomously targets combatants in war without human oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="x4OEjl"&gt;Artificial intelligence makes it worse&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="rjjJ8l"&gt;If killer robots have been around for decades, why has there been so much discussion about them in recent years, with groups like the Campaign To Stop Killer Robots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786080/united-nations-un-autonomous-killer-robots-regulation-conference"&gt;pushing for regulation of this technology in the UN&lt;/a&gt;? And why is this incident in Libya special? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fat8eM"&gt;The rise of artificial intelligence plays a big role, says Zak Kallenborn, a policy fellow at the Schar School of Policy and Government. Advances in AI over the past decade have given weapon-makers access to cheap vision systems that can select targets as quickly as your phone identifies pets, plants, and familiar faces in your camera roll. These systems promise nuanced and precise identification of targets but are also much more prone to mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HYoeGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI vision has been proven to be brittle, time and time again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RaK2yO"&gt;“Loitering munitions typically respond to radar emissions, [and] a kid walking down the street isn’t going to have a high-powered radar in their backpack,” Kallenborn tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But AI targeting systems might misclassify the kid as a soldier, because current AI systems are highly brittle — one study showed &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf"&gt;a change in a single pixel&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient to cause machine vision systems to draw radically different conclusions about what it sees. An open question is how often those errors occur during real-world use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hPeNh"&gt;This is why the incident in Libya is interesting, says Kallenborn, as the Kargu-2 system mentioned in the UN report does seem to use AI to identify targets. According to the quadcopter’s manufacturer, STM, &lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/uploads/docs/1579732425_kargu-en.pdf?"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stm.com.tr/en/kargu-autonomous-tactical-multi-rotor-attack-uav"&gt; uses&lt;/a&gt; “machine learning algorithms embedded on the platform” to “effectively respond against stationary or mobile targets (i.e. vehicle, person etc.)” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqv9yaPLhEk&amp;amp;ab_channel=STM"&gt;Demo videos&lt;/a&gt; appear to show it doing exactly that. In the clip below, the quadcopter hones in on a mannequin in a stationary group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3wYo5n"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auRlh-f2wwQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgzcvn"&gt;But should we trust a manufacturers’ demo reel or brochure? And does the UN report make it clear that machine learning systems were used in the attack? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbbuxF"&gt;Kallenborn’s reading of the report is that it “heavily implies” that this was the case, but McDonald is more skeptical. “I think it’s sensible to say that the Kargu-2 as a platform is &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; to being used in an autonomous way,” he says. “But we don’t necessarily know if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;.” In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackmcd83/status/1397873682249355266"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, he also pointed out that this particular skirmish involved long-range missiles and howitzers, making it even harder to attribute casualties to any one system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lYkHgE"&gt;What’s next for LAWS and the law?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ycLCf3"&gt;What we’re left with is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the fog of war. Or more accurately: the fog of LAWS. We can’t say for certain what happened in Libya and our definitions of what is and isn’t a killer robot are so fluid that even if we knew, there would be disagreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXHlum"&gt;For Kallenborn, this is sort of the point: it underscores the difficulties we face trying to create meaningful oversight in the AI-assisted battles of the future. Of course the first use of autonomous weapons on the battlefield won’t announce itself with a press release, he says, because if the weapons work as they’re supposed to, they won’t look at all out of the ordinary. “The problem is autonomy is, at core, a matter of programming,” he says. “The Kargu-2 used autonomously will look exactly like a Kargu-2 used manually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CP27Ek"&gt;Elke Schwarz, a senior lecturer in political theory at Queen Mary University London who’s affiliated with the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that discussions like this show we need to move beyond “slippery and political” debates about definitions and focus on the specific functionality of these systems. What do they do and how do they do it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WXPh02"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there is critical mass building amongst nations and international organizations to push for a ban”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9J8gM"&gt;“I think we really have to think about the bigger picture [...] which is why I focus on the practice, as well as functionality,” says Schwarz. “In my work I try and show that the use of these types of systems is very likely to exacerbate violent action as an ‘easier’ choice. And, as you rightly point out, errors will very likely prevail [...] which will likely be addressed only post hoc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv3Y3w"&gt;Schwarz says that despite the myriad difficulties, in terms of both drafting regulation and pushing back against the enthusiasm of militaries around the world to integrate AI into weaponry, “there is critical mass building amongst nations and international organizations to push for a ban for systems that have the capacity to autonomously identify, select and attack targets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXTFvi"&gt;Indeed, the UN is still &lt;a href="https://dig.watch/process/gge-laws"&gt;conducting a review&lt;/a&gt; into possible regulations for LAWS, with results due to be reported later this year. As Schwarz says: “With this news story having made the rounds, now is a great time to mobilize the international community toward awareness and action.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s iPad Pro hub will let you pretend it’s a real desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satechi iPad Pro hub and stand" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8ifMTdAI2--42QeQ2aq-Za7xxY=/0x0:1883x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386929/satechihubstand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete your minimalist desk setup with this gadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4iZLq6"&gt;The latest gadget from Satechi &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is both a stand and a USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt; made for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models that have a USB-C charging port, as well as the 2020 iPad Air. It’s $100, and with your tablet wedged into the stand, it should look more like a traditional monitor, so you can keep on pretending it’s an actual desktop replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSDLIb"&gt;Like any hub, it gives you a handful of extra ports for expanding the functionality of your iPad. This one includes an HDMI port capable of outputting 4K at up to 60Hz refresh rate, a USB-A data port, a USB-C PD port with up to 60W of charging power, a headphone jack, and separate slots for an SD and microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BwGoZP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Put macOS on the iPad, you cowards","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZePXNEZWZtwAdr7scNALtBXRDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560318/ipaddock.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4KuKK"&gt;You technically don’t need an iPad to use this hub, as this foldable stand is compatible with other computers, tablets, and phones that have a USB-C port. Satechi does mention, however, that your device needs a USB-C PD port for “full compatibility” with the hub. It lists the last five years of MacBook Pros, the 2018 and 2020 MacBook Air, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 and Surface Go, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Google Pixelbook as viable companions to its hub. Extra compatibility is nice, but if you don’t have an iPad (and thus, no need for the stand component), you can probably find a different USB-C hub that’s no less capable for cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7PP0Y"&gt;If this product seems appealing to you, Satechi is &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knocking $20 off the cost through June 6th at midnight PT&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;IPADPRO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/news/e3-news/e3-2021-schedule-and-fan-registration"&gt;kicking off on June 12th&lt;/a&gt;. And with Microsoft and Nintendo finally having announced the dates and times for their big showcase presentations, the event schedule is starting to fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8NWN"&gt;If you want to attend the virtual event as a fan, you can now register to attend &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/"&gt;on E3’s website&lt;/a&gt; so that you can get access to the E3 portal and app. But if you want to follow along with the press conferences and announcements, we’ve put together a rough timeline of events with everything that we’re aware of. (Note that the exact times of some presentations haven’t been announced yet.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="949NMw"&gt;When is E3?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="45kdc1"&gt;E3 technically takes place from Saturday, June 12th, to Tuesday, June 15th, but you can expect some big announcements a couple days before E3 at Summer Game Fest’s Kickoff Live event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="I8pyVC"&gt;Thursday, June 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="30bqJ6"&gt;2PM ET: &lt;a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/"&gt;Summer Game Fest’s Kickoff Live event&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Geoff Keighley&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rY9aIQ"&gt;Saturday, June 12th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KVyvuM"&gt;11AM ET: &lt;a href="https://www.guerrillacollective.com/"&gt;Guerrilla Collective&lt;/a&gt; (note that this is the second Guerrilla Collective show — the first takes place on June 5th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E6goBz"&gt;1PM ET: &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/e3"&gt;E3 broadcast&lt;/a&gt; pre-show&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition review: an AMD powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Strix G15 punches above its price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OnOztd"&gt;I was skeptical of the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition when I first got my test unit from AMD. While the frame rates the Radeon RX 6800M delivered were respectable, it wasn’t decisively outperforming comparable systems with Intel and Nvidia parts. I assumed that this gaming laptop would be fairly middle of the road, without many standout features to set it apart from the pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EPJw2"&gt;Then Asus gave me the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Strix logo on the bottom bezel of the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRF9pwoAAmwXgvhxK8ICJ51csko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552467/mchin_20190821_4609_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, have a Strix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDzFWl"&gt;Well, the price range. Asus says the Strix G15 Advantage Edition will cost $1,549.99 to $1,699.99. Given that a regular Strix G15 with specs close to those of my test unit (an eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HX, 16GB of RAM, and a 300Hz 1080p screen, although with 1TB of storage) and an Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU is listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202102AM190000003/STRIX-ASUS-ROG-Strix-G15-%282021%29-Gaming-Laptop%2C-15.6%E2%80%9D-300Hz-IPS-Type-FHD-Display%2C-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070%2C-AMD-Ryzen-R9-5900HX%2C-16GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-PCIe-NVMe-SSD%2C-RGB-Keyboard%2C-Windows-10%2C-G513QR-ES96"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, I’m assuming that my configuration will be close to the top of that range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJGeL5"&gt;Regardless, a Strix for $1,699.99 is a great value. This model is delivering better performance and better battery life than I’d expect to see from all kinds of gaming laptops that are hundreds of dollars more. Given the Strix’s flashy and decidedly enthusiast aesthetic, I think it makes a bit less sense as a value purchase than something like the Zephyrus G15. But, if you’re looking for a bold and garish gaming laptop that’s punching well above its price class, you’re probably in the target audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="umnE4F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10530834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjyI64Cq2m35qIajk_Ta_U43ccA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552468/mchin_20190821_4609_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four-zone RGB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9ve0lF"&gt;This Strix is one of the first laptops announced that includes AMD’s new RX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/31/22457181/amd-radeon-rx-6000m-series-release-date-rdna2-rog-strix-g15"&gt;6000M series&lt;/a&gt; mobile GPUs, and the first one I’ve gotten to test. Given the price of the RTX 3070 model, it’s clear that’s the card Asus expects the 6800M to be trading blows with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AOi1a"&gt;For some raw results: the Strix G15 averaged 252fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, running the benchmark full of dust storms and fire blasts with no stutter in sight. The system averaged 87fps on &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, and 77fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2. &lt;/em&gt;It put up 69fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on ultra, and 94fps with ray tracing off. (All games were run at native resolution at their highest possible settings). Basically, you should be able to run pretty much any game you want at playable frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4KtaG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You should be able to run pretty much any game you want&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOZ26H"&gt;From the results here, it seems that the RX 6800M is performing slightly worse than (but comparably to) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;high-clocked RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; but is outperforming expectations for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;low-clocked RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; on most titles. It’s an upgrade from last year’s Nvidia chips, beating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ 2020 ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 2070 Super on every game. We haven’t yet gotten to review the 3080 model of the Scar, but the frame rates &lt;a href="https://www.ultrabookreview.com/44764-asus-rog-scar-15-g533qs-review/"&gt;other reviews&lt;/a&gt; have reported are better than, but not worlds away from what I’m seeing here — and the Scar is almost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GeForce-Opti-Mechanical-Keyboard-Windows-G533QS-XS98Q/dp/B08TZZRJT6?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 more&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also not too far off the what we’d expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G15-laptop-review-Eye-catcher.517789.0.html"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; with a 100W RTX 3080 on some titles (and even better on some), so given that Asus has the 3080 Zephyrus listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/compare/202104AM020000002,"&gt;$1,999&lt;/a&gt; and the RTX 3070 model listed at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-15-6-qhd-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-1tb-ssd-eclipse-grey-eclipse-grey%2F6448848.p%3FskuId%3D6448848&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,849.99&lt;/a&gt; (though both models have a QHD screen instead of a 300Hz 1080p one and more storage) the Strix is a better deal going by performance alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjHaMn"&gt;Games also looked great on the 300Hz FHD display. Asus says there will be an option for a 165Hz QHD display as well; both have a 3ms response time. While I haven’t gotten to test that model yet, the panel on my configuration is less color accurate and dimmer than the QHD screen on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;, maxing out at 291 nits in my testing and covering 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut, 76 percent of the Adobe RGB gamut, and 78 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut. So if you prefer that colors pop or you plan on gaming outside, you’ll probably want the QHD display. My configuration is better for folks who want every last frame they can get — on a title like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll see more frames on the 300Hz screen than you would on the 165Hz one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jk-nASAMp4yAFMXGtcJHcGE-uAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552469/mchin_20190821_4609_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: two USB-A, one audio jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the back of the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPwPaGFpA9yKt80pQC6yJschaB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552470/mchin_20190821_4609_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the back: one power port, one Ethernet jack, one HDMI, one USB-C, one USB-A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFegrz"&gt;Some of this performance can be attributed to Asus’ cooling, which did a decent job here. The Strix G15 has a vapor-chamber cooling system with new 84-blade “Arc Flow” fans that are supposed to increase airflow from previous Strix generations by 5 percent. The system works: it generally kept the CPU below 80 degrees Celsius with spikes up to the high 80s here and there. Temperatures on the keyboard and palm rests remained comfortable as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkDjiq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Temperatures on the keyboard and palm rests remained comfortable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsBnYp"&gt;There are a few different cooling profiles, and fans were quite audible on the Turbo profile during both gaming and productivity work. If you’re really feeling adventurous, you can set a manual profile with all power limits and fan speeds maxed out, and then you’ll hear fan noise like you’ve never heard before. (Admittedly, this didn’t do much to improve frame rates, but it was fun to try.) I never heard any fans on the Silent profile, even when I put my ear to the deck. The bottom of the chassis did get a bit toasty on my lap on Silent, though it was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9Y0vn"&gt;The G15’s speakers are also plenty loud enough that you shouldn’t have a problem hearing your game’s audio over the fans. Bass and percussion were quite audible, which I rarely get to say about gaming laptop speakers. The Strix also comes preloaded with Dolby Access software, where you can swap between profiles for games, movies, music, and voice. The Music profile brings vocals to the forefront, but I actually preferred the Game and Movie profiles for my Spotify repertoire because they made the bass stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="foDlzM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10530844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRInTK"&gt;The speakers and microphone support two-way AI noise cancellation. You can turn this feature on and off, and fiddle around with its intensity in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. The microphones had no trouble picking up my voice with and without the feature on, of course. That said, the Strix G15 wouldn’t be a great choice if you’ll be doing a lot of video calling because — as is often the case with many ROG products these days — it doesn’t have a webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j78z6e"&gt;But where the Strix G15 really makes its case is the battery gaming experience. I only got an hour of gaming out of one charge, which is a fairly short life span. However, the Strix ran &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;at playable rates for the entire time, maintaining between 30fps and 40fps for almost the entire hour, dropping to the high 20s around 12 percent, and remaining there until it died. I’d recommend this laptop to people who want to games on battery over others with more juice due to the large amount of actually playable time you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iqk4J2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life was very solid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKJa3G"&gt;Battery life on the whole was very solid. I was averaging about two and a half hours on last year’s Strix Scar 15, and while I expected this AMD machine to last longer, I was shocked by how much more juice it had. Using the Strix G15 as my daily work driver on the Silent profile around 200 nits of brightness, I averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of continuous work and entertainment. That makes it one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops I’ve ever tested. It beats what I averaged on the Zephyrus G15 with the same workload — and I’ve been singing that device’s praises all year for its efficiency. It’s especially impressive because the Strix G15 is powering a ton of RGB LEDs (though it also has a lower-resolution screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQpB39"&gt;The 280W adapter also juices the Strix G15 decently fast; the device reached 60 percent in 38 minutes alongside light Chrome use. The brick is pretty hefty, but the Strix also supports 100W Type-C charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The red hinge cap on the back of the Asus ROG Strix G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjZTDCRP7b-eKNzNge0ev66e6yI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552471/mchin_20190821_4609_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can 3D print your own hinge caps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GwAQM4"&gt;Elsewhere, the chassis has the bold and flashy look that characterizes the Strix line. An RGB light bar runs under the front edge of the deck, and the keyboard has per-key RGB lighting. My unit came with a bright red plate on the left side of the otherwise black hinge, which you can swap out for faceplates of other colors if red isn’t your speed. It won’t be the aesthetic for everyone, but it’s certainly a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pm65qf"&gt;RGB aside, the chassis feels well made and quite sturdy. The lid is aluminum, and the palm rests have a smooth, comfortable texture with an unobtrusive pattern including the letters R, O, and G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jeX7K5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It won’t be the aesthetic for everyone, but it’s certainly a look&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QuklIe"&gt;Port selection is okay but could be better. There’s one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port (not Thunderbolt, since this is an AMD machine), an HDMI port (2.0b, rather than 2.1), three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, an RJ45 LAN port, and a 3.5mm combination audio jack. The right side is port-less, but a number of ports are on the rear (including the power jack). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvDcen"&gt;ROG keyboards are some of my favorite ones you can get, and this one is no exception — it’s comfortable with quite a bit of travel. There are useful dedicated keys for volume, cutting the mic, swapping between fan profiles, and pulling up Armoury Crate. The W, A, S, and D keys are a translucent white (in contrast to the rest of the caps, which are black) allowing you to see the switches beneath. I imagine this will be a controversial choice, though I personally like the look. The spacebar on my unit very occasionally squeaked, but that’s my only complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jqz6p4"&gt;The glass touchpad is smooth and roomy — it’s 85 percent larger than previous Strix touchpads, per Asus. I had no issues with palm rejection (which was a relief, considering that my right palm was often resting on the edge). It sometimes thought I was zooming when I meant to scroll, but I’ll take that over a jumpy cursor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix G15 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-MFImj_bClitaOWhNkct_TSxqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552472/mchin_20190821_4609_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the chassis is 7 percent smaller than previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ZojJxS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10530856"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AMcvaU"&gt;All together, the Strix G15 Advantage Edition is an attractive package. There are nitpicks, sure. But at the price range Asus is providing, it’s hard to see any of them as dealbreakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGVaJ1"&gt;The question is whether you’re in the target demographic. For example, if you like the Strix’s flashy lights but want the absolute best performance you can get, you might be better suited paying more for the Strix Scar 15. If you’re looking for an RGB look that’s more subtle and refined, with a more practical port selection, you may find &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-r4-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r4-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alienware’s M15 R4&lt;/a&gt; more appealing. And if you want an excellent AMD system with all-day battery life, but don’t quite need this much power, you’ll be able to get all kinds of options, like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flegion-laptops%2Flegion-5-series%2FLenovo-Legion-5-15ARH05%2Fp%2F88GMY501444&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22465565%2Fasus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, at lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bvHC2P"&gt;But if you’re specifically looking for this kind of bold design, in an all-AMD system, at a sub-$2,000 price point, and are willing to give up a webcam and some modern ports, the Strix G15 Advantage Edition is probably the best you can do. Go much cheaper and you’re getting into territory where you’ll see significant compromises on performance. The Strix is more of a niche purchase than the lighter and subtler Zephyrus, but plenty of good laptops are. If it’s your thing, go for it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch console bundles are discounted at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdXywK8DEfSAZJ9qcuimm6J-Utk=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69385470/EPkYDYeUcAEhol3.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BsAHuu"&gt;At eBay, the highly rated seller Antonline is listing two Switch bundles that are a little more affordable than it’d be to purchase each of the included items separately. Starting with the most appealing bundle (in terms of value and what’s included), the limited edition console with an &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-inspired design comes with &lt;em&gt;New Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Snap&lt;/em&gt; and a one-year family membership to Nintendo Switch Online, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F303987333681%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeNintendoSwitchEbay060321%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22466580%2Fnintendo-switch-console-bundle-ebay-animal-crossing-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;altogether costs $379&lt;/a&gt; (usually $395). Note that &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; isn’t included with this console. This bundle would make for an extremely good gift to yourself or someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVLKbu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10544531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="1BRC8A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10545994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhPrrP"&gt;Also at eBay, you can get the best-ever price on Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 over-ear wireless headphones that have noise cancellation. Originally $349, the well-rated seller Pro-distributing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284230046954%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeNintendoSwitchEbay060321%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22466580%2Fnintendo-switch-console-bundle-ebay-animal-crossing-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling the black-colored model for $260&lt;/a&gt;. This deal hasn’t been beaten by other retailers, and it might not be beaten during Prime Day 2021 either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qWNoJA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0V72qH"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yet, digital retailer Eneba is knocking the cost of the $60 game down to just $42. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeNintendoSwitchEbay060321&amp;amp;platform=dl&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-resident-evil-village-resident-evil-8-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Add the game to your cart&lt;/a&gt;, then put in the code &lt;strong&gt;VillagePeople&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout to get 30 percent off the latest first-person horror game from Capcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="piiqNg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10492101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuRufY"&gt;Satechi announced a new stand and hub for the iPad Pro (the models released in 2018 and later with a USB-C port), and &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1554062&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=98197&amp;amp;urllink=satechi%2Enet%2Fproducts%2Faluminum%2Dstand%2Dhub%2Dfor%2Dipad%2Dpro%3Fvariant%3D39394193965144&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeNintendoSwitch060321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s 20 percent off of its $100 price when you put in the code &lt;strong&gt;IPADPRO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t tested it out, but it seems like a useful gadget if you want to pretend that your iPad Pro is a desktop monitor. It has an HDMI port (4K at 60Hz), one USB-A port, one USB-C PD port with up to 60W charging, a headphone jack, and an SD card and microSD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sNpaG8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10555017"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="zkIFut"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to turn Zoom’s audio notifications on or off </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hpr_lAu65csqHoBVgC3BpgrMRRk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69384575/bfarsace_200407_3962_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sf8HI4"&gt;When somebody comes to your door — not a virtual door, your real door — and wants to get your attention, they usually ring the doorbell. Zoom has a feature that is sort of, kind of like that: it notifies you with a loud “ding dong” when somebody enters your meeting. This can be useful if you’re waiting for a friend to show up for a Zoom meeting and are playing with your dog or dusting the bookcase in the meantime. It can also be irritating if you’re part of a meeting with ten or more people, and you hear a “ding dong” every time somebody enters or leaves the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1mXmI"&gt;So if you want to turn this notification on — or off — here’s how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To turn audio notifications off, go to the web-based Settings page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UxEUL0dM5lybKXeSO24N6pUQLyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556898/Screen_Shot_2021_06_02_at_4.46.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To turn audio notifications off, go to the web-based Settings page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mdVdN"&gt;If you’re in the Zoom app, click on your personal icon (usually in the upper right corner). Select “Settings.” Go down to the bottom of the Settings page and click on “View More Settings.” This will open Zoom’s browser-based Settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tZTiiL"&gt;Alternatively, sign into Zoom using your browser rather than the app and click on “Settings” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCbSo5"&gt;Click on “In Meeting (Basic)” in the left column and scroll down until you see “Sound notification when someone joins or leaves.” You can now toggle the feature on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WzUrzu"&gt;If the feature is toggled on, you will have the option of playing the sound for everyone who joins or leaves your meeting, or hosts and co-hosts only. You can also have Zoom ask to record the voice of someone who joins by phone to use as a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGKFbx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is getting updated visuals on PC alongside season 7 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK-kP7kvT-VdRM5iAuBW6S6c2T8=/360x0:3164x1869/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69384484/Fortnite_20210329165502.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUrL7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is getting a visual boost on PC very soon. As part of the upcoming Chapter 2: Season 7, which will launch on June 8th, the PC version of the game is getting a new “epic” graphical setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MquaUq"&gt;Epic says it will include “new and enhanced effects plus improved post-processing features and shadow quality.” Among other changes, it sounds like many of the great visual enhancements that came to the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game are coming to PC, including “more advanced explosion effects.” In other words, after you update, try to find a rocket launcher to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="od2sAL"&gt;As part of the update, the system requirements for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; are now getting a tweak. Basically, there are now three ranges: epic, recommended, and minimum. Here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tf0Q1V"&gt;Epic specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4QPD1X"&gt;Nvidia GTX 1080, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, or equivalent GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWPGZ6"&gt;4GB VRAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BbYAuY"&gt;Intel Core i7-8700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700x, or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5z9l7T"&gt;16GB RAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0gJeoD"&gt;NVMe solid state drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SYmZLo"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VuQqyu"&gt;Recommended specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MShfLo"&gt;Nvidia GTX 960, AMD R9 280, or equivalent DX11 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YKGSLk"&gt;2GB VRAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ea82aU"&gt;Core i5-7300U 3.5GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1QDqM"&gt;8GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ouJFCX"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kMzWdq"&gt;Minimum specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="07pyiz"&gt;Intel HD 4000 on PC; Intel Iris Pro 5200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AJVNwC"&gt;Core i3-3225 3.3GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="43QDA4"&gt;4GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4nnLUk"&gt;Windows 7 / 8 / 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EsBnxf"&gt;Season 7 kicks off on June 8th — and it looks like it’ll add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465577/fortnite-epic-games-ufos-aliens-abducted-teaser-season-7"&gt;an extraterrestrial element&lt;/a&gt; to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
