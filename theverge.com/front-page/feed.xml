    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1UIw3f"&gt;The Black Friday season just keeps on rolling, and we keep seeing such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;exceptional early deals&lt;/a&gt; day in and day out. If things keep up at this rate, we may all go broke by the time Black Friday actually arrives — but wow, will we have saved so much money on the coolest tech in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJeVro"&gt;As the days go on, we continue to track the latest deals we can find for you. That means we’re constantly updating our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"&gt;ongoing deal coverage&lt;/a&gt; while we check new deals that are worthy of your attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZZNoo"&gt;Today is no exception, where we have the best price ever on the AirPods Pro. The latest revision of the AirPods Pro, complete with its MagSafe-compatible charging case, has dropped to a historical low of just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals112321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That is a whole $90 off the usual price and a steeper discount than anyone else is offering. Walmart initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;required a Walmart Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now available to all. The AirPods Pro need no introduction, as they are one of the best active noise-canceling pairs of earbuds available on the market for iPhone and Mac users, with deep iOS integration and support for Apple’s immersive spatial audio feature. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oXauj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on true wireless earbuds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22792011/black-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="PEvO8V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkGe8L"&gt;If gaming is your jam, but your life needs a little more flexibility to squeeze in short play sessions, many people suggest a Nintendo Switch. While the Switch is a great console worth owning, there are some game franchises you can’t play on it. Luckily, the Backbone One controller offers mobile users a bit of that Switch-like portability by combining your iPhone with game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or your very own desktop via Steam Link. It’s also just a very good controller for many of the exceptional titles available on Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF2pSK"&gt;The Backbone One is currently available directly from &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1733403&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=107979&amp;amp;urllink=playbackbone%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone%2Done%2F&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDeals112321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone Labs for $15 off&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to its lowest yet at $85. It also comes with three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for free. Note that if you have an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max, be sure to check the box for a free, 3D-printed adapter that will ship separately. Backbone can also provide you with a printable STL file if you have a printer of your own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ofRYaW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695887/backbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="iIEBea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwxMys"&gt;Like the idea of using your phone as a game streaming hub, but you prefer Android over iOS? We’ve got you covered with a great deal as well. The Razer Kishi mobile controller for Android is a solid alternative to the Backbone One and nearly half the price. Amazon has the Android-compatible Kishi for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45, a discount of $35&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new historic low price for Razer’s mobile controller, and it’s compatible with all the popular streaming services, including Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Nvidia GeForce Now, Google Stadia, and Steam Link. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="32q9T8"&gt;A few more early Black Friday and daily deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aJpoP9"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has received its best discount so far. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is shaving $20 off the 41mm, aluminum models with GPS&lt;/a&gt;, dropping them down to $380. This includes the blue, red, green, and silvery starlight colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>NASA wants to defend Earth from asteroids — so it’s slamming a spacecraft into one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHJ4Rj1xTB-P8yj9tpTO41jjmqc=/417x0:4917x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183074/DART_still_revisedA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the DART spacecraft approaching Dimorphos&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/John Hopkins APL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Takeoff of DART is scheduled for 1:21AM ET on November 24th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="MZZ5sK"&gt;Late this evening, NASA is launching a spacecraft the size of a refrigerator, sending it on a crash course with an asteroid in 2022 — and it’s all on purpose. This intentional self-destruction will tell us if slamming a spacecraft into an asteroid is enough to save Earth in the future if a massive space rock is headed our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVjzPy"&gt;The mission is called DART, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart"&gt;or the Double Asteroid Redirect Mission&lt;/a&gt;, and its purpose is in the name. The spacecraft is going to try to redirect an asteroid in space for the first time. The idea is pretty simple: DART is going to ram into the object moving at roughly 15,000 miles per hour, transferring its momentum to the asteroid. This body slam should be enough to deflect the asteroid off its original path by a fraction of 1 percent. The asteroid DART is targeting doesn’t pose any threat to Earth, and there’s nothing the mission can do to change that. NASA just wants to see if bumping a space rock well ahead of time could change its direction enough so that over the long-term, it would whiz by a planet safely instead of hitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tP40dz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making asteroid impacts a preventable natural disaster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mLEQr"&gt;It’s a type of technique that we couldn’t have really considered 30 years ago, but with recent advances in technology, it might just be an option for saving the planet one day. “We’ve got the ability, with current technology, to be able to at least start to make asteroid impacts a preventable natural disaster,” Tom Statler, the program scientist for DART at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocdQeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planetary Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FbbCMY"&gt;A significant part of NASA’s overall charge is the concept of planetary defense: protecting Earth from asteroids or other space objects that might cross paths with our planet. It’s also the part of NASA’s mission that seems to capture the imaginations of the general public and Hollywood the most. Films like &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/em&gt; have envisioned various ways that NASA might try to stop an asteroid or comet heading toward our planet. Both of those films, though, see humans traveling to the space rock that would cause our impending doom — a scenario that would most likely never happen because of the immense complexity and safety issues such a mission would pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnmYGu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s still possible that we could be surprised one day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1637683548.056400"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt;, humanity discovers an asteroid the size of Texas just 18 days away from hitting the planet. Such short notice for a planet-killing asteroid is also unlikely, as NASA is on a constant search for such rocks. Right now, our biggest workhorse asteroid hunters are the two Pan-STARRS telescopes in Haleakala in Hawaii, which scan the sky for asteroids we haven’t found yet. Once the rocks are spotted, scientists can figure out their paths around the Sun to see if they might ever intersect with our planet. So far, there are no asteroids that we know about that will pose a hazard in the next 100 years, and we’ve found most of the largest ones that could cause global devastation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LY5FNMd9EJR6HMGeiqtoBHD53Es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037519/img_7265.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The vapor trail left by the Chelyabinsk meteor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6iYrfF"&gt;However, it’s still possible that we could be surprised one day. NASA believes it has found only about 40 percent of all near-Earth asteroids that are larger than 140 meters, or 460 feet, across — the ones that would do unthinkable destruction if they were to hit a populated area. And we’ve been surprised by dangerous space rocks before. In 2013, a meteor the size of a house blasted apart in the skies over Chelyabinsk, Russia, without any warning, causing an explosion similar to 440,000 tons of TNT and injuring more than 1,600 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRcP2N"&gt;The Chelyabinsk meteor was thought to be just 18 meters, or 60 feet, across, and it still did major damage. That’s why NASA is really eager to find asteroids that are between 140 and 150 meters across. An impact from one could lead to mass casualties, refugee crises, political instability, supply chain disruptions, and more. “If the impact were in a populated area or a technology center, that could be very severe,” says Statler. “Even if the direct effects were very localized, it could have worldwide effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNH0tA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nudge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YyoreU"&gt;To prevent such a nightmare scenario, scientists have floated lots of different ideas. Some have suggested sending nuclear devices into space to either destroy a hazardous asteroid or blow up near it to create a shockwave that would knock it off course. However, launching nukes into space is tricky to navigate, considering their use in space is prohibited under international law. Plus, it’s just incredibly difficult to actually blow up asteroids, which are typically moving through space at upwards of 40,000 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BlvLh"&gt;NASA scientists think simply nudging an asteroid when it’s still relatively far from us is an easier solution. But NASA has never tried pushing an asteroid off its course before. With the DART mission, the space agency is starting off small. The mission is heading toward an asteroid named Didymos, which is about 2,500 feet wide or roughly the height of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building in Dubai. But that’s not the spacecraft’s end target. DART is actually going to smash itself into a moonlet asteroid that orbits around Didymos, called Dimorphos, that’s about 525 feet, or 160 meters, wide. The collision will transfer enough momentum to change Dimorphos’s orbit around the larger rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4c4eaed4L1vpfhetOfDX-ANPFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037517/pd_arecibo_radar_images_didymos.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radar images of Didymos and its moonlet taken in 2003.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOGRgs"&gt;The problem, though, is we’ve actually never s&lt;em&gt;een&lt;/em&gt; Dimorphos before. We just know that it’s orbiting around Didymos because it periodically passes in front of the asteroid, slightly dimming the light bouncing off the larger rock. Based on that dimming, scientists know the moonlet’s approximate size and the time it takes to orbit Didymos. The DART spacecraft — which will weigh 550 kilograms or 1,210 pounds at impact and is shaped like a big box — is expected to change the time it takes Dimorphos to orbit Didymos by at least 73 seconds, if not several minutes, after slamming into the moonlet. It’s a process that will lead to the complete destruction of DART, what Statler refers to as an “extreme smithereen-ing event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWnk0r"&gt;But we really have no idea what kind of asteroid we’ll find when we get there, which creates uncertainty about exactly what will happen to Dimorphos. In fact, the asteroid is so small and dark that DART mission engineers may not see it until just an hour before the spacecraft hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bdZiN8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;we really have no idea what kind of asteroid we’ll find when we get there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpzNeI"&gt;“The thought right now is that it’s made out of the same thing as the main asteroid, but we don’t have any real proof of it because we don’t know anything about that moon,” Elena Adams, the DART mission systems engineer at John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Based on past missions to asteroids, NASA is realizing that the surfaces of some asteroids are very fluid and crushable, almost like liquids. How that kind of material responds to an impact from a spacecraft like DART is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow6NC"&gt;The good news is we should be able to see DART’s destruction. Just before impact, the main spacecraft will deploy a tiny spacecraft the size of a cereal box that will pass by Dimorphos three minutes after impact and record the resulting plume from the smash. That way, we’ll be sure that DART did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zo0gia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hfg6aO"&gt;Measuring a slight change in an asteroid’s path is no easy feat. But NASA has a plan for this. In the days and weeks following DART’s demise, astronomers will use telescopes to observe Didymos and Dimorphos, watching as the moonlet periodically dims the main asteroid. If the timing of those dims changes over time, that means the moonlet’s orbit has been altered and DART did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kyw87"&gt;For a more detailed look at how DART affected the Didymos system, the European Space Agency will launch a spacecraft called Hera in 2024 that will meet up with the binary pair in 2026. The mission will do a complete survey of the system to map out DART’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YHXxyL8E_PvPqWnqFtmlVS2Y_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037524/51700230393_0e4dee94c5_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket in California, with DART on top&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3HwsI"&gt;If DART turns out to be a success, imparting just a tiny change to the orbit of Dimorphos, that could jumpstart discussions about how to deal with a hazardous asteroid in the future. Perhaps we could bank a bunch of DART-like spacecraft on the ground, ready to deploy when we find an asteroid heading toward us. “It’s a broad discussion, inside and outside of government, to figure out how prepared do we want to be?” says Statler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnv4Pt"&gt;Before that happens, DART has to meet its fate, and that all begins with a launch. The spacecraft is set to take off on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket out of Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 1:21AM ET on Wednesday, November 24th. For the mission team, it’s a bittersweet moment as they say goodbye to their spacecraft, sending it toward its doom. But it’s also a pretty cool experience. “I mean, how often do you get to crash $250 million spacecraft, right?” Adams says. “Not very often.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkKgUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is a few different things. It’s a chance to spend more time with one of the lesser-known Avengers, it’s an origin story for an up-and-coming hero, and it’s a detective drama set amidst the backdrop of Christmas in New York City as the MCU adds yet another genre to its all-enveloping fold. Most importantly, though, it’s a Marvel series that doesn’t take itself too seriously — making the first two episodes unexpectedly fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5puQE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This review contains some light spoilers for the first two episodes of Hawkeye.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WujvMW"&gt;Though it’s named after the bow-wielding Avenger, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; really is a story about two people. Yes, one of those is Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), a surly hero and one-time vigilante who is now doing his best to enjoy life with his kids who were originally killed as part of Thanos’ genocidal plan. In a stereotypical Christmas in New York montage, we see Clint and his family attending a musical (a goofy show about the Avengers that features a singing Hulk) and taking his kids out for Chinese food. As much as he tries to be happy, though, time and countless battles have taken their toll. He spaces out, gets annoyed when recognized in public, and now sports a hearing aid after standing too close to a few too many explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWuPrc"&gt;The other side of the story is Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who grew up idolizing Hawkeye to the point that she became a state champion archer. Their stories intersect when Kate rescues and then dons the costume of the Ronin — &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ronin%27s_Campaign"&gt;a key part of Clint’s story in the MCU&lt;/a&gt; — and gets into a fight with a criminal syndicate known as the Tracksuit Mafia. When Clint sees the Ronin suit on the news, he’s forced to ditch his idyllic family time to figure out what’s going on. Eventually, the two archers join forces, though, naturally, Clint is a reluctant partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q96olk"&gt;There’s a mystery at play here surrounding the Ronin suit, but the highlight of the show is the growing, often adversarial, relationship between Kate and Clint. The original Hawkeye, of course, wants nothing to do with it. He’s just trying to fix everything as quickly as possible and get back to his family. At one point, he actually tells Kate that she’s ruining his Christmas. Meanwhile, this is a moment Kate has been dreaming about since she was young, and she doesn’t want to let it go. They have a great kind of combative chemistry, seemingly always approaching problems from the exact opposite perspective. At one point, Clint gives her his phone number but warns that it’s only for emergencies. No personal calls, or else he’ll “block and delete you.” As he walks away, Kate shouts out, “Call you later!” The chemistry is strong enough that even one of the least-charming characters in the MCU becomes likable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QB7lqR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3aXPMA1Jac?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqLfHf"&gt;This contrast between self-serious, cynical Clint and his more energetic and charming counterpart is what makes the show work early on. It extends beyond the characters as well. There are times when &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; looks and feels like a gritty drama, like during its Daredevil-style fight sequences or when Clint is exasperated dealing with fans trying to take selfies with him in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSqrZV"&gt;But it’s balanced out nicely because of all the more lighthearted moments. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is at its best when it’s putting Clint, in particular, in ridiculous scenarios; at one point, he’s forced to participate in a LARP despite very clearly not wanting to participate in the imaginary battle. My personal favorite moment was when a group of mobsters start bickering about NY real estate when someone makes fun of their warehouse hideout. There’s even a dog who eats pizza named Pizza Dog (just one of many nods to Matt Fraction and David Aja’s run on the &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; comics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UaBjd"&gt;Not everything about &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; works — its serious moments can come off a little heavy-handed, like some “Thanos was right” graffiti in a bathroom, and I’m not fully sold on the Christmas theme just yet — but its first two episodes leave a solid initial impression. Like the best of the MCU on Disney Plus so far, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577248/loki-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; stands on its own &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough to largely avoid superhero fatigue. That could change as the show continues and connects more to the overarching MCU. But early on, it manages to make a show about the least-fun Avenger into something with a surprising amount of heart and humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1ArNU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;debuts on Disney Plus on November 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arc raises $30 million to power its electric boat ambitions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UDBooDQv13lluJ9e_Q1bU2K5_E=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182942/Arc_One___Dock_Interior.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jAJH1t"&gt;Electric boat startup Arc has raised $30 million just five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;coming out of stealth mode&lt;/a&gt; and has started putting its first prototype through its paces. The Series A funding round was led by Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures and a former vice president of production at Tesla. The round also includes existing Arc investors like Andreessen Horowitz and celebrities like Will Smith, Kevin Durant, and Sean “Diddy” Combs, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/"&gt;first put money into the startup in October&lt;/a&gt; through their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8tqvl"&gt;Arc aims to sell a limited number of its first electric boat, the 24-foot Arc One, at an extraordinary price of $300,000 before moving on to making more affordable boats. It plans to justify that price by promising a much lower cost of ownership than gas-powered boats, as well as far easier maintenance and upkeep. Arc founder Mitch Lee is also unabashed that the startup is targeting the types of high-net-worth individuals like the celebrities who’ve invested in the company as its first customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxqVDb"&gt;“That is very much an indication of where we want to take this company from a brand and lifestyle perspective,” Lee said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSftgZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like other startups, Arc is starting at the very high end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNOYYa"&gt;Arc plans for its first boat to have a 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack capable of powering an electric motor with at least 475 horsepower. It will have a top speed of around 40 miles per hour and can last about four hours under power before needing to be recharged — which the startup claims is plenty for a day out on the water. One big claimed advantage of the Arc One’s design over other early electric boats is that it can be used for watersports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Du3E"&gt;After that, Lee plans to take the money generated from Arc One sales and put it back into research and development to make a more affordable version that the startup could sell thousands of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KTgDYb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric boat startup Arc wants to make a big splash ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cMzXPM"&gt;Lee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Arc was planning to move quickly, but he said this week that the investment from Eclipse will make it possible to accelerate the startup’s plans. Arc has already been testing a prototype on the water — Lee said one employee has even water skied behind it — and that Arc is “nearing completion on a pre-production version of the Arc One.” The company will begin limited production of the boat at its shop in Los Angeles, California, “in the coming weeks” and start deliveries “shortly thereafter,” Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv9I7J"&gt;Arc already boasts a few former SpaceX employees, but Lee (who came from Credit Karma) said the new funding will help the startup hire in an increasingly competitive electric watercraft market — one that General Motors even dipped into this week when it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796986/gm-pure-watercraft-investment-electric-boats"&gt;an investment in Pure Watercraft&lt;/a&gt;, which makes electric motors and batteries for boats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5DQe5"&gt;Broadly, though, Lee said he thinks Arc has a lot of advantages when it comes to hiring talent that may otherwise have planned to go to automotive EV startups like Rivian or established players like Tesla. Arc employees are more likely to “own” a bigger portion of the development of the boat, as opposed to maybe just a side mirror like at a car company, he said. But most of all, Lee said, “boats are a fun product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kFsha"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8kgVo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid calls for CEO resignation, Activision Blizzard announces a workplace committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wZa9_hKpCXZokWDj2HmqQECElhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182816/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbdEJC"&gt;In the fight against ongoing allegations of harassment, discrimination, and complaints of insufficient action to address such allegations, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors has announced that the publisher is forming a new committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9yzjdm"&gt;The Activision Blizzard board of directors today announced that it has formed a ‘Workplace Responsibility Committee,’ initially comprised of two independent directors, to oversee the company’s progress in successfully implementing its new policies, procedures, and commitments to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rIb8WE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — delivered at an extremely late hour during an employee holiday week granted hours before the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a damning &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;reaffirms the board’s support for CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as major publishers express concern about and evaluate relationships with Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsIufJ"&gt;Late last week, Nintendo joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; to become the latest publisher to internally criticize the company. According to a report from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-issues-internal-response-to-activision-blizzard-reports/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fanbyte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser wrote an email saying, “I find these accounts distressing and disturbing. They run counter to my values as well as Nintendo’s beliefs, values, and policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0sQz4"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s new committee will ensure regular progress updates to the board concerning key accountability measures while promising to add a “new, diverse director to the board.” Meanwhile, as external pressure mounts, a cohort of shareholders have demanded Kotick’s resignation while employees staged a second walkout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;created a petition&lt;/a&gt; with over 1,800 signatures similarly demanding the CEO step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ZD5l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSqrUb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche acquires a majority stake in high-end electric bike maker Greyp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo_UXI3w91huw-0LKirvKPaHo6w=/2x0:1199x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182725/download__3_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZwNae"&gt;Croatian electric bike manufacturer Greyp Bikes has a new majority shareholder: Porsche. The sports car manufacturer’s venture capital arm, Porsche Ventures, has held a stake of around 10 percent in the e-bike company since 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwEMmW"&gt;Greyp (pronounced like the fruit) was founded Mate Rimac — aka &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55938754"&gt;“Croatia’s Elon Musk”&lt;/a&gt; — the brainchild behind electric supercar startup Rimac Automobili. The company makes highly connected, extremely powerful electric mountain bikes, including the $10,000 flagship, full-suspension G6. The company sells its bikes in Europe and recently launched its US operations based in San Pedro, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHxnne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investment is another sign of Porsche’s confidence in Rimac’s business prowess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlgeVL"&gt;The investment is another sign of Porsche’s confidence in Rimac’s business prowess. The automaker also owns a small stake in Rimac Automobili, which it bought at the same time it initially purchased shares in Greyp. Rimac recently announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563898/bugatti-rimac-electric-supercar-acquisitoin-deal"&gt;taking over Bugatti&lt;/a&gt; from Porsche’s parent company, Volkswagen, to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Em4kx"&gt;The increased investment comes at a time of accelerated growth in the world of e-bikes. Sales of e-bikes are growing faster than traditional bikes in most major markets. The pandemic was a big factor, with sales increasing 145 percent from 2019 to 2020, more than double the rate of non-motorized bikes, according to the market research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR66yp"&gt;Porsche characterized the decision to take a controlling interest in Greyp as part of its broader plan to invest in zero- and low-emission vehicles, including plug-in hybrid vehicles and the all-electric Porsche Taycan. The company has said it will have a carbon neutral “balance sheet” by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4afmL"&gt;Porsche is no stranger to the world of e-bikes. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313508/porsche-electric-bike-ebike-sport-cross-specs-price"&gt;the automaker unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a pair of high-priced, full-suspension electric mountain bikes, the Sport and the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKjln"&gt;The Sport is a road bike intended for everyday use, with a full-suspension carbon fiber frame, integrated front and rear lights, Shimano mid-drive motor, and a $10,700 price tag. The Cross, which is more for off-roading adventures, sports a Shimano mid-drive, carbon fiber frame, and full suspension frame, in addition to Magura-MT Trail hydraulic disc brakes that are extra-large and “heat resistant.” It weighs 48.7 pounds and retails for $8,549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVOs7T"&gt;Porsche is the latest company specializing in combustion engine vehicles to dip a toe into the world of electric two-wheelers. Often, when you hear about car companies releasing their own electric bikes, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate cost-cutting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But occasionally, something interesting emerges, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Harley-Davidson’s recently released Serial 1 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit winds down Dubsmash, but its video creation tools live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HoouZmlFObs57Mnvu-BE-EdD62E=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182695/reddit_new_filters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nrE5ni"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features"&gt;Reddit will shut down&lt;/a&gt; its short-form video platform, Dubsmash, on February 22nd, 2022. After February, the app will no longer be available on apps stores and will stop functioning on devices that already have the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Feyuj"&gt;A competitor to TikTok, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;Dubsmash was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit late last year with the purpose of embedding its video creation tools into the larger platform. Now that the integration is nearing completion, Reddit is introducing a slew of new video creation tools to its own TikTok-like video feed, courtesy of the Dubsmash team that came over with the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXEpm"&gt;“Our primary focus, in terms of the acquisition, was around bringing in the expertise from the team, as well as bringing in the technology that we had built over the past five years at Dubsmash,” said Suchit Dash, the vice president of video at Reddit and a co-founder of Dubsmash, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQ5BPi7wYAM-gm8510dYN2JR9m8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035065/bread_gif_face_reddit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LCX8hE"&gt;As a part of the update, Reddit is overhauling its camera — it’s adding features that let you change the speed of your video, set a timer, adjust and trim multiple clips, as well as upload videos to the platform in landscape, portrait, and fill modes. Reddit is also devising exclusive lenses, including one that puts your (or your pet’s) face inside a slice of bread, as well as another that plants the antenna from Snoo (Reddit’s mascot) atop your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZmsXH"&gt;The platform is implementing a more full-featured editing screen as well, which should make it easier to edit videos in-app rather than force you to use external editing tools. It will now let you apply filters, add voiceovers, make volume adjustments, use stickers, rearrange your clips, and experiment with its drawing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vmk58C"&gt;While a number of Dubsmash’s innovations are coming over to Reddit, it may struggle to recreate &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/30/951627331/dubsmash-creators-of-color-say-they-deserve-credit-and-money-on-tiktok"&gt;Dubsmash’s vibrant community&lt;/a&gt;. Since Dubsmash’s initial 2014 debut, the app became &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/reddit-buys-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-black-latinx-creators-1234655872/"&gt;a hub for many Black and Latinx creators&lt;/a&gt;, who will have to jump to another app — or maybe even Reddit — ahead of its closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YwqR2W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re starting largely with our mobile clients, but we have ambition to go beyond that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI5Ydk"&gt;Dash said that video is now picking up in popularity on Reddit itself. “It’s one of our fastest-growing content types,” he said. This year alone, Reddit saw a 70 percent uptick in overall video hours watched, along with a 30 percent increase in daily active video viewers. Viewership for short videos, which Reddit defines as two seconds or less, has also risen by 50 percent quarter over quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTKIb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623724/reddit-titktok-video-feed-ios-app"&gt;The platform launched a TikTok-style feed&lt;/a&gt; on its iOS app in August, featuring an endless stream of short videos that you can downvote, upvote, comment on, share, or award. When asked when the video feed would be coming to Android, Dash told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Reddit is “beginning the process of rolling that out on Android clients” and also hinted that the same video feed may be coming to web as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZxQII"&gt;“Our goal is to make sure that we can actually allow for everyone who’s on Reddit — regardless of the platform that they use — to have a great video experience,” Dash said. “We’re starting largely with our mobile clients, but we have ambition to go beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ1wYY"&gt;As to whether Reddit has any plans to integrate sounds or music into its creation tools, which TikTok popularized and other social platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785043/snapchat-sony-music-major-labels"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; quickly caught on to, it looks like that’s not happening anytime soon. “We’re always really excited to see new use cases for creators, so no plans for us,” Dash told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But we’re always exploring new ways of what we can bring to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 10 is coming to the six-year-old Fairphone 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9thYGVNA03I7__AH41dobgbzCB8=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182551/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015’s Fairphone 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9aouK"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has released an Android 10 update for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, a device that originally launched with Android 5 in 2015. The update is in beta for the time being, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F11%2FFairphone-to-upgrade-six-year-old-Fairphone-2-to-Android-10-providing-users-with-unprecedented-seven-years-of-support.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it hopes to release a stable version early next year. Alongside it, the company also plans to start beta testing an Android 11 update for the 2019 Fairphone 3 and 2020 Fairphone 3 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmzavO"&gt;Although getting an Android update two years after its original release wouldn’t normally be cause for celebration, it’s basically unheard of for an Android manufacturer to still be updating a handset six years after its original release. Only Apple comes close to these kinds of support periods and recently released its latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;iOS 15 update for the 2015 iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3avgV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beta testing of Android 10 for Fairphone 2 starts today, with the aim to be publicly available in early 2022. But the good news doesn’t end there – for Fairphone 3 and 3+ users, beta testing for Android 11 also starts this week.&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1463138305176973323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98F8Or"&gt;Meanwhile, Samsung offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;three generational Android updates&lt;/a&gt; for its recent phones. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones%2Cpixel-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g"&gt;Google has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide security updates for its latest Pixel 6 devices for five years and Android version updates for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCOPo"&gt;Offering updates for this length of time isn’t easy, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fairphone explained&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post when it released its public beta of Android 9 running on the Fairphone 2. One of the bigger challenges is that the chipset manufacturer Fairphone uses, Qualcomm, only offers support for its processors for a certain number of years. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;As of last December&lt;/a&gt;, Qualcomm supports its chips for three major OS updates and four years of security updates. However, once this support ends, manufacturers like Fairphone are on their own if they want to continue keeping their phones updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNtusy"&gt;For the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update, the company says it collaborated with its community to speed up the update process. Together with help from Indian software developer Bharath Ravi Prakash, Fairphone says the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update took just 10 months to develop, compared to 18 months for Android 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQiaZt"&gt;Today’s news will be welcome for anyone still using a Fairphone 2 who wants to benefit from Android 10 features like gesture navigation and support for an OS-level dark mode. But it’s also reassuring for anyone thinking about picking up its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt;, which the company hopes to keep supported for six years until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OPiM4A0FU-n6J8FJ4iCgZbMrU24=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70173319/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10:30AM ET, November 23rd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: In case you haven’t already plopped down cash on one of these bundles, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B09DCMWRKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s promo is the best we’ve seen yet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It includes the 128GB headset, the $49 zip-up case and a $50 Amazon credit for $299.99. That’s $100 in savings, making it the easy choice if you’re trying to get the most bang for your buck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1DtN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2XJSUmC5J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2-standalone%2Fp%2FN82E16826910033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/oculus-quest-2-all-in-one-vr-headset---256-gb-with-quest-2-carrying-case.product.100797536.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Foculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F508466743&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a similar deal&lt;/a&gt;, though in lieu of a gift card, it’s including the zip-up case as a complementary goodie without changing the $299.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8axuK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B09DCMWRKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon gets a special mention for its bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the 128GB headset, a hard carrying case, along with a $50 Amazon credit for the regular $299.99 price. Head to this link and use &lt;strong&gt;OCULUS50 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to get in on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKJoid"&gt;This gift card promo happening at several retailers extends to the $399.99 headset that doubles the storage to 256GB, which includes a $50 gift card as well. Just note that you’ll earn a gift card to the retailer where you purchased the Oculus Quest 2, unless you buy it from Oculus directly. In that case, you’ll get $50 of credit to use on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;games purchased digitally&lt;/a&gt; through the Oculus Store. If you’re a fan of creepy first-person shooters, I highly suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ux7Typ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyqXUu"&gt;You’re welcome to use your gift card however you like, but if you’re open to suggestions, I’d use it on either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ tough, zip-up case for the headset&lt;/a&gt; and its controllers, or its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap that makes the Quest 2 much more comfortable to wear&lt;/a&gt;. Each cost $50, so choose wisely (or get both, knowing that you’re spending only half as much as you would have normally to kit out your new headset).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzekPZTFqvEC621SgVNqNxikdec=/5x0:1460x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182339/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_2.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting the LG C1 OLED TV won’t be cheap, but it’s among the best options out there.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday hits and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down on a category level.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UhATMC"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uKqmoG9m" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 55-inch Q60A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; is $700 at Best Buy, down from $800. This model is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08VWBF7C1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11QJho"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uM0X6Nan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 65-inch Q80A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; with full-array local dimming is $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,400.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DUmO9L"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uPH49gJM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 70-inch TU6985 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; that’s all about size and cost-effectiveness is $600 at Best Buy, down from $750.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWWElf"&gt;Sony deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CFELaP"&gt;The 65-inch Bravia XR X90J with full-array local dimming for better contrast costs $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,500. If all you need is a 50-inch TV, this same model is available in that size for $900 from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uXT44hQ9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X90J-Inch-Compatibility-XR50X90J/dp/B08TLC4C4T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1slr8"&gt;If you want an OLED, Sony’s Bravia XR A80J with a 65-inch OLED panel costs $1,800 instead of its original $2,300 cost at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uW7MVOb8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A80J-Inch-Compatibility-XR65A80J/dp/B08TKR3WLJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IPisjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10831129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ODiTbB"&gt;A much smaller OLED from Sony is discounted at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uYGj86Hp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 48-inch Bravia A9S&lt;/a&gt; is available for $1,200, down $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gzfyQQ"&gt;LG deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WoVMMm"&gt;The most affordable OLED TV from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u0CKA2Rz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG is its A1&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available in its 48-inch size for just $900 (usually $1,200). This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, and it lacks HDMI 2.1 ports, unlike LG’s pricier 2021 OLED TVs, but it can still deliver stellar picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjEyBM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YTId2z"&gt;If you don’t want to compromise on any features, LG’s C1 OLED might be the right fit for you. The 48-inch model is $1,100 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u22rW6q4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED48C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFK81RH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down $200 from its usual price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JyDucB"&gt;For something that’s far less costly, LG’s 50-inch NanoCell 75 series model costs just $500 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u35pqIuB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-75NANO75UPA-Alexa-Built-NanoCell/dp/B08WHW3VX1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small $70 discount from what it previously sold for. Usually, jumping up to a massive 70-inch TV is an egregious jump in price, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vphRZMsd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model is available in its 70-inch size for just $750&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LBJXAT"&gt;LG also makes a NanoCell 90 series TV that has full-array dimming zones for improved fidelity in low-lit or high contrast scenes. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u87RD6b5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get a 55-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $900 at Best Buy, down from its original $1,100 price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="26F66P"&gt;Insignia deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6eCx"&gt;Insignia’s televisions cost significantly less than any of the brands above. While they likely can’t win in a head-to-head competition for panel and backlighting quality against many other LED TVs, at least they compete in terms of functionality. Each of them has Amazon’s Fire TV software built-in, so you don’t need to buy extra streaming hardware (most models come with some form of this feature, whether it’s Android TV, Google TV, Roku, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="abkwsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vauWNY9G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch F30 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; costs just $300 at Best Buy and Amazon, well below its original $550 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bClIqR"&gt;For a step up in visual quality (particularly its contrast) thanks to quantum dot technology, the Insignia F50 55-inch TV costs $400 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ve1q77bV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-55-inch-4K-Fire-TV/dp/B08X7JBQ6F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This model usually costs $650 outside of a sale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jq9k3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smFTIN"&gt;Insignia makes several sizes of each of its TVs, and you’re guaranteed to find a low price on all of them, so pick the one that works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FSv7hk"&gt;Vizio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdJyK"&gt;Vizio’s mid-range &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vWptw98X" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M7 QLED 4K TV with a 50-inch screen&lt;/a&gt; starts at the low price of $500 (usually $700) at Best Buy. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, but its full-array local dimming is an impressive feature at this price point. If you want a bigger version of the M7, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vXZiAhCw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 70-inch model is just $750&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,100) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g19Rkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJ6m"&gt;The best TV that Vizio makes that isn’t an OLED is its P-series Quantum. You can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vY9ks5Wm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch PQ9 for $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uqhrQ"&gt;Now, for Vizio’s debut OLED (a Best Buy-exclusive model), the discounts actually aren’t great so far. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3wjdxwkiv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model is $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3whqAM5hi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch version is $1,500&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off). These aren’t the best-ever prices; they’re off by a couple hundred dollars, actually. Feature-wise, they’re competitive with LG’s C1, though some people report that this model’s software is one of its weakest attributes. If you can look past some of those issues, though, it might be worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BKzbvy"&gt;TCL deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WFLXcV"&gt;TCL’s TVs are known best for their Roku integration, but the company more recently started to produce models that run on Android TV or Google TV. It’s a vastly different interface from Roku’s, and it’ll ship with a different kind of remote control, but many of the same features are there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xdbdf"&gt;But that’s not all the decision comes down to. Sometimes, specs will be different, making one model better than the other. The way that TCL names its TVs indicates its quality, more or less. Its 6-series is among the best (and most costly) it offers, while anything lower than that will be a slight step down in features and specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oYaAFX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vkS85LOI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 55-inch 4-series TV with Android TV&lt;/a&gt; software costs $380 at Best Buy, down from $450. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrjlTa3N" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you want that exact TV in the Roku flavor&lt;/a&gt;, it’s $20 cheaper at Best Buy, costing $360.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KwCAX6"&gt;Stepping up in quality, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwvQCzGU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 5-series 4K TV with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; and a 50-inch QLED panel costs $450 at Best Buy (down from $600). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwPpTZpp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL makes an identical version with Google TV software&lt;/a&gt; for the same $450 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="AyViM1"&gt;Finally, TCL’s high-end 6-series TV is seeing some great discounts, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vxAVRNIJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model with Roku software&lt;/a&gt;, Mini LED backlighting, and a QLED panel costs $700 instead of $950 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HhDMLc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2pC5S"&gt;You can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885N17CC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model of the 6-series with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; for $898, down from $1,500 at Amazon. For an even bigger &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vziiO37l" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch version of the 6-series TV,&lt;/a&gt; but with Google TV software, Best Buy has you set for $1,300 ($1,000 off its original price).&lt;/p&gt;
