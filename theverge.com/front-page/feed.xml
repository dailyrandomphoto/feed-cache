    <title>Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrSPad"&gt;No, Robinhood tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t sell off full shares of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks&lt;/a&gt; without permission from its traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9qz0P"&gt;That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. A number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTzgT"&gt;“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500,” Jett Flores, who said he was holding stock in GameStop and AMC through Robinhood, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oPcjb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The small traders planned to hold onto their stock, rather than sell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLdvA"&gt;A spokesperson for Robinhood said these small sellers are wrong about how their shares were sold. “I can confirm that claims that Robinhood proactively sold customers’ shares outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures are false,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laWYcl"&gt;On Wednesday, Robinhood warned some investors with options in GameStop and AMC that it may automatically sell off their stakes to reduce risk, the spokesperson said. But these investors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they didn’t have options in GameStop or AMC and hadn’t purchased the stocks on margin. They had purchased the shares outright, they said, and were planning to hold onto them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr6KcG"&gt;Margin orders occur when an investor borrows money from the broker (in this case Robinhood) to complete a sale, and brokers can call in those shares if they’re worried the investor can’t pay up. According to Robinhood, most of its actions have been calling in options to purchase shares — a more aggressive move, but not unprecedented. But if users fully owned their shares, as these traders claim they did, selling the holdings would be far more unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0bJ13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;saw screenshots from six traders indicating that their purchase of GameStop or AMC stock had been filled within Robinhood. Six traders sent screenshots showing that their stock in these companies had been sold, with four clearly indicating that they had been sold today. Another trader sent screenshots showing a purchase of Naked Brand stock being filled and then sold within the app. The screenshots don’t indicate how the purchases were funded or how the sales were initiated, but in several of them the app displays a message saying, “We’ve received your order to sell [#] shares of [stock] at the best available price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qykRDd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1AHtZ"&gt;Traders who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were disappointed to lose their stake in these companies. The traders had been planning to keep the stock for longer, and several said they certainly wouldn’t have sold it at the point that they believe Robinhood pushed through the transaction, as GameStop’s stock was faltering from a nearly $500 high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mp7Fl"&gt;“It’s extremely dishonest trade on their part and unacceptable,” Ian Q., who said Robinhood unexpectedly sold his shares in GameStop this morning, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2J8hJ"&gt;The surprise selloff isn’t happening to everyone — plenty of people on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (and one person I know, who told me they purchased GameStop stock days ago) say they weren’t impacted. And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEn2Ij"&gt;While r/WallStreetBets has been at the center of the frenzy around GameStop and AMC stocks, Robinhood has been the tool of choice for many of the small-time and brand new traders jumping in to take part. But this morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;Robinhood blocked new purchases&lt;/a&gt; of stock from GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and others that were spiking in large part because of purchases coming through the app. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;now facing widespread backlash&lt;/a&gt; from users, celebrities, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;re-open purchases on a “limited” basis&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YKLEt"&gt;It’s still not clear what happened to cause these users’ stakes to be sold off today. But at the very least, it means Robinhood has even more unhappy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new challenges facing college athletes on campus including legal and ethical questions about COVID-19 guidelines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWZMPSERHdYLobfzgJMQumYpxHM=/0x66:2000x1399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737762/1223311899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Students head to class at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. | E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. The platform also enables professors to track the websites students visit during their exams, and bar them from functions like copy / pasting and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KB23V"&gt;Though Proctorio and similar services have been around for years, their use exploded in early 2020 when COVID-19 drove schools around the US to move a bulk of their instruction online. So, too, has scrutiny towards their practices. Students and instructors at universities around the country have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; against the widespread use of the software, claiming that it causes unnecessary anxiety, violates privacy, and has the potential to discriminate against marginalized students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTjeK"&gt;In an email to instructors, ADA coordinator Allison Kushner and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts wrote that professors who continue to use Proctorio through the summer 2021 term are “expected to accommodate students that raise accessibility issues,” and that the campus is “investigating longer-term remote proctoring options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TRO48O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service “was never considered to be a long-term campus proctoring solution.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEdHm"&gt;Proctorio has been controversial on UIUC’s campus since the service was introduced &lt;a href="https://dailyillini.com/news/2020/04/17/proctorio-concerns/"&gt;last spring&lt;/a&gt;, and concerned students only grew more vocal through the fall 2020 semester. (Due to COVID-19, the school now operates with a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.) Over 1,000 people signed a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/uiuc-stop-proctoring-exams-through-proctorio-proctoru?redirect=false"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the university to stop using the service. “Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy,” reads the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWp9y"&gt;UIUC is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;many campuses&lt;/a&gt; where remote proctoring has faced backlash. A &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/miami-university-end-proctorio-use-at-miami-university"&gt;Miami University petition&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered over 500 signatures, declared that “Proctorio’s design invades student rights, is inherently ableist and discriminatory, and is inconsistent with peer reviewed research.” Over 3,500 signatories have called on the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-regina-administration-call-on-the-university-of-regina-to-remove-proctortrack?redirect=false"&gt;University of Regina&lt;/a&gt; to end its use of ProctorTrack, another automated proctoring service. A 1,200-signature petition urges the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-central-florida-ask-ucf-to-stop-using-honor-lock-which-is-a-severe-invasion-of-privacy"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; to dump Honorlock, another similar software, declaring that “students should not be forced to sign away their privacy and rights in order to take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5cVtd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Professors and staff&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the service as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Proctorio (alongside four other test-proctoring services), claiming that the services’ collection of personal information amounts to “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” Even US senators have gotten involved; a coalition including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Proctorio and two similar services in December citing a number of concerns about their business practices. “Students have run head on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJ1qj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdsqZ"&gt;The complaints largely revolve around security and privacy — Proctorio’s recordings give instructors and the service access to some of test-takers’ browsing data, and a glimpse of their private homes in some cases. (Proctorio stated in its &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/Proctorio-senate-response-010721.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Senators’ letter that “test-taker data is secured and processed through multiple layers of encryption” and that Proctorio retains its recordings “for the minimum amount of time required by either our customer or by applicable law.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP15AB"&gt;Accessibility is another common concern. Students have reported not having access to a webcam at home, or enough bandwidth to accommodate the service; one test-taker told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot last semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rEzh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;Students have also reported&lt;/a&gt; that services like Proctorio have difficulty identifying test-takers with darker skin tones, and may disproportionately flag students with certain disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that even the best facial-recognition algorithms make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do identifying white ones. Proctorio stated in its response that “We believe all of these cases were due to issues relating to lighting, webcam position, or webcam quality, not race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xv21w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instructors utilizing Proctorio should inform students that they are aware of the challenges that Proctorio presents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBBJj4"&gt;“We take these concerns seriously,” reads UIUC’s email, citing student complaints related to “accessibility, privacy, data security and equity” as factors in its decision. It recommends that students for whom Proctorio presents a barrier to test-taking “make alternative arrangements” as the program is phased out, and indicates that accessibility will be considered in the selection of the next remote-proctoring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A8G9C"&gt;We’ve reached out to UIUC and Proctorio for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SIPC Says It Has Serious Concerns About Robinhood’s New Product" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzgdUXSF7n4v7Fn6C3gfNJZwkN4=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737535/1073282662.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ryz6V1"&gt;Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;After some disgruntled Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7001b/do_your_part_tank_robinhoods_rating_in_the_app/"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hamiolhs/status/1354789899510149125?s=21"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWSRC"&gt;Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks&lt;/a&gt; made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW4jiB"&gt;Here’s a screenshot from the Play Store page &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-android-review-bomb-gamestop/"&gt;captured by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when the app had a one-star rating and nearly 275,000 reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaIxPEHJqzTZ02qlozLuDF8ptjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267034/chrome_Hpo3R74D42.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-android-review-bomb-gamestop/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robinhood’s page on the Play Store earlier on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UsfTya"&gt;And here’s a screenshot we took shortly before publishing this article, showing a nearly four-star rating and around 180,000 reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MHM2dDZYWqrq5PHSgArIEvCNwMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267035/Screen_Shot_2021_01_28_at_3.58.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robinhood’s Play Store rating later on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H7TQQw"&gt;It’s not outside Google’s purview to delete these posts. Google’s policies &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/comment-posting-policy/"&gt;explicitly prohibit&lt;/a&gt; reviews intended to manipulate an app’s rating, and the company says &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/in-reviews-we-trust-making-google-play.html"&gt;it has a system&lt;/a&gt; that “combines human intelligence with machine learning to detect and enforce policy violations in ratings and reviews.” Google says it specifically took action on reviews that it felt confident violated those policies, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google says companies do not have the ability to delete reviews themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xWwvZ"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood has a 4.7 rating, and we didn’t see any reviews newer than Wednesday. However, popular apps like TikTok, &lt;em&gt;Uno&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact &lt;/em&gt;also didn’t have reviews from any later than Wednesday when we checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQvQ2B"&gt;Unhappy Robinhood users aren’t just using reviews to show their ire — they’re also calling for a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. Later on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;Robinhood said&lt;/a&gt; it would allow “limited buys” of certain stocks on Friday. The company said that halting purchases on Thursday was “a risk-management decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gambling apps are coming to Google’s Play Store in the US and 14 other countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rn0PUSNmb09mwPKzRPcfVs08gGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736980/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwP73j"&gt;An upcoming change to Google’s Play Store policies will allow gambling and betting Android apps that use real money in 15 more countries, including the US, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-play-android-gambling-apps/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, gambling apps are only allowed in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032"&gt;four countries&lt;/a&gt;: Brazil, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA1zel"&gt;The new rules will be applied starting on March 1st, and they’ll permit gambling apps in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Of course, each country will have its own limitations on what kind of online gambling is legal, with some countries allowing online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and daily fantasy sports, and some being more restrictive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eZ25z"&gt;The restrictions are also complicated. Most countries only allow lotteries if they’re run by the government, but some, like the UK, don’t have that restriction. And as is often the case, what’s allowed in the US varies on a state-by-state basis. Anyone looking to release a gambling app will have to do their legal homework first, considering the patchwork of laws and regulations permitting specific types of online gambling in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of the allowed types of gambling products in the US, with the list of states each is allowed in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8mFm19HsReh1R3ZDC8wjrpyOLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266468/Screen_Shot_2021_01_28_at_12.37.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US has the largest details box by far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zvcAoD"&gt;The change won’t be opening the floodgates for just anyone to release a slot machine app. Currently, Google requires developers to go &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/gambling"&gt;through an application process&lt;/a&gt; to get their gambling apps on the Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10318510#zippy=%2Cunited-states"&gt;the new policies&lt;/a&gt; won’t be removing that requirement. The application ensures that the developer uploading the app is licensed to run a gambling operation in the country where the app will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBACt7"&gt;Before this change, users who wanted to use gambling apps on their Android phones would have to sideload them, a practice that Google &lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2019/12/06/google-could-soon-prevent-android-users-from-sideloading-apps/"&gt;has been discouraging more and more&lt;/a&gt; as time goes on. iPhone users, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;have been allowed to download them&lt;/a&gt; straight from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijC51N"&gt;Of course, it could be argued that many games and apps that are on the Play Store today already include gambling mechanics (any game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;that includes loot boxes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or apps that allow people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;to make bets on Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;). The apps that will be allowed under this policy differ in that they’ll be allowing apps that are purely made for gambling, using real money. If I could make one request to Google, it’d be to let people hide gambling apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;they’re allowed to hide gambling ads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brU20h"&gt;Google was not immediately available to comment on the policy change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia’s biggest (timed) exclusive won’t be exclusive anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0EERlykDxdZsw1grlCLc4vmPXF0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736974/VaultHeist_04.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIHdzG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; timed Stadia exclusivity is coming to an end soon, with developer Unit 2 Games confirming that the title will be making its way to PC “very soon.” Originally announced as a “First on Stadia” timed exclusive,&lt;em&gt; Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s jump to other platforms was always more a question of “when” rather than “if,” but the announcement marks the first official indication of the regular PC port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xd6mZB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia lets you share a URL to your very own game worlds with Crayta, coming July 1st ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Dosy2U"&gt;The news — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;originally spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, citing a tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;Twitter user @Yogarine&lt;/a&gt; — comes from an announcement by Unit 2 Games in the game’s Discord chat. The company promises that it’ll have more information (including a launch date and the digital storefront where &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; will be offered) in the coming weeks, but it does promise that it’s “still every bit as committed to Stadia as we’ve always been.” The new PC version will also offer full crossplay with the Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKV9g2"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style game creation game that’s built on Unreal Engine, &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;standout feature (aside from the rare status of a Stadia-exclusive title) was as one of the first games to adopt Stadia’s State Share technology, which (in theory) promised that any Stadia player could join a &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; world simply by clicking on a link. It’s a feature that’ll likely stay exclusive to the Stadia version of the game even after the PC port launches, given its reliance on Google’s streaming tech to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games Store users claimed 749 million free games last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7SqDn6Cig3DDXNHsJGw7FqiYTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qepgyE"&gt;Epic Games Store released a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;bevy of stats&lt;/a&gt; to show off how its game storefront grew in 2020 compared to 2019, its launch year. It announced that there are over 160 million accounts now on PC, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;108 million users registered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It almost doubled in monthly active users from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million last month. Epic also saw its daily active user count go up to 31.3 million, which the company claims is a 192 percent boost. Its peak concurrent player count hit 13 million in 2020, almost doubling its 7 million peak in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVJUlj"&gt;Unsurprising to no one, giving away free games each week is a nice way to keep people coming back to your storefront. (It also helps when your store is the sole provider of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PC.) There were 103 free games last year, and gamers claimed over 749 million copies. And good news: Epic has committed to continuing this popular tradition of giving away titles in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hwkvyw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic trails far behind Steam, but it’s growing at a steady pace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="43bxxW"&gt;All of this to say that the Epic Games Store is growing. Gamers spent $700 million within the PC game store in 2020, with $265 million of that being the actual amount spent by gamers on third-party games not made by Epic (excluding the value of coupons and promos used on those games, as well as the value of Epic’s own funding of these developers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5JC4X"&gt;Looking forward, Epic says it’s working to make it easier for developers to publish games on the Epic Games Store. For everyone else, it says it’s working on community-oriented features, including an overhaul to its social components, player profiles, and updates to its achievements and wishlist features. Perhaps, it’ll expand on its efforts to host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22183446/epic-games-store-spotify-app-store-ambitions"&gt;more than just games&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZ2xJ"&gt;Barring some totally unpredictable shift in tide in the next 10 years, Steam will always have bigger numbers than the Epic Games Store. But its solid performance in 2020 proves that there’s room in the industry for another competitor to keep growing. And it seems to validate that the ways Epic’s strategy differs from Valve’s (making deals for timed-exclusive games, paying developers more per game purchase) are still resonating with developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood will allow ‘limited buys’ of stocks like GameStop starting Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo:" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWWxHZ18GLihVQwhbNxTiZmANmw=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736655/twtr-nyse-26_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p7rRY3"&gt;Robinhood has announced that, beginning on Friday, January 29th, it will allow “limited buys” on restricted stocks, potentially signaling the end of a brutal day-long hold on GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgzS4T"&gt;“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities,” the company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed.” The company’s statement does not elaborate on how limited purchases will be for GameStop and the other restricted stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eZSElg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To be clear, this was a risk-management decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V1nB2W"&gt;On Thursday morning, Robinhood restricted purchases of GameStop and the other stocks, which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;driven to unusually high prices&lt;/a&gt; by coordinated activity on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. The decision to restrict purchases provoked a significant backlash, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;several congressional committees&lt;/a&gt; have already pledged to investigate Robinhood in the wake of the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLmbag"&gt;The decision to limit purchases of the stocks went far beyond Robinhood, with E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, Apex Holdings, and other providers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;refusing to book orders&lt;/a&gt; for the stocks. Still, Robinhood has been the focus of much of the backlash, including &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;at least one proposed class action case against the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw6epI"&gt;In its statement, Robinhood emphasized that the decision to halt purchases was made because of internal risk to the company, not as a response to outside pressure from other financial actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8F7Kl"&gt;“As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment,” the post argues. “To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read why r/WallStreetBets was founded and how its creator left</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7N2xrxCK7KU7pndf5wrAq3iU8Dg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736552/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yttJta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;has written an excellent profile&lt;/a&gt; of the man who started r/WallStreetBets, the subreddit that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;embroiled in controversy this week&lt;/a&gt;. His name is Jaime Rogozinski, and if you’re wondering how he’s been feeling about this whole thing, he likens it to “watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsX0vX"&gt;The article gives the impression that the subreddit, which is now trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;raise the price of GameStop stocks to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, wasn’t only created for profit — it was created for fun. Rogozinski was apparently bored with the usual stock market advice about just buying index funds and was looking for actual discussions about individual stocks. He also talks about how the community is “refreshing,” with posts ranging from “‘Look at my money!” to “Look at all this money I lost.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1BKq53"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s no longer what it used to be.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHhurd"&gt;As many classic stories go, though, the creation ends up turning on the creator. Rogozinski is no longer a moderator for the subreddit; he was booted off last April after clashing with moderators that he said “were straight up white supremacists.” This is a problem, it seems, that the community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;has been dealing with for a while&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W763Sm"&gt;It’s an excellent story, and it gives great insight into what happens when a community becomes something its creator never intended and the fallout that can have on the creator’s life. If you’ve been following the story of WallStreetBets, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;definitely worth a read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-Trade confirms it halted GameStop and AMC stock, will let you buy some Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Morgan Stanley Acquires E*Trade" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkmJZ1a7YyNaquYum46IinEIIyw=/108x0:4812x3136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736517/1207565665.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y20Wg8"&gt;Financial services company E-Trade has restricted purchases of GameStop and AMC stock, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge — &lt;/em&gt;and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;like Robinhood,&lt;/a&gt; it plans to resume trading of both stocks on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYNvPz"&gt;The two stocks have become popular on forums &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;like the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt; and seen their prices skyrocket to unprecedented highs over the past week. (GameStop hit $483 earlier on Thursday and briefly went above that during the day. Last Thursday, the stock closed at $43.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PFFqx"&gt;Here’s E-Trade’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nG8Quu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amid the extraordinary volumes in GME and AMC, we chose to limit client activity in these names late in the trading day in order to ensure that we could continue to serve our broader client base. We take actions like this seriously, and only initiate them in rare circumstances. We expect to resume normal trading operations tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FVjHDf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported on the halt on purchases earlier today, citing &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/e-trade-restricts-purchases-of-gamestop-amc-shares?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google"&gt;an anonymous source&lt;/a&gt;, and we originally published this story after we saw users on Twitter report that they had been unable to buy the stocks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images suggest Sony’s camera-focused Xperia 1 III might have a much better zoom lens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQWZwLl3UMsHlMWxsit__CC7QEk=/342x0:4040x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736338/1iiiresized.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AzD07h"&gt;An early look at Sony’s next flagship phone shows it might be getting a more powerful zoom lens, thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-sonys-new-flagship-the-xperia-1-iii-1611846138-426237886"&gt;leaked renders posted by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;. The Xperia 1 III’s rear camera bump appears similar to its predecessor’s at first glance. But if you look closely at the bottom camera, it features a squared-off housing consistent with periscope designs. Previous Xperia phones have offered standard telephoto lenses with 2x or 3x optical zoom; a periscope design would allow for 5x or more of optical reach without sacrificing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VT9iw"&gt;OnLeaks also reports that the Xperia 1 III will include 5G, practically a requirement for any flagship phone in 2021. Unlike the Xperia 1 II, it seems likely that Sony will offer 5G support for 1 III devices sold in the US, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248440/sony-xperia-pro-5g-price-release-date-news-features"&gt;creator-focused Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; will offer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2w1u5"&gt;On the whole, it looks like the Xperia 1 III will stick with Sony’s minimalist approach. The 6.5-inch display’s bezels are very thin, and Sony is sticking with the tall 21:9 aspect ratio. The 1 III should also retain the 3.5mm headphone jack — a rarity among flagships — as well as a microSDXC card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rULqlb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRT8o"&gt;Despite being a major manufacturer of imaging hardware, Sony’s phones have lagged behind other flagships in the camera department with better software. When we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;reviewed the Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, we saw an opportunity for Sony to lean into the dedicated camera-like experience that the phone can offer, rather than trying to play catch-up on computational photography. Strengthening its hardware offerings with a good-quality zoom is a solid step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
