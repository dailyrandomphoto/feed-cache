    <title>Razer’s DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse just got its first big price cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJCuS69yYlt9KF75D0wTm5xMkIY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705173/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h22_hc4_9086248124446_deathadderV2pro_gallery_1500x1000_img2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j3JQCV"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best wired gaming mice you can buy right now&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Cameron Faulkner. But if you are trying to minimize the number of cables on your desk, the DeathAdder V2 Pro is a nice wireless alternative — and it’s down to $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B08FQMBKQG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5062c6215cf5ff9fc9d97360e8b5047d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147301464983468" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gMltV"&gt;The DeathAdder V2 Pro is a lightweight mouse weighing in at 88 grams, six grams heavier than its wired variant. It has the same support for five onboard profiles and the same 20K optical sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s7bmwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDBGio"&gt;If you don’t mind wired gaming mice and you are on a budget, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B084RPZD6T/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=454c32c001a53e36c40f324f24ec24dd&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730147565467715283" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have also discounted the Razer Viper Mini, bringing it down to just $20. It’s a miniature rehash of Razer’s Viper gaming mouse. It can last for up to 50 million clicks, can handle up to 8,500 DPI sensitivity, and has six programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ymYrPN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14JBAd"&gt;Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are considered worthy of their $249 price tag. However, there are a few deals going on right now. First, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136281790037757" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Geek Squad Certified refurbished pair for $199 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, if you prefer buying a new pair, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-22?ref=mwj_cd_deal_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has the AirPods Pro for $205&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. It’s not the lowest price we have seen a new pair of these earbuds go for, but it is the best price currently available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z9uMA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxnuBn"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new smartphone that has a superb camera, but you don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F22%2F22244069%2Frazer-deathadder-v2-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-airpods-pros-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H still has an incredible deal&lt;/a&gt; on a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL. Although this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with Android 11 OS and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;will also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is increasing the price of Xbox Live Gold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eVt1tWmesVnk54aSTdgiJld8hgw=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705067/Social_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b8OtmL"&gt;Microsoft is increasing the prices of its Xbox Live Gold subscription soon. The software giant has started notifying existing Xbox Live Gold members of the changes in certain markets, and it will see the price rise by a dollar to $10.99 per month in the US and $5 for a three-month membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYVUas"&gt;Twelve-month and six-month pricing is also going up, but the increase won’t affect existing subscribers here. Three months will now be priced at $29.99, with six months at $59.99. Microsoft is also allowing Xbox Live Gold members to convert their remaining Gold time into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (up to 36 months). The conversion means if you have 11 months of Xbox Live Gold left on your account, you can upgrade to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and convert it into 11 months of Ultimate with no extra costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhyCpa"&gt;Unless you subscribe to Xbox Live Gold, this does mean the price of the service is moving from $60 a year to $120. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355756/microsoft-xbox-live-rename-gold-free-rumors"&gt;Microsoft quietly removed its 12-month option&lt;/a&gt; last year, which used to be priced at $60. Sony still offers 12 months of PlayStation Plus for $60, and it’s not clear what Microsoft will offer to justify the sudden price jump. Either way, it looks like the move is designed to push Xbox Live subscribers towards Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which offers Xbox Live Gold access, xCloud streaming, and access to more than 100 games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w148a2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many were hoping Xbox Live would go free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tEWINM"&gt;Many had been hoping, and expecting, Microsoft to scrap its Xbox Live charges altogether, or at least allow free-to-play games to access multiplayer features on Xbox consoles free of charge. That’s clearly not the case now, and for many this marks the first Xbox Live Gold price increase in years. “In many markets, the price of Xbox Live Gold has not changed for years and in some markets, it hasn’t changed for over 10 years,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/22/update-on-xbox-live-gold-pricing/"&gt;says the Xbox Live Gold team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I72RO1"&gt;The changes won’t take effect until at least 45 days after Xbox Live subscribers receive a message from Microsoft notifying them of the price increases. Some regions have already started receiving notifications, but most haven’t. “If you’re in a region where prices are being adjusted, you will receive an email and a message center notification over the next month letting you know what the new pricing is for your membership,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC8clQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 22nd 10AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated with more pricing information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The business of influence with MKBHD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P7NtAp07ZKXqw_sPRR5qSuQnuAs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704908/VRG_Decoder_Marques_Brownlee_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marques Brownlee on how he is scaling his brand&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yN9gib"&gt;Marques Brownlee is one of the best reviewers I know, and also one of the most savvy and successful YouTubers. And he’s been in the game for a long time: he started the channel MKBHD in 2009 when he was just a teenager making videos about his new HP laptop. Since then, he’s grown it to one of the biggest tech channels on YouTube, with 13.5 million subscribers, a podcast, and a growing support team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLAk3c"&gt;But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— talks that talk with the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9T9HQ"&gt;I am fascinated by the business of influence, and so I wanted to talk to Marques about the day-to-day operation of a YouTube channel where he plays every role from business development to ad sales to actually reviewing the phones. We talked about what he can and can’t scale, how he thinks about his dependency on YouTube as a platform, and what the future of his business looks like. Here’s a little news: he’s launching new channels very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AyZOA6"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9213325545" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fM7xNx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvSPrv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marques Brownlee from MKBHD Inc. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KX6NOu"&gt;Thanks for having me. Sorry in advance for all the noise. There’s going to be random noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NF4gQD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s fine. What’s the random noise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwyipi"&gt;We’re in a building surrounded by other random tenants who make noises and have construction sometimes. So it just happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGeNvA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that work for you when you’re shooting your videos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBwqgQ"&gt;Oh man. Well, usually it’s quiet until I turn the mic on or hop on a podcast like this, then they make lots of noise and we just kind of wait until noises stop. It’s not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cFbpi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got to embrace uncertainty. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72ipVu"&gt;Exactly. I’m very used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtLgCv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you run a very popular YouTube channel. It’s your channel. You started it when you were a teenager in your parents’ house. I think a lot of people listening to this kind of know your story, but give folks the quick version of that journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYJGUk"&gt;So I was a teenager in high school and was always into tech, but I had to make a big purchase: I had to buy a laptop. So I watched a whole bunch of YouTube videos on which laptop to buy. When I finally bought a laptop and saw some stuff with the laptop that I didn’t see in those videos, my natural response was to turn on a webcam, talk about those things, and upload it to YouTube, just in case someone else was watching videos to choose what to buy. That kind of snowballed into just making all kinds of videos with the laptop, and then the software, and the cooler and the mouse and keyboard, and my channel just turned into a tech YouTube channel. And here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48MmLJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So that was a very early version of YouTube, right? I don’t want to make you go back into your brain and imagine yourself as a teenager, but the instinct to make a video on YouTube then and the instinct to make a video on YouTube now feels very different. Everyone’s motivations are very different across that sweep of time. What was your instinct? How did you choose that as the best way to share what you knew rather than say, a blog post?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrQWZi"&gt;Yeah, you’re right. I don’t think there’s a lot of kids in 2009 who bought a laptop and decided to make a video about it on YouTube. I think there’s something about all those videos I was watching that I really enjoyed and they helped me a lot in my purchase decision. I couldn’t believe I was finding something that I didn’t see in those other videos. So I was like, the obvious answer is to add to that collection of information, so when someone else is choosing what to buy, they can make a better choice than I did. They can watch my video and realize something they wouldn’t have seen in the others. Video was the natural medium. I’ve never been much of a writer, so video just felt like the place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiC1Pm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were making those videos because you wanted to help people out. Now you run a fairly large operation, and I actually just saw your tweet, you’re hiring like six people. How big is your business? How many people does that have and how many people do you want it to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4Jljl"&gt;I think a lot of people, when they imagine a YouTube channel, don’t imagine very much work behind it. We put out over 120 videos last year. So it’s a team of five currently in the studio, which is a 7,000-square-foot empty box that we filled up with video gear. It’s me, Andrew, Vinh, Brandon, and Michael. That’s a combination of cinematographers, set designers, motion graphics specialists, and myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSd7FD"&gt;Adding to that is both proactive and reactive. I think we want to do more, but we also want to do better. So we’re adding writing talent and more editing talent and to take some of the work off of my shoulders, but also to be able to scale up. We’re making a weekly podcast now and we’re planning to start a couple of new YouTube channels this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjCW7z"&gt;So there’s a lot more going on, but I think the teamwork of it all is something that can be pretty underrated. There’s a lot going on behind the scenes to make the videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L21Gee"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the challenges with a channel like yours versus ours — we run a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, too — is we have lots of people on our channel. We have a big cast of characters at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. MKBHD, that’s just you. You are a pretty unscalable property. That group of people you’re bringing in and hiring, is that to help you spend more time in front of the camera or is that an attempt to scale you in a different way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn5FoW"&gt;It’s a little bit of both, actually. We look at the MKBHD channel one way, and I think that will still be me in front of the camera, but we also are planning on starting other channels that have a different look, where there’s multiple people on camera. So the scalability part comes from kind of building a smart business in a way. You can just continue making videos like normal and that can grow, and that’s fine. But I think there’s a lot of really fun stuff that’s enabled by what we have going here and we want to take advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwdhpi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you’re going to launch new channels. What are you launching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9kHep"&gt;Do I give away my cards this early?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErVaK1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhnsRa"&gt;We have the &lt;em&gt;Waveform&lt;/em&gt; podcast. I’m in the studio right now. You can see it behind me. It looks very pretty. Nobody ever sees it. We’re launching a video version of the &lt;em&gt;Waveform&lt;/em&gt; podcast. That’s going to be fun. That’ll be its own YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPyxsR"&gt;And we’re launching one other channel that I’m going to keep a secret, but that I’ll tell you will have a lot more faces on it. It will have a lot more casual content and things that people have wanted to see but haven’t seen from the MKBHD channel. And that’s going to be a lot of fun. That’s going to launch this year, too. And then maybe some more. Maybe we’ll find some other ideas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMEm0j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s both this year. First half of this year? We’re talking in the first weeks of 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usfe9O"&gt;I think spring for both. That’s the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4qY9K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s really interesting because you and I have known each other for a while and I remember one of my first conversations with you. You were just intently focused on completing a motion graphics course that you had been taking. And now it’s several years later and you’re not that deep in the weeds. You’ve just hired a motion graphics person and you’re talking about scaling your business and using your facilities in a different way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jm6fc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I always ask people, what’s your decision-making framework? But I think a different version of the question for you is, how has that changed? You’ve just been working for yourself since you were a kid. Now you’re running a large business and there are people who depend on you. How has your framework changed and how is it growing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpAZB0"&gt;So here’s the way I like to think about it, and maybe this is a weird analogy, but stick with me. First, being a YouTuber is a bunch of different jobs in one. Let’s say you’re a tech YouTuber. Part of your job is writing, part of your job is being on camera, part of your job is shooting the video, part of your job is editing the video, and part of your job is promoting, uploading, sharing, and content strategy. I thought of myself as this business that was growing and as I was making these things, kind of like an octopus where I have one arm doing one thing, another arm doing one thing, and some are more precious than others. Like being on camera, writing, and editing are very important to what makes an MKBHD video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Bd3QPP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbwWZx"&gt;But it turned out that I was able to find talented people, [and] I could cut off one of my arms and hand it to them and they could do a way better job with that part of it — whether it’s being behind the camera or cinematography or motion graphics — and really take it to the next level. So the entire channel and the entire project benefits from me not having to control every single part of it. But hiring is still a bit of a process for me. We’re looking at it like hiring unicorns, where I could hire any editor, but you also want an editor that understands the tech world, understands YouTube, and understands what makes a YouTube edit versus something for the BBC or CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVuzgG"&gt;There’s still a learning process to finding the right people for these different places, but the end goal is to find those people and keep cutting off those arms. I don’t even know what analogy I’m building now, but I want to kind of be an octopus with arms chopped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SytN3x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s an octopus with no arms, like a jellyfish situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2EK7o"&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OxyEX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting way of thinking about it, because that’s how normal organizations scale, right? You delegate some chunk of the work to someone else, you put them in charge, you hold them accountable for it. It’s still your face on the channel, though. So even if you send work out, you’ve still got to manage it and hold people to your standards. The thing you said about finding people who understand YouTube is really interesting to me because those people tend to be YouTubers, but they don’t necessarily get to be YouTubers and then come work for you. How do you manage that dynamic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXGLQe"&gt;That’s definitely something we think about a lot. So part of it is, you find people who are either already YouTubers and willing to put that skill towards something new. And we also highly encourage people to just do their thing, freelance, and run their own channels on the side. But it’s kind of tough finding that right person. That’s why it’s taken so long. We have five people here now. I’m sure I would have been hiring all year last year if there wasn’t a pandemic. It’s definitely a process trying to find the people who will actually be dedicated to the exact thing you’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oizYbg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting, you’ve said “we” a couple of times. Who’s the “we” in your equation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UJxv1"&gt;So I still have a couple of my precious arms. I still edit 99 percent of everything. I have the motion graphics artist and cinematographer, Vinh and Brandon, who will just go in on eight hours of editing for the first seven seconds of the intros and fun stuff like that. But I’m 99 percent of the edit, I’m writing everything, and I think at the end of the day, it’s still my face and it’s still my presentation of my ideas. Andrew is sort of a co-producer and assistant. We share the vision of how the thing grows and what we want to make. But I really say “we” because I just like to give credit to the people who’ve made it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD7UcA"&gt;When the pandemic started, it felt like a throwback where it was just me making things again. I gave everyone the chance to get home and stay safe. And I realized, this is kind of how it started and it’s really hard to make the stuff you want to make this way. It’s a team process and I like to give credit for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX7nfR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve basically shot all of our videos with my directors on Zoom and I’m just like, “man, this is not even close.” It’s very fun, and then that novelty fades and you just miss having everybody there. It sounds like you’ve got people back in your studio, you’re working as a team again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYC134"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a small business owner, what have your COVID protocols been? Is it just hoping you’re working off the best information you can get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg99Hh"&gt;Basically. And hopefully the vaccine comes as quickly as possible. At this point, we’re not traveling for anything. If you’d seen our travel schedule in the couple of years leading up to 2020, it was a lot. And actually we traveled for almost all six of the first six weeks of 2020, but we haven’t done any of that since. We’re just coming into the studio, making, and heading out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4cSzF"&gt;There’s also &lt;em&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/em&gt;, our YouTube original series happening behind the scenes. So that’ll all come out later in 2021, but that also has its own set of protocols with parts of that team coming to the studio and getting COVID tests every week. So that’s a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7HA70"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m required to disclose now that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is produced in partnership with Vox Media Studios. I have nothing to do with it, but I am told their COVID protocols are pretty hardcore. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtDSBL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One question from our video team that I thought was really interesting: as you’ve been on the path of growing bigger and bigger, you haven’t had a boss. How do you grow and improve when the audience is overwhelmingly telling you that you’re great? Where do you find the incentive or the self-criticism to improve? You’ve obviously wildly improved over time, but where does that really come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avHIZE"&gt;Oh, thank you. From the beginning, I’ve always had sort of a driving light to make what I would want to watch. And you can expand that into running a channel that I would want to subscribe to. I watch a lot of YouTube. I watch a lot of tech videos, and I watch a lot of all kinds of other videos. I get inspiration from all kinds of places. So it is great to see comments, and people enjoying the videos, and enjoying the higher frequency of videos, and the better production, and learning more from the &lt;em&gt;Explained&lt;/em&gt; series. But at the same time, there’s a lot more that I see that I’m inspired by and more stuff that I want to make. So that’s ultimately what drives me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FerI2X"&gt;It’s just an internal driving light of like, let’s try things, let’s do more, and let’s do better. I think it’s sort of a moving goalpost where we do improve and we achieve goals that we set out for ourselves, and then as we arrive at that horizon, we look forward and we see some other cool stuff we could do, and so we attack that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MsclO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me a sense of those goals. There’s some goals that are very quantitative, like we’re going to increase view counts. There’s some goals like just sheer number of videos on the channel, we’re going to produce more. And then there’s obviously qualitative goals, like we’re going to attack this format and be really good at it. How do you set and define those goals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkXWXM"&gt;Because we’re on YouTube, it’s a little bit driven by the platform. Honestly, a lot of it is tracking metrics and viewer retention and making sure you can quantitatively confirm the quality of a video. We’ve never really set view count goals, but we did have a goal to make 100 videos in the calendar year and we did end up doing that, which is great. A lot of that stuff that we’re aiming for is more, I guess qualitative is the word, but it’s hard to define. We watch stuff and we’re inspired by things we watch off of the platform. We just had this whole conversation this week with the team about how we can do &lt;em&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/em&gt; season 3 even better than &lt;em&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/em&gt; season 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siERD5"&gt;So a lot of things are just sort of an “eye test” really. It’s a visual medium, we’re making stuff for people to watch and we end up getting goals about more things we want to watch. And I think as a creator, a lot of people have that same experience. Your taste is a little bit above your actual ability. So we go out and shoot for a whole week and make a car video and we watch all our footage back and we’re like, “I think we need a camera car.” So you do the best you can with what you got, but I think you’re always looking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an6Ork"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked about your business as a YouTube business in a pretty focused way. Let’s just dive into that for a minute. How do you make money on YouTube?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1LSPy"&gt;Oh, this is the number one holiday family reunion question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBskUt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, good. You’re well-practiced at it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHbwWT"&gt;I mean, there’s the simple answer and there’s the long, business answer. I’m sure you’d probably like both. So, YouTube ads is the primary, fundamental way that YouTubers make money. You upload a video, there’s ads somewhere on it or in it, and the YouTuber gets paid for the placement of those ads because they brought the eyeballs to the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NutW1G"&gt;The deeper understanding of that is, there’s different types of ads. There’s the ads that are built into YouTube through the AdSense program. That’s one version of it. You don’t really get to control those ads, but you can still have banner ads, you can have pre-rolls, mid-roll video ads, things like that. And there’s a whole ecosystem there where you try to find a balancing act between how many ads do you place? Do you put mid-rolls in your videos or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ztt7RR"&gt;But then there’s also the integrations that you do control, which can be inside the videos. Sometimes it’s a pre-roll, you say “this video is sponsored by...” You have an integrated section inside of a video or a post-roll. You get control over that, which is often very beneficial because that’s way better targeting for the company who’s trying to talk to somebody. And then there’s all kinds of other alternate ways that YouTube channels make money. For example, we have a merch store. You can buy apparel that has our cool designs on it. We also have a podcast that’s its own format of how it makes money. I’m sure the podcasting world is familiar with that. Generally, the fundamental building blocks of making money as a YouTuber, and for me, come from AdSense built into YouTube, sponsored integrations built into the videos and on the channel, and merch stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGLKiJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone wants that merch store to be the biggest one and it’s always the third biggest one. It’s like the dream is “now I run Supreme and I make videos on the side.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjOD7X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So AdSense, that’s the YouTube ad program. That’s where Google goes out and sells the ad inventory and then you give them slots in your video. You’ve mentioned mid-rolls. You can either say there’s a mid-roll slot for Google to put an ad into or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IL3cm"&gt;Yeah. You can get as many as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSEauS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then you can just get a cut of that, but you don’t actually sell that directly. And then, the sponsor integrations, that’s where you sell it directly. And famously, I think every tech YouTuber has a Dbrand deal. So, in the middle of all your videos you say—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TZTRd"&gt;You’re welcome. All of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL1w3K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that’s where you say, in the middle, “Check out this Dbrand skin.” Or “This other product who sponsored my video.” Who makes that deal? Because that’s your deal. YouTube doesn’t get any of that money, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYoq6K"&gt;Exactly. That’s my inbox. That’s me going, “This is a product that we believe in and that we think is actually really good and worth sharing.” And the funny part of that is, a lot of these products or companies are so good that I would want to share them anyway. So, it’s kind of funny trying to negotiate what’s a great way to promote their product because it’s like, “yeah, it’s good. It’s going to end up in a video anyway, but let’s work on something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKUY1v"&gt;Something like Dbrand is perfect because it’s not a conflict of interest, where I’m sponsored by a thing that’s also reviewed on the channel. But it’s very adjacent. It’s obviously a skin or a case for a product, and we’ve worked closely with that company for a couple of years now. So yeah, we’ll find something good and work with them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76kfUk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your inbox is full of sponsorship offers from other companies. You say, “Okay. I think this is appropriate.” Who makes the deal? Who writes the contract? Who negotiates the rate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXhCay"&gt;I negotiate the rate. The contract is usually built by my agent. I work with WME. And so, their lawyers will look over the contract and negotiate the terms, so I’m not literally reading the contracts. That’s an arm I chopped off. I used to do that, too. They take their cut, obviously, for also bringing some of those contracts and companies to my inbox. But at the end of the day, if you could see the amount of stuff we say no to — it’s just like a constant flow of, “We want to be on the channel. We want to be in a video” — to find the stuff that really makes sense. And then, that’s just me going, “Let’s see how we can make this work best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbtHuz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you said WME. WME is William Morris Endeavor.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It’s one of the biggest talent agencies in the world. I think I have to disclose that Vox Media is repped by WME, too. I always err on the side of over-disclosing. That’s a company that, when you started, did not have an influencer relations department, was not making brand deals on YouTube, and now you’re saying they run your contracts for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xH4fb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the process of growing up inside of a company that’s also learning how to do this work? Did they just come to you and say, “We’re ready for you?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9bZJB"&gt;A lot of stuff like that is new because we’ve been on the forefront of it. There’s a lot of things that YouTubers didn’t do before 2014 or 2017, that [are] sort of regular and commonplace now. With WME, they had a couple ideas about how to translate and we’ve gone back and forth over time about how to work better together, and that’s been a multiyear process. It kind of comes down to saying “no” to a lot of stuff and telling them why, until we finally get it right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecygZg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what just strikes me in this conversation is, you’re describing a lot of management work. Even a conversation about how to make &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 3 better is time that you are not reviewing a phone. It’s time you’re not in front of the camera. It’s time you’re not in the edit. How do you manage your time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNfi12"&gt;I live inside of Google Calendar and Google Tasks. I would be a lost human without those things. I kind of think about this a lot — how much time I spend doing the thing versus managing how we make the thing. And it turns out that the management part has become a lot more of my job, but almost necessarily, to make it a better thing. I find that there are arms that I can cut off, if I could just exhaust this analogy —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAdoxQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re just going to go for it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5MsX"&gt;There’s arms I can cut off that are easily able to be taken up by very skilled people, and that’s wonderful to see. The management part of it is kind of not one of the arms. It’s one of the — octopi have three hearts. It’s one of the hearts of the octopus. So when people watch an MKBHD video, they’re watching me on camera, but they’re watching a lot of my words and my experiences being translated into a video form. And a lot of them aren’t really thinking about that they’re watching an edit, or they’re watching a review process, or they’re watching any of that other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2oirx"&gt;The core stuff, like management, I have had to learn over time. How to be a better boss, a better manager, and a better accountant. But the fact that I can put time into that and it doesn’t feel like I’m taking away from the edit or whatever other arms I’ve chopped off is definitely a luxury that we’ve built in over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Byow6S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I used to ask everybody who came for a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vergecast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; interview, how do you manage your time? And the reason I would ask everybody that is because I struggle with it so much. And I have the same problem as you. I host this podcast, I manage our team. I have found that I need to be extraordinarily selfish with my creative time. I need hours, just uninterrupted hours, to think about the thing I’m going to make. And then I can actually make the thing quite quickly, but the time I spend thinking about what I’m going to make is very precious. I don’t like to be interrupted. That’s one way of doing it. There are other people who just multitask all the time. How do you come out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgNu8f"&gt;I think I’m closer to you. I try to give my team here somewhat of a nine to five, to make it a reasonable workplace environment. But I don’t really ever turn it off. There’s some exceptions. There’s no team sports this year, but I play Ultimate Frisbee, and that’s my weekend. And I don’t really mix the two. But as far as my calendar, I’m very much into scheduling everything. And then they go home at five and I’m just going to be here editing for a couple more hours and just making the thing, or writing, or preproduction or whatever it is. So, some stuff doesn’t mix, and some stuff does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PV1lf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I mean, you have clients, right? You have an inbox, you have people who want to make you deals. Clients are notoriously quite demanding in the advertising world. Are you just as pushy with them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBkwAS"&gt;I kind of have to be. Sometimes WME gets to be the bad guy. But I like to keep it very short and sweet. I think I tweeted a couple of weeks ago how many emails I get that are just like, “Hey, this is us. We’ve got this idea. When can we hop on a call?” But I don’t really want to do that. If you can’t get your idea down in a couple sentences in an email, it’s probably not a good enough idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfJDIp"&gt;Maybe that’s harsh, but we have to be very efficient with this stuff. We say no to 99 percent of the things that we get offered to do. But that last 1 percent of things, we think very deeply about, and work with a lot of people to try to make the right decisions and pull it off well. So that might turn into merch, that might turn into &lt;em&gt;Retro Tech&lt;/em&gt;, that might turn into any number of interviews we do or projects on the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5wops"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your revenue split, in a general sense, between AdSense, sponsored integrations, merch, and the other stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkkM8H"&gt;Revenue is probably about 40 percent from YouTube AdSense, strictly those ads that get placed. Probably 50 percent sponsored integrations that we build into the channel and the videos. And the last 10 percent is miscellaneous. That includes the merch, that includes licensing, that includes random other appearance fees. Sometimes I’ll hop on another show. Stuff like that. It’s mostly those two big buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdQw8S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you think about growing your revenue, you’re hiring people, you use fancy cameras — you got Red cameras. I think we’re all jealous of your cameras. Those are costs. How do you think about growing your costs versus your revenue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpCkYk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think, “I want to buy this camera and I have to make 10 videos to pay it off?” I’m assuming it’s more sophisticated than that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehf4Td"&gt;It used to be kind of like that. And luckily our output versus our costs is phenomenally efficient. It used to just be me and a camera. I didn’t have a studio, I didn’t have a team, I didn’t have employees. It was literally just me doing it in my spare time, after a college class. So, my expenses were food and more gear, and my cleats for that weekend. I didn’t really have a process back then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAstKW"&gt;Today, it’s a little more of a balancing act. So now we do have the overhead of the studio. Taxes might be my biggest expense, honestly. But we have equipment to buy. And again, it’s not even necessary equipment, but what will help a project? What will help this team work well? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQLsyo"&gt;We don’t think of revenue on a per-project basis, but I imagine it more on a monthly input / output, where if we, say, don’t do any sponsored integrations for a month and just have this much AdSense coming in, what’s the difference between that and how much we’re going to have to pay for salaries and studio and equipment? And if we can spend that, great. If we can put it back into videos, even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmDhZA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, if you’re not cost per project, which makes sense. The standard TV network executive way of thinking about cost is cost per minute of video. That’s how a TV show would get its costs measured versus revenue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umtAVL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that more of where you’re at? We’ve made 100 videos, it costs this much to make, we made this much money, we’re ahead for the month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9xaI"&gt;I don’t know about per minute. I think it’s still pretty broad on a per month, per quarter basis. Quarter one, we will probably not have nearly as much room to work with and put back into videos as quarter three or four. But none of it is ever so negative to the point where I have to think hard about it and make business decisions based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SndP1m"&gt;Now this might change, because we’re hiring a bunch of people and we’re thinking about building the space up. This might eventually be a thing where we need the money back. But at the moment, we haven’t had to think too hard about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEyJMA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, one thing that’s really interesting is, you don’t have a slot. A TV network executive thinks in 30-minute increments. So once you have that fixed through the day and you’ve got a bunch of producers competing for those slots, you can see how they ended up at cost per minute, right? And you just end up there through the run of the day. You have, effectively, infinite slots on your own little network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nln90K"&gt;Right. But the thing about those slots is, their value changes way more fluently and on different factors. The cost of an ad spot on the channel has changed over time, based on the things like the sentiment of the channel or the channel growing. Or even what that video is about. If it’s a positive or a negative video, how tied in is that integration to the video itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mlhlya"&gt;There’s a lot of science, more than math, that goes into how much an ad spot is worth. In a TV world you can know how many people you can get or how many you can pay for. I think that’s really different from YouTube where like, how closely can we work with this company? How good of a thing are we enabling? What can we actually make? Those are different questions that don’t necessarily get asked as much in that TV environment, that I think touch everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVktUU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This kind of gets into one thing that I personally was very happy to see on your channel. You made an entire video about your ethics policy and what you will and won’t do with advertisers. Just to draw the stark contrast, I have almost nothing to do with the revenue of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I’m a very traditional journalist in that mold. Like, I know who our sales team is and sometimes they parade me out in front of executives to seem fancy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOMBin"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I don’t know what our rates are. I’m very insulated from sales. It’s your inbox, it’s your deals, you’re setting the rates. How do you balance that tension, because it’s a very YouTube-specific tension in one way, but I think we’re seeing it across the entire kind of creator ecosystem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZzyVh"&gt;The way you phrase it is interesting. I think our rates for an ad in a video are pretty fluent. But it’s a balancing act, because you don’t want to overdo it or pick the wrong thing or not consider some part of this that should be considered. You want to make more, so that you can pay for that camera car. But the other end of that seesaw is a channel that does way too many ads. It comes down to what I would want to watch. When I’m watching a YouTube video and there’s three mid-rolls, that feels a lot worse than zero or one mid-roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="009qbM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, wait, wait. You don’t pay for YouTube Red? Come on, man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHmLSx"&gt;Well, I do. But like I said, I have to consider that. If I didn’t have it, I would really dislike three mid-rolls. So, despite having YouTube Red, I never put three mid-rolls in a video. It’s zero or maybe one. That applies to the ads that we build in and make ourselves, too. If it’s a bad product, it’s not worth doing it at all, even if we would’ve made a ton of money. If it’s a bad integration or if it’s a bad company to work with, I have to say no, because it just doesn’t fit. So that fit is often more important than the math of the per-minute or per-project basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHjYap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said Dbrand was great because it was adjacent, but it’s not something you review. Have you done deals with companies whose products you review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyReN3"&gt;I’ve done deals with companies whose other products I’ve reviewed, but I’ve never done a review that is sponsored. And the closest I’ve ever come is doing a sponsored video of a Lenovo laptop, where I didn’t review it, but I’ve reviewed Motorola phones in the past and Lenovo owns Motorola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBWigO"&gt;So it’s tech stuff, but once I do a sponsored bit with that tech, I’m not reviewing it. I’ve even seen channels where they can review that thing, but they can also disclose their relationship and past sponsor projects with them. I have a couple of friends that have their entire channel sponsored by a company and review all of that company’s products. As long as the audience knows about it, it’s fine. So everyone draws their line in the sand in a different place. But for me, I’ve never reviewed a thing and done a sponsorship with that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8bmn5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have an ongoing relationship with Motorola, you get their next phone, and you’re like, “This is a bad phone. I’m going to give it a bad review.” Do you consider the negative commercial implication of that bad review on your sponsorship business going forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yi5boI"&gt;That’s one of the most interesting, weird areas on YouTube. I didn’t realize that people thought that way until it started happening to other people. So I’ve given lots of bad reviews in the past to things I really don’t like, and that has never had any effect on my relationship with the company that made that thing. At least as far as I know, maybe internally they’re all raging at their screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InktL7"&gt;But the access to the product, the way the review program works, none of that has ever changed. I don’t think I’m blacklisted from anywhere. But I don’t think that is necessarily true for every channel of every size. So that’s a decision that others have to deal with more than I do. For me, if a Motorola product comes out and it’s bad, the most important thing for me to say is exactly how bad it is so you can make your decision, but also so that you know I’m telling the truth and that I’m honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvE1N0"&gt;There’s a lot of stuff we’ve given negative reviews and then the next product that comes out from that company, they are twice as eager to get it in my hands because, “Look, we improved the thing that you talked about, you definitely want to see this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUCpl6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s our experience, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is big now, but it used to be small and we used to feel that pressure. One thing that’s really interesting as we’ve gotten bigger — I’m curious for your read on it — is the pressure has gone away and it’s expressed in a different way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI9Hjs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s expressed how you’re describing. They fix the one thing you complained about. So now they definitely want the positive review this time. Did that change for you as you got bigger? Or was it always the same because you were on that early curve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Niu3jf"&gt;I think the more I think about it, it’s definitely shifted a little bit. I guess maybe it’s part of the way I structure reviews, but there’s always some sort of an overarching theme or you get a motif or something that’s repetitive through the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuDwe0"&gt;So even if there are only three or four bad things about that product, if they’re all bad for the same reason, that just sort of lingers after you watch the video, that this product is bad for this overarching reason, not just the one little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Kp5x"&gt;A lot of times they’ll fix one little thing, but the other parts of that overarching bad review are still there. You find yourself trying to give credit where it’s due: “Look, they did fix the thing,” but also, “Here’s the big picture.” You have to paint the whole picture for everybody every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH1YNq"&gt;I just try to stay as honest as possible. Sometimes you do see companies sort of change their relationship with a publication for a negative review or a video they didn’t appreciate. I hate seeing that and I hope we stop seeing that. It’s a really strange environment that I haven’t had to deal with, luckily, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDkEEg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about yourself? I mean, you describe yourself as a YouTuber a lot. It’s very clear I’m a journalist, and I get all the baggage of saying that word and I get some of the benefit. Do you think of yourself as a journalist? Are you a creator? Are you an influencer? What is your category, do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjPzwW"&gt;Well, there’s some weird words in there. It really depends on who I’m explaining this to. For most younger people I can say YouTuber and they’ll get it. To most older people or maybe people in business, I don’t say YouTuber very much. I also hate the word influencer. I feel like we all hate that word. So I think the word creator applies best to cover what’s happening, but it’s a little more broad and it comes with the baggage of having to explain what that is and then, the “how do you make money doing that” questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqhLuG"&gt;But I think my most common answer, if I’m on a flight, or someone’s just like, “Hey, what do you do?” I say video producer, and usually that is the end of the line of questioning. Basically, I’m trying to end the conversation. So if I say tech reviewer, which I am, that is a job that I do, it’s not usually very well understood. I don’t know if I would say journalist, I think that’s often in a different medium. So I think creator. Creator is probably the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5NBfv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s interesting. Our group of reporters who cover the platforms, we call them the creators desk. We feel like we understand what that word means. Jake, our editor of the creators desk, his line for what they cover is how people use platforms and how platforms use people. It feels like a complete idea. But yeah, we take that out in the world, and we’re like, “We cover creators,” and no one knows what we’re talking about. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2lwVe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I want to push on not calling yourself a tech reviewer. You said that’s just one of your jobs. You did put out a video about your ethics policy. Like you have some claim to doing the journalistic work of traditional reviews, but you don’t think that encapsulates your entire role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZyve2"&gt;I think when I break it down, it’s really two distinctly separate jobs that have to connect and talk to each other. I would say one is the reviewer part of it, where you have an ethics policy, or you have your standards. That’s one job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnBRIc"&gt;The other job is the content strategy, the YouTube growth strategy. There’s other words I’ve used for this before, but that whole creator side of it, which includes all of the stuff that goes into making a YouTube channel and building a video channel is a very distinctly different job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjnWGg"&gt;So when I describe who I am or what I do, it feels like I’m picking between those things. If I’m a creator, I guess that’s more leaning into the YouTube side of it. But if I’m a tech reviewer, that’s obviously leaning hard into the other side. So I don’t know if there’s any one word that fully explains everything that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8orLe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about YouTube. You said AdSense is 40 percent, sponsor integration is 50; that means YouTube is 90 percent of your money. What is your relationship with YouTube like? I mean, you’ve seen the whole platform come up. It goes through its periods of scandal and then relative calm and then scandal again. How beholden to YouTube do you feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Yjgb"&gt;That is a great question. I feel strangely very beholden, but also not at all. It’s hard to explain. Basically, the audience follows the character MKBHD in a variety of ways, on different platforms, whether it’s Twitter, or Instagram, or TikTok. All of those platforms have different formats and different reasons to follow them, and that’s by design. Some people post the same thing everywhere and that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G14Cdt"&gt;So I feel like if you removed one of those channels, the MKBHD character or brand would continue to live on, but the money, like you said, mostly comes from one of those platforms. So the smart, business-savvy professional that I claim to be, who went to business school, is diversifying streams of income that aren’t entirely dependent on one platform. That’s something we are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYgXLq"&gt;I’ve had a lot of conversations in the past year or two working directly with companies — and not in an advisory role, but almost helping out with products and launches and things that I think are a good idea. And they’re not even in the tech space, they’re just all other things I’m interested in and that’s been really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIdC2k"&gt;But my relationship with YouTube is great. It’s a very turbulent environment to be on for a lot of channels, but not for me. Not for a tech YouTuber who doesn’t curse and doesn’t do anything crazy or talk about conspiracies. It’s been very reliable and that’s definitely a luxury, but there’s a whole part of my brain that’s dedicated to building this thing beyond just one or two platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJGFPZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was talking to Taylor Lorenz at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The [New York] Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about TikTok stars and how that universe is growing. She said, “Every TikToker wants to be a YouTuber.” YouTube is the gold standard. It’s the most mature platform, it’s got the most monetization options, it has the widest range of potential formats, it’s the most stable company, it’s Google. You’re on the gold standard. Where’s the place you want to go next? Is it build out the Instagram revenue stream? Is it be a TikToker, or do you not think of it that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtBfz4"&gt;The way I think about it is, right now, if I’m going to contribute, I go back to the beginning. I’m contributing to this wealth of information about a product so you can make a purchase decision. That’s the fundamental thing that I’m doing. If the answer to the question, “Where should I go to find this information?” ever changes from, “Let me just go look it up on YouTube,” then I’ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cublUt"&gt;Other platforms, I think, have a distinct advantage in other things. Like if I wanted to make a Netflix series, that wouldn’t be me reviewing things, that would be very different. But I think the bread and butter of what we do is reviewing things and YouTube is the place people go for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxizDW"&gt;I’m constantly looking at the way this landscape changes and new platforms bubble up and disappear. I keep my eye on that stuff, but I don’t see the answer to that question changing very quickly or drastically for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXtJGD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I always remind people that Google is the world’s number one search engine and YouTube is the world’s second biggest search engine. For that thing you’re talking about, I need to type in, “iPhone review.” There are two boxes people are going to type that into, and you need to win at one of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Lekh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked about not being controversial on YouTube, and not going through this turbulent time. You did make a video about Black Lives Matter. You have tried to change your audience over time and be a little bit more expansive. How did that video do — were you just called to do it, or do you want to use your platform to accomplish other goals as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xozY2m"&gt;I think a lot about what I use this platform for, because it wasn’t always a platform. But we’ve built a subscriber base over time, and I’ve distinctly never really used my platform to do anything other than the tech world stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJDXZk"&gt;And I think that over time I’ve realized that I do want to do more with the platform, whether that’s giving back to charities or giving back to organizations I’ve been a part of in the past that have built me up to where I’m at today. Sometimes that’s speaking out about injustice in this country. I think a lot of that sort of has bubbled up and I’ve realized that I do actually have a platform to speak out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OukSt"&gt;But I’ve also personally always had a view that I never look up to someone for anything more than the reason that they’re looked up to. So for example, Michael Jordan, the basketball player. I know celebrity culture is different in everyone’s heads, but I look up to Michael Jordan the athlete and nothing else about him. You might look up to Marques the YouTuber or the tech reviewer, but ideally nothing else about me is on your radar as far as celebrity culture goes. I realize not everyone thinks that way. So I try to make the best of it and use my platform for positive work rather than negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6wPBS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting because I think that’s how Michael Jordan wanted people to think about him, but that is not how LeBron James wants people to think about him. The internalized conception of celebrity for people with platforms that size has definitely shifted over time. Is that a path that you’re on? You’re like, Marques at 40 is going to be like, “I built a school,” or is that—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdCTBy"&gt;It’s something I’ve realized. Like, I personally have had this one channel. I’m a golfer. I look up to Tiger Woods the golfer—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpHRji"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should not look up to Tiger Woods for any other reason than golf.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH0tRX"&gt;Exactly. So I’ll bring up Tiger all the time as a personal inspiration and there’s all kinds of other reasons why you shouldn’t look up to Tiger. For me personally, I’ve realized that that’s my one-track mind, but I understand that athletes like LeBron have used their platform to accomplish incredible things. I see that as an inspiration and I feel like me realizing that’s more how people see celebrities makes me want to use it for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTSRpo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said reviews are about helping people make a purchase decision, which is how I think about reviews, too. It’s the core service a review provides to the world. If you’re not doing that well, then you might as well not think about doing anything else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHNS45"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I think of it a little bit more expansively because we also cover all the other bits and bobs of Google. I don’t know how to cover the state of Android right now without talking about the fact that Samsung is effectively a monopoly provider of Android phones and Google doesn’t have a lot of competition. Or that Qualcomm is effectively a monopoly provider of chips. There’s a whole antitrust conversation in this world and with a review, I can say, “I added up all this other stuff I know, and your phone is a seven,” right? Or I can weave that all in and say, “Here’s this purchase decision, but there’s this larger set of forces in the world that have led to this product.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2tECC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The example I always give everybody is the answer to “Why does my iPhone drop calls?” Which starts with “The United States government exists,” right? You have to pull it all the way out to spectrum auctions and network capacity. Some of that stuff feels very political when we do it, but it’s necessary to explain some of the products. Do you think that you need to engage on that policy side, which opens you up to a world of political opinion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LwXBK"&gt;That’s part of actually why I’m building the team up this year. We want to cover more stuff. I think the actual breadth of what I talk about has pretty dramatically expanded over time, though it’s still obviously in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3pf3Y"&gt;But if you look back, I started with the HP Pavilion dv7t and my first hundred-something videos were all about software and accessories for that one laptop. Right? But then the iPod comes out and now there’s the iPod Touch and now I’m talking about handhelds. Which led me to the smartphone world and smartphone hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWoF7P"&gt;But there’s also tablets and TVs. I didn’t talk about most of that stuff until the last couple of years, and now there’s electric cars, and now there’s 5G, and it’s all been growing pretty steadily because there’s a lot of stories to tell to help the viewer understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2G7qg"&gt;Part of my goal is to expand that to not just help people make a decision about what to buy, but to help people better understand the tech world, which I think is hard to understand. So it helps to have writing and research help. That is a pretty new goal for me: the idea of helping people better understand what’s happening in the tech world, why it’s happening, whether they should care. Things like that. And hopefully that can help them live their life a bit easier in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UD9w1J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you a hard question. We know that facial recognition systems are often biased against Black and brown people. They literally just don’t see us as well. Do you weave something like that into one of your reviews? Because that’s something &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; team would cover. We have reporters to do that work. And then when Dieter or Becca and I go to make the review on the channel, we just get to say it and put up our own headline, and the work is done. I know for a fact that we have negative sentiment about that stuff. We get comments about that stuff. But that’s the totality of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; brand. Is that a place you would go in your reviews or is that too political, or are you building the capability to be there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVwerH"&gt;A little bit. I have a little bit already, and a lot of that comes from my personal experiences and not as much from research about others’ personal experience. And part of that comes from the reviews mentality where it’s like, I reviewed this thing. Mine didn’t break. Even if someone else’s broke, I didn’t talk about how this thing broke because mine didn’t break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mU6dce"&gt;So I don’t have the extra experience or reporting to know that stuff. But pretty recently in my blind smartphone camera test, I talked about the way these cameras handle taking pictures of people with darker skin. They do different things to faces than they would with someone with fairer skin. I don’t know that I’ve seen any negative reaction to that, but I like the idea of being able to dive deep into others’ experiences with the same thing and loop that into my coverage. But as of right now, for the last 12 years of videos, all of it comes from what happened to me when I use the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeoLa9"&gt;So that would be an interesting new leaf to turn, and I think it would be a good one to start getting into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsEcFE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I hear from YouTubers all the time is, “It’s a grind. This is one of the best jobs you can have, it’s one of the worst jobs you can have. You go a week without making a video, you’ve got less money in your pocket.” You’ve obviously scaled an infrastructure around you in a much more sophisticated way than a lot of YouTubers I talk to. But you’re launching another channel with other faces; do you see yourself 10 years from now making 100 videos a year on your main channel and with a network around you, or are you eventually going to become a media executive and not have to actually make this stuff yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JM56E3"&gt;So my answer to that has always been, as long as I really enjoy making videos, I don’t see myself stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2lonF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you going to keep doing this for 10 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUZIwb"&gt;I will be making a lot of videos in the future, but I think the thing about starting a new channel with new faces is you get to play with different ideas that aren’t necessarily going to land on the main channel. And maybe those turn into projects that end up being a whole lot of fun and become a recurring series. I think the bottom line is, as long as I enjoy making stuff, that’s what I’m going to be trying to do. There’s probably different versions of that in the future, but I like making stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5Hi06"&gt;The way I see YouTube is, it’s kind of like driving for Uber. If you stop driving for Uber for a week, you won’t make any money that week. And I think adding more people to this team makes it feel like putting that Uber on autopilot so I’m not doing quite as much of the lifting, but it still has to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqGTr3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could live in this metaphor with you for another hour. There’s a lot in that metaphor, just a lot in that metaphor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSfbpz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me pull you all the way back to the beginning. So you’re a teenager again, you picked a popular laptop. You got lucky. If you picked an unpopular laptop, I don’t know that you’d have this career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1cEVf"&gt;That’s a good point, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="810Zx1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you get your laptop right now, you get a new MacBook Air M1, and you’re 17 years old. And you’re like, “I found something about this laptop that I didn’t see on anybody else.” Where would you make your first video?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpElyQ"&gt;Maybe it’s out of force of habit, but just because it’s my gut reaction. I would make it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2wrew"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’d still be a YouTuber?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ROkV9"&gt;I would still be a YouTuber. Obviously, there’s a ton of platforms available today that all have different languages, and if I’m 17, maybe I go straight to TikTok. Maybe there’s a seven-second bit that I just want to show and maybe that’s the way to get the message out there. But I think my fundamental beginning decision was, people are going to be looking for this. It’s not so much passive entertainment. It’s more active, seeking out information. So I’m going to put it where people can find it. And for me, that’s still YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTxkYp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sure teenagers ask you this all the time, but do you still see YouTube as a viable career path? Can you still start at the bottom and make your way to the top?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBTzcd"&gt;That is actually one of the toughest questions, because I struggle to give any advice to people starting today, because I started in a very different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ouijwV"&gt;Ninety percent of the kids you ask, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” They’re like, “Well, yeah, I want to be a YouTuber.” They know what the world is. They know how that works. They’re familiar with it. But like I said, it’s so saturated and it’s so difficult to stand out, but at the same time, it’s never been easier to start. So if you are cool with starting and making 100 videos and never making a dime, and it’s just fun, that’s never been easier. So I’d say, do that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Pro Tools proficiency’ may be keeping us from diversifying audio </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TZH3aU"&gt;It’s been nearly eight years since Radiotopia executive producer Julie Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/why-are-70-percent-of-the-most-popular-podcasts-hosted-by-men"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that 70 percent of the most popular podcasts were hosted by men. It’s been six years since journalist and audio editor Charley Locke argued that podcasting’s biggest problem &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/08/podcast-discovery-vs-diversity/"&gt;isn’t discovery but diversity&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s approaching three years since podcast producer Phoebe Wang’s infamous &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ThirdCoastFest/the-2018-third-coast-awards-ceremony-acceptance-speeches-featuring-a-transcript-of-phoebe-wangs-e22f293e73a7"&gt;Third Coast call out&lt;/a&gt; of audio companies’ lack of diversity, which led, in part, to the &lt;a href="https://pocinaudio.com/"&gt;POC in Audio&lt;/a&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgUJ6G"&gt;Despite the no-doubt earnest efforts of many well-meaning individuals, podcasting, it would seem, has had — and continues to have — a diversity problem. And while there are many factors which contribute to maintaining the industry’s status quo, there is one culprit to which we can confidently point: Pro Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wPvIYW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;a manager at an npr show I really wanted to work at earlier in my career told me not knowing ProTools was why he couldn’t hire me. So I quit my day job to do an unpaid training program at a tiny/wonderful radio station, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KALW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kalw&lt;/a&gt;. that’s how I learned. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RFPbISa7lT"&gt;https://t.co/RFPbISa7lT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— lina misitzis (@lmisitzis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lmisitzis/status/1344772204672651264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsYJcn"&gt;Pro Tools, made by Avid, is a monstrous digital audio workstation (DAW) software. Using Pro Tools, it is possible to do almost anything in audio, even though “almost anything” is seldom necessary for all but the most immersive, sound design-forward podcasts. Pro Tools offers layer upon layer of features that, for most podcasts, are entirely unnecessary. It is nightmarish in its complexity, has an (arguably) awful user interface, comes with oft-bemoaned customer support, and is prohibitively expensive, even when compared to similar programs like Adobe Audition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhLen2"&gt;How exactly ProTools came to be the production standard in podcasting is a question unto itself, and while a few shops work in the aforementioned Audition, Logic, or Reaper, just about everyone who works in podcasting has at some point had the horrifying realization that Pro Tools is inescapable and they must learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yn3Eyf"&gt;That learning, of course, involves an investment of time and of money (tuition for Berklee Online’s &lt;a href="https://online.berklee.edu/certificates/pro-tools-professional"&gt;Pro Tools certificate&lt;/a&gt;, for example, amounts to nearly $6,000). The people who have the opportunity to learn Pro Tools have historically often been those who have the ability to work for free in unpaid internships or have the economic ability to pay for either tutoring or actual programs to learn the software. Yet, if you were to peruse entry-level and / or associate producer job postings, you would find that a majority require at least Pro Tools proficiency, if not “wizardry” (sly is &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which has adopted the astonishingly vague “&lt;a href="https://nytimes.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NYT/job/New-York-NY/Associate-Producer%E2%80%94Opinion-Audio_REQ-008694-1"&gt;fluency&lt;/a&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5jl33i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i don’t know protools, and cool-kid podcast shops all insist on it/look down on audition, so i have some impostor syndrome about that. it’s just so EXPENSIVE; it’s hard to justify downloading it just to play around when i already have audition. &lt;a href="https://t.co/paEr6HMlPa"&gt;https://t.co/paEr6HMlPa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— adwoa gyimah-brempong (@theonlyadwoa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theonlyadwoa/status/1344836091799506946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UWUrGO"&gt;I asked Shannon Lin, a podcast producer at the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, to expand on her tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiwre3"&gt;“I recognize that Pro Tools is the industry standard and I think it’s reasonable to expect senior-level producers to have Pro Tools experience,” Lin said. “I also think employers should be willing to train people, especially if they have experience with other audio editing software, like Audition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4THGC"&gt;“In my experience, producers of color historically haven’t been given the same opportunities (like working in larger shops that have access to more resources like Pro Tools), and their resumes reflect that,” Lin continued. “Investing in POC reporters/producers by providing them with an environment where they receive training is vital to diversifying newsrooms. Everyone is ‘green’ until they’ve been given an opportunity to prove themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CQC579"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think our industry has needed to do better for a long time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwu2Mr"&gt;It’s the classic chicken-before-the-egg sort of problem — how to obtain skills which ought to be learned on the job in order to be considered for the job in the first place — and one with a predictable effect. “I think our industry has needed to do better for a long time, whether that’s public radio, podcasting, or anywhere in between,” said Julia Furlan, host of &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;’s podcast &lt;em&gt;Go For Broke&lt;/em&gt; and an adjunct professor at The New School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3hNZ6"&gt;“First of all, Pro Tools is software that is not made for [podcasters] in the first place: it has all kinds of bells and whistles on it that podcast producers don’t necessarily need. It’s already an adaptive technology, in that [we’re] using something that’s mainly for professional musicians. Second of all, I think Pro Tools can be used as a gate-keeping technique, which says to people that if you don’t know this specific software that costs a lot of money and is extremely complicated, then you can’t be a part of our industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zDnsaU"&gt;It’s not ideal, but is it illegal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L62otW"&gt;In short, it’s complicated. Such gatekeeping, whether intentional or not, may be illegal if used to discriminate against potential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CoDPh"&gt;To learn more, I spoke with Aaron Konopasky, a senior attorney at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a federal agency responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, transgender status, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egxWjL"&gt;“If there’s anybody out there who is requiring Pro Tools or anything else because it excludes a particular group disproportionately, that would be discriminatory,” explained Konopasky. “[But] when it comes to inadvertent discrimination, it’s a little more complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtgtOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s also about who was discouraged from applying in the first place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d2UXVM"&gt;“Let’s pretend we’re in a court case. The first step would be to try to prove ‘&lt;a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/disparateimpactdisparatetreatment.aspx"&gt;disparate impact&lt;/a&gt;.’ If disparate impact&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; shown, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s illegal, because the employer has the opportunity to show that there is a business justification for the practice,” Konopasky said. “A business hiring people to process fish, for example: suppose they require a bachelor’s degree. Do you really need a bachelor’s degree to put fish into a can?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bps4P3"&gt;Podcasting might not have much in common with putting fish into a can, but requiring Pro Tools proficiency when hiring an associate producer isn’t so far removed from demanding a bachelor’s degree for that coveted position in a fish-processing house. However, even if there is a business justification for a hiring practice, an employer could still be asked whether there was something else it could have done — or if another platform could have been utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD5ccR"&gt;“That’s often where the more difficult evaluations take place. One relevant consideration would be, is Pro Tools the platform that the business runs on? If it is, that might be evidence in favor of the requirement being job-related,” Konopasky said. “But if they’re really using it as a proxy for general competence, or how smart are you, or how long have you been in the business, is there some other criterion they could use that would be just as good that wouldn’t have the same impact? That’s the question you would have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kJwwO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to not only focus on hiring widely and hiring diversely, but also on training practices and editorial practices.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2NELE9"&gt;While Konopasky emphasized that he couldn’t give legal advice, he indicated that requiring Pro Tools proficiency did seem dubious — given its high cost, for one, as well as the existence of numerous equivalent options, from Audition, to Logic, to Reaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6aySv"&gt;Toward the end of our conversation, Konopasky pointed to something truly disconcerting: establishing whether a hiring practice is discriminatory isn’t only about taking into account those who applied and weren’t hired, but &lt;em&gt;those who were discouraged from applying in the first place&lt;/em&gt; because of the requirement — those who, perhaps, never applied at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQTJgl"&gt;Hiring practices have implications, and ultimately, there’s an undeniable relationship between the diversity problem in podcasting and the type of audio that gets made. If podcast companies are serious about diversifying the industry, it’s time to thoughtfully consider less evident barriers to entry. Unpaid internships, once ubiquitous, have become nearly indefensible; requiring expertise in expensive and complex programs for entry-level roles, expertise which may be gained on the job, ought to be next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86BGWU"&gt;“If we want to change our industry, we have to not only focus on hiring widely and hiring diversely, but also on training practices and editorial practices,” said Furlan. “You can’t just hire somebody and then not invest in them, and then say, ‘Oh, it didn’t really work out.’ If you have the budget to hire someone, you should think about what you’re giving them as well as what they’re giving to you. Every hiring decision is a two-way street.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUnuMU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Phrase it in terms of [what you expect them to produce], rather than, ‘You have to use this particular tool.’” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4KwHR0"&gt;If you’re a thoughtful, conscious employer committed to diversity in podcasting — an employer who has the ability and the budget to train and to nurture new hires who come to you with a variety of skill sets — it’s incumbent upon you to reevaluate hiring practices that may include requiring Pro Tools proficiency, or wizardry, or fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN3qZC"&gt;“When employers are thinking about job requirements, a good way of trying to avoid troublesome requirements is to think in terms of what people have to achieve rather than how they achieve it,” Konopasky said. “If you’re hiring somebody, what do you expect them to produce or to give you? Phrase it in terms of that, rather than, ‘You have to use this particular tool.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2ulhF"&gt;Individuals, too, have the ability to act. Those of us who touch the hiring process can write — or advocate for — job descriptions designed to include rather than exclude, and, if need be, to sideline a recalcitrant HR department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="elccI9"&gt;A fantastic candidate, and in particular someone applying for that first job in audio whose voice we so desperately need to hear, ought never to be excluded from the industry due to their lack of Pro Tools proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="B1E8ac"&gt;
&lt;p id="nayyG5"&gt;This story first appeared in &lt;a href="https://bellocollective.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bello Collective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a publication and newsletter about podcasts and the audio industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In WandaVision’s third episode, the devil really is in the details</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P32PBS7OONcQN2R-G_lxA9xwIYs=/464x0:3266x1868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704732/wandavision_pregnant.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5pgQca"&gt;It’s just a jump to the left and a step to the right for Wanda and Vision, who have time warped from the ‘50s and ‘60s to the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL0AHq"&gt;The third episode picks up right &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232745/wandavision-episode-one-two-recap-theory-sword-shield-age-of-ultron-skrulls"&gt;where the last ended&lt;/a&gt;: Wanda is pregnant, but she and Vision are still trying to figure out how they ended up in their perfect suburban life together with no past memories. It’s a wackier installment than the first two episodes, but it’s also key to piecing together what might play out over the next six weeks — including what it could possibly mean for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21059975/doctor-strange-scott-derrickson-multiverse-madness-disney-plus-marvel-loki-wandavision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fucjw"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;With that said, here is your spoiler alert for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s third episode.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU97nu"&gt;If the beginning of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s third episode sets up that something isn’t right, as Vision tells Wanda when they realize how quickly she’s running through her pregnancy, it’s the end of the episode that hammers that point home. The arrival of twin boys, a reference to &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;, a necklace, and a security base just outside of Wanda’s fictional world all provide some clues as to where the series may take us, and which comics it’s pulling from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrIA71"&gt;Let’s start with Monica Rambeau. She’s an agent of S.W.O.R.D., the intelligence agency that was hinted at in the first episode, but her appearance in the episode brings more questions than answers. Is Monica watching over Wanda to ensure the Scarlet Witch doesn’t destroy reality while trapped in her own prism? Or is she trying to help Wanda escape the fake world she’s created for herself? Possibly both! Even though Wanda doesn’t recognize her, it’s Monica who helps deliver her twin boys — Tommy and Billy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XFo1HN6ak2PBHP9UZPWis0eMyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251184/monica_ep3.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IP2blu"&gt;This is pretty important. Thomas and William Maximoff were originally introduced in the comics as Wanda and Vision’s children. At least, that’s what Wanda and Vision thought. Tommy and Billy were merely constructs, created via magic using her mutant abilities. In order to give her sons proper souls, Wanda used &lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers_West_Coast_Vol_2_51"&gt;life fragments from a villain named Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, who later devoured the babies to regain control of the fragmented souls embedded in their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hry7A3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Mephisto? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AS42Ib"&gt;For those who may &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLY8SYpH7AU"&gt;not remember &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto is an old Marvel comic book character. In the comics, Mephisto is a demonic devil-of-sorts who has caused trouble for a number of characters, including Doctor Strange, Wanda Maximoff, and even Doctor Doom. His possible appearance could become another crux to all of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and help set up a way for Doctor Strange to appear in the show as Disney executives have previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTwTPO"&gt;After debuting in &lt;em&gt;Vision and the Scarlet Witch &lt;/em&gt;in 1986, it’s not until 1989 and a storyline in &lt;em&gt;West Coast Avengers &lt;/em&gt;that the twins die and our speculation starts.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Mephisto is the person who effectively absorbs Wanda’s fictional children, leaving her in an unbelievable amount of emotional pain. (Actually, the twins were absorbed through a villain named Master Pandemonium, but he was effectively operating under the control of Mephisto, so we’ll skip over the beautiful but often frustrating intricacies of comic book story lines and try to stay on course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vym9jq"&gt;Although we have not seen Mephisto in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, having Tommy and William enter the show at a time when Wanda is creating a fictional universe for herself in a subconscious that people are trying to break through seems to suggest that Mephisto will appear. Which brings us to our next character in this &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;-like layer of intermingling alternate realities: Kathryn Hahn’s Agnes, Wanda’s next-door neighbor. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfcI-jEFnFR25jZgi4NaM5REL3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251186/agnes_wandavision.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="61q02b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Agatha connection &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YKxLqH"&gt;If it seems like Agnes isn’t really an innocent bystander in this situation, that’s because she probably isn’t. In the new episode, Agnes is seen wearing a very particular necklace. It’s similar to the necklace worn by Agatha Harkness in the comics. Harkness is a witch — actually portrayed as one of the original witches in the Salem Witch trials back in 1692. Although she suffers a terrible tragedy, she becomes best known for two things. The first is becoming a protector-of-sorts of Franklin Richards, son of Sue and Reed Richards, members of the Fantastic Four. Longtime fans will know where this is headed, but Agatha Harkness also played a very specific role in Wanda’s life after Mephisto absorbed her twins, and continued to do so long after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1W9Fi"&gt;Following the traumatic absorption of her children in the comics, Wanda has her mind wiped by Harkness in &lt;em&gt;Avengers West Coast&lt;/em&gt;. It’s easier to erase her memory than trying to save the children by removing them from Mephisto. Grim! (Don’t worry, they return in a new form as members of the Young Avengers named Wiccan and Speed). In the comics, however, Harkness also becomes a mentor to Wanda, teaching her to harness her hex powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC5ERt"&gt;My assumption is that Ralph, the husband Agnes keeps referencing in the first two episodes, is actually Mephisto. Remember her line about wanting to make her husband disappear in the second episode while Vision is performing his magic trick? In that same episode, when Wanda and Agnes’ neighbor Bev remarks, “the devil’s in the details,” Agnes jokingly replies, “that’s not the only place he is.” Mephisto is often referred to as the devil within Marvel comics. It could be nothing, but it could also be foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXNM7y"&gt;The bigger speculation is what this is all leading up to. We know that whenever Wanda realizes that’s something out of place, she has the ability to adjust her world to her liking. When she begins talking about her brother Pietro at the end of the episode, which causes Monica to slip up and ask Wanda if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;he was killed by Ultron&lt;/a&gt;, Wanda uses her powers to physically throw Monica out, back into the real world, onto S.W.O.R.D.’s base. Earlier I asked if Monica is keeping an eye on a dangerous Wanda or trying to help. It seems like Wanda is trapped inside her own subconscious, where Mephisto wants her to be, until the children start to show mutant abilities. Then, he can absorb them and their powers. Mephisto could be controlling Wanda within her own universe by letting her play out the fantasy life she wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2Quqx"&gt;Again, this is Marvel. Specifically, this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The show may be a self-contained story, but it’s playing into the bigger picture. This time around, the bigger picture is...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Doctor Strange promotional image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muLnpojC6RhAhPQsgPf9AAO4jtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7362267/DoctorStrange57fe7b87c8953-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wa1tbt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...folks, it’s Doctor Strange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2kRLPx"&gt;Look, not everything has to build up to Doctor Strange, but at this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, things are building up to a multiverse centered around Doctor Strange. Mephisto and Doctor Strange have had multiple encounters in the comics and have played around with the multiverse narrative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWtQwK"&gt;Plus, at one point in the comics, Doctor Strange literally steps into a version of hell to save the Fantastic Four from Mephisto — so if that’s not everything coming together nicely for Marvel’s next phase, I don’t know what is. I mean, one of Mephisto’s most famous storylines involves Peter Parker, and we know &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; is connected to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 3 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/spider-man-3-and-doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-are-linked-marvel-confirms/"&gt;thanks to Kevin Feige’s recent confirmation&lt;/a&gt;. Mephisto could be part of the connective tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnVJKm"&gt;There’s still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know how Jimmy Woo or Darcy Lewis play into the story, although I’m operating under the assumption that Woo is an agent of S.W.O.R.D. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;following the events of &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know what Monica’s main job is, and we don’t know what happened to Vision’s body — if anything — after &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. What we do know, however, is that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is setting up something bigger than Wanda’s never-ending dream. Marvel’s DNA is finally starting to poke through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDNGzE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXqPGd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It sure sounds like Valve’s Gabe Newell is having a lovely time in New Zealand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DiSw6rpsFG-UvvK8EJjY5_m2sXI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704702/msedge_84yAbbDhzQ.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newell during a rare interview.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/realistic-possibility-48m-e-sports-tournament-could-held-in-nz-says-gaming-tycoon-gabe-newell" target="_blank"&gt;1 News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJ6zwM"&gt;Valve co-founder and president Gabe Newell has given one of his famously rare interviews with &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nzs-newest-billionaire-covid-stranded-american-gaming-ceo-gabe-newell-applies-nz-residency"&gt;New Zealand’s &lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he discusses his admiration for the island country, where he recently &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nzs-newest-billionaire-covid-stranded-american-gaming-ceo-gabe-newell-applies-nz-residency"&gt;applied for residency&lt;/a&gt; after having sheltered there during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also used the interview to confirm that Valve does indeed have new games in development (though he declined to offer more details) and addressed rumors that the company plans to set up an office in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft1U5w"&gt;Mostly it just seems like Newell is having an absolutely lovely time living in a country that hasn’t reported any COVID-19 deaths &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00LcE8ERGhs6bgJeLqF28qa0L8WfA%3A1611318379574&amp;amp;ei=a8QKYL_EIszhgAaonLzICQ&amp;amp;q=new+zealand+covid+2021&amp;amp;oq=new+zealand+covid+2021&amp;amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICAAQyQMQxAIyBggAEBYQHjoECAAQRzoHCCMQyQMQJzoKCAAQsQMQFBCHAjoICAAQsQMQgwE6AggAUJc1WOY5YPg6aABwAngAgAFTiAGCA5IBATWYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAECwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_pYndxK_uAhXMMMAKHSgOD5kQ4dUDCA0&amp;amp;uact=5"&gt;since September last year&lt;/a&gt;. He says he’s been attending motorsport races and pursuing an interest in neuroscience, all while Valve employees back in the US have been stuck at home for months on end. Unsurprisingly, although Newell recently &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nzs-newest-billionaire-covid-stranded-american-gaming-ceo-gabe-newell-applies-nz-residency"&gt;denied reports&lt;/a&gt; that Valve is actively planning to set up an office in the country, he says there’s been “strong interest” from the company’s employees to relocate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oyNBef"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s fun to ship games”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1PaKqT"&gt;“There’s a lot of interest at a grass roots level inside of the company to have some people move,” Newell says, adding that New Zealand’s public health infrastructure is now “critically valuable” for a company in the age of a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRbGxh"&gt;“It’s as if there’s a new element that’s been discovered called ‘not-stupidium’, and New Zealand is one of the world’s producers of it — it’s actually something that’s been built by the people of New Zealand,” Newell says, “It’s absolutely, insanely valuable — like, any high-tech company would say our people are going to be a lot more productive in New Zealand than they are going to be in Ireland or Los Angeles or lots of other places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsWadg"&gt;Inevitably, the interview touches on future games for Valve’s &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; franchises. Although Newell declined to offer exact details (“I’ve successfully not spoken about those things for a long time and I hope to continue to not talk about them until they are moot questions.”), he did confirm that the company has games in development. “It’s fun to ship games,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcV01Z"&gt;It might not be much, but it’s reassuring that a studio with such an enviable back catalog of titles still has plans to release more games in the future — not least because Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/22/17267798/valve-acquired-firewatch-studio-campo-santo"&gt;acquired &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt; developer Campo Santo in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, after it teased its impressive-looking follow-up, &lt;em&gt;In the Valley of Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Last year, Valve made its long-awaited return to single-player games with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;excellent VR-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with some employees reporting that its development had got the studio’s “&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interview-valve-on-half-life-after-alyx/"&gt;excitement and creative juices flowing&lt;/a&gt;” to release more games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkAJD5"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/realistic-possibility-48m-e-sports-tournament-could-held-in-nz-says-gaming-tycoon-gabe-newell"&gt;check out the full interview on &lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube finally enables HDR support on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNJG4XePC7TeVOB1Z0Z2iNMetjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704512/vpavic_4275_20201030_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhQ6u0"&gt;YouTube is finally enabling HDR support on Microsoft’s Xbox consoles. The HDR support works across existing Xbox One S / X devices and new consoles like the Xbox Series X and Series S. As long as you have a TV or monitor capable of displaying HDR videos, the YouTube app will now automatically switch to output HDR content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkEDKp"&gt;The YouTube app on Xbox has never supported HDR previously, despite HDR being available on the PlayStation 4 since 2019. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X launched in November without YouTube HDR support, and it’s still not available on the PS5 yet — a step back from what was available on PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDfckptsgp0VBDV3MEAHWAgCrJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22252208/YKzV6qe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The YouTube app on Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nPzokP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-finally-delivers-hdr-on-the-xbox-one-114053690.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; you can confirm that HDR is outputting correctly from the YouTube app on Xbox by enabling the “stats for nerds” panel (see above). A lot of TVs will also display a HDR prompt or switch to a HDR mode when content is played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbCa60"&gt;Now we just need more HDR content to become available on YouTube. Some of the best HDR content on YouTube is still &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tO01J-M3g0U"&gt;test videos&lt;/a&gt; that were uploaded years ago. We’re starting to see more trailers and videos come with HDR options, but the vast majority of creators don’t upload content with HDR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly planning new MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D2gbftf04MsZI6kpThQ1b1Vyc1w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704385/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QUN2SW"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a new design for its MacBook Air that will include the return of MagSafe charging. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MacBook Air may appear later this year or in 2022, and is designed to be thinner and lighter than the existing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yue8s1"&gt;Apple may make the MacBook Air smaller thanks to reduced bezels on the 13-inch screen, and will reportedly include two USB 4 ports on the laptop. Apple is also likely to include the next generation of its ARM-based processors inside this new MacBook Air, after introducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 on the existing MacBook Air in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="magsafe" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fvHcNKNA1whFI0fAzzNQeqq6SN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/920708/2012-01-25magsafe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Umeo"&gt;Apple’s magnetic charging system, MagSafe, is also supposed to return with this MacBook Air redesign. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the updated MagSafe for the MacBook Pro will be similar to the old pill-shaped design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLIGF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also notes that Apple did consider a larger 15-inch version of the MacBook Air, but has scrapped those plans. This new MacBook Air design is reportedly a “higher-end version” of the existing laptop, and Apple is expected to continue selling the M1 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYY9YJ"&gt;Rumors of a new MacBook Air design come just a week after TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;Apple is also planning a major MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; with squared-off sides like the iPad Pro. Apple is also rumored to be bringing back its MagSafe magnetic charging connector to the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charging company EVgo is going public via SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDCLQqPG7ZCHG5C41kZxH3hWjgI=/0x0:5231x3487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704355/B069C1F8_5E6C_495D_8097_017F02BD9DCF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NojFpK"&gt;Another company in the electric vehicle industry is going public by merging with a so-called SPAC, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;. This time, it’s EVgo, one of the leading providers of electric vehicle charging stations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mzQ7B"&gt;The deal is expected to bring in $575 million for EVgo. When it closes, EVgo will become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPTme8"&gt;In something of a poetic twist, the investment fund that’s merging with EVgo to take it public is &lt;a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/david-crane-back-climate-tech-spac"&gt;one started by climate investor David Crane&lt;/a&gt;. Crane was once the CEO of energy company NRG, which helped start EVgo a decade ago. Roughly $230 million of the proceeds will come from Crane’s SPAC (called Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation). The other $400 million is coming from a new, concurrent round funding organized by Crane’s SPAC that includes institutional investors like BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OSVyP"&gt;There has been a mad rush of SPAC mergers in the electric vehicle space across the last seven months as investors looked to capitalize on the momentum created by Tesla’s skyrocketing valuation. EVgo joins the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;Fisker Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;Arrival&lt;/a&gt;, Hyliion, and competitor ChargePoint in going public via the SPAC route. It certainly won’t be the last, either, as startups like Lucid Motors and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/19/22229493/faraday-future-spac-merger-psac-public-ipo-stock"&gt;even Faraday Future are in talks to do the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU9wO"&gt;“What is so heartening to me,” Cathy Zoi, EVgo’s CEO, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview, “[is] the market now has an appetite to support businesses that do what EVgo does.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QslFzM"&gt;EVgo currently operates more than 800 DC fast charging stations across 34 states in the US. Last year it announced a partnership with General Motors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349614/general-motors-evgo-fast-charging-network-investment"&gt;is supposed to triple that number&lt;/a&gt;, while also building out the ability to charge at faster rates comparable to those offered by Tesla’s Supercharger and Volkswagen’s Electrify America networks. It has also partnered with Uber and Lyft to supply chargers for electrified ride-hailing vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ECRF"&gt;Going public won’t change those expansion goals, according to Zoi. “This capital enables us to execute on a business plan and we can continue to do what we do, which is build and operate convenient, reliable fast charging across America as the market moves more quickly to electrify cars,” she said. Zoi also said she believes EVgo can carve out a big position in the commercial space, as more companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;including, most recently, GM&lt;/a&gt; — focus on electrifying trucks and vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77TyUr"&gt;The recent boom in SPAC mergers has been so formidable that some companies are going public despite having any shot at near-term profitability. And while much of the attention may wind up focused on the consumer-facing companies, Crane told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that his team was “wildly successful” in convincing the investors like PIMCO and BlackRock of EVgo’s advantage: making technology that other automakers — big and small — rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrsFF2"&gt;“I don’t think we came across a single investor that expressed even an iota of doubt about the market here. Where the fault line seems to be developing for investors is a lot of them are far more attracted to what Cathy does — which is, as long as [companies make new] plug-in vehicles, Cathy wins,” he said. “There are [investors] that are a little leery about betting on individual automakers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYi3zI"&gt;“Everyone would like to duplicate a Tesla valuation, but they realize that there isn’t going to be [a lot of those],” Crane added. “So a company like EVgo that serves the whole sector is attractive to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX9GAg"&gt;One downside of SPAC mergers is that, since it’s technically an acquisition, the company being acquired faces looser regulatory scrutiny than if they had gone the traditional IPO route. It’s hard to say what kind of problems that can cause just yet, as most of these deals closed recently. But it became an issue with Nikola last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;when accusations of fraud started flying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzzS1R"&gt;Zoi said the difference with EVgo is that it has a product out in the world. “Whether you’re a giant institutional investor or whether you are a person who’s just managing his or her own money, you can actually go and check out an EVgo station, and say this is reliable, convenient,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KlBt"&gt;Crane, meanwhile, emphasized the months-long process that led to acquiring EVgo in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb1Be"&gt;“We were very thorough in our due diligence. And we we asked a lot of questions. We talked to a lot of people. We did a lot of research, he said. “I think people look at myself and my partners and (his SPAC) and say, yeah, you know, we believe that they kicked the tires and there aren’t going to be unhappy surprises here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIUW0N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crane’s SPAC is providing $230 million for EVgo. A previous version of this story misstated that figure. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will reportedly make 3nm processors at expanded Texas plant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYqxYCzg_wtAx1UfLogFwm9-pqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704341/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wM5xLr"&gt;Samsung is considering spending over $10 billion to build an advanced new logic chipmaking plant in Austin, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/samsung-is-said-to-consider-10-billion-texas-chipmaking-plant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The plant may be capable of making processors as advanced as 3nm, and would be Samsung’s third worldwide to use extreme ultraviolet lithography technology in its chip production. If the plans go ahead, construction at the plant could begin this year, with operations commencing as soon as 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1dS0K"&gt;An advanced US-based Samsung fabrication plant could provide Samsung a foothold in getting new contracts from US customers amidst ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. The move would also bring Samsung into closer competition with TSMC, which manufactures chips for Apple, among others, including the 5nm processors found inside Apple’s latest iPhones and Macs. TSMC is also investing in a US-based plant, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;a $12 billion location in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to start making chips by 2024. In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Samsung said it had yet to make a decision about its plans for a new US facility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lO4M7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As part of an attempt to push more into the processor market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smMY95"&gt;Samsung plans to invest $116 billion over the next decade into non-memory chips, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-logic-chips/samsung-plans-116-billion-investment-in-non-memory-chips-to-challenge-tsmc-qualcomm-idUSKCN1S00CV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. Chips produced in Austin are currently thought to be limited to less advanced 14-nanometer process nodes, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-expands-Texas-chip-plant-in-investment-race-with-TSMC"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung hopes to begin offering chips based on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-11-17/samsung-intensifies-chip-wars-with-bet-it-can-catch-tsmc-by-2022"&gt;3nm processor node technology in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. While the South Korean giant’s strength has traditionally been in memory chips, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the market for logic devices like smartphone and computer processors is more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIUwjf"&gt;Samsung’s plans for the plant are reportedly still in their preliminary stages, but some initial steps have already been taken. &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-expands-Texas-chip-plant-in-investment-race-with-TSMC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in December that Samsung had already acquired a 440,000-square-meter plot in Austin, where it’s had a manufacturing presence since the 90s. Last year, city officials began reviewing the company’s request to rezone the land for industrial use. Closing the deal could be dependent on Samsung negotiating controversial tax benefits and subsidies from the Biden administration, though &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports it may also go ahead without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emmQHp"&gt;Samsung already manufactures chips for Qualcomm and Nvidia, and is reportedly close to signing a new deal with Intel. &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/01/133_302906.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung could produce 15,000 graphics chips for Intel starting in the second half of this year at Samsung’s Austin plant. Incoming Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has said outsourcing may be a part of the company’s future, saying that although company plans to continue producing the majority of its chips internally, it may outsource the manufacturing of “certain technologies and products” in 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-stay-mostly-inside-11611274502?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DjZg7"&gt;With its investment, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Samsung is capitalizing on a growing trend for companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to design their own chips and outsource manufacturing to companies like Samsung and TSMC. As well as making chips for others Samsung also produces its own Exynos-branded processors for use in its smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhaP2L"&gt;Samsung still faces a big challenge competing with TSMC, which plans to invest $28 billion this year alone. In contrast, Samsung’s semiconductor business invested $26 billion last year in capital expenditure, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes this was mainly in support of its memory business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvboxb"&gt;The investment could be complicated by the availability of Samsung heir and de facto leader Jay Y. Lee, who was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236716/samsung-lee-jae-yong-prison-bribery-ruling"&gt;ordered back to prison&lt;/a&gt; for two years and six months on bribery charges.&lt;/p&gt;
