  &lt;p id="f2WAHy"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s cutting the price of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G-powered home internet service&lt;/a&gt; by $10, bringing it back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;the $50 price that it charged during its pilot program&lt;/a&gt;. That $50 a month gets you internet with no data cap, speeds that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fplan%3Ficid%3DHEIS_ISW_C_20HMEINTPL_4201BARY4O4BX5HPG23552&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be anywhere from 35 to 115 Mbps, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fgateway&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a router&lt;/a&gt; capable of turning 5G and LTE into Wi-Fi (which you’ll have to return if you ever cancel the contract-free plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0snAV"&gt;T-Mobile is adamant that your bill won't be higher than $50 — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt; it says there’s no installation fees, activation fees, or equipment rental fees. It seems to view this as a kind of apology for all the fees traditional ISPs like Xfinity and Charter have charged. It’s pretty self-congratulatory, but it’s hard to argue that the service seems like a bad deal: I personally pay $80 a month for Comcast, and frequently find myself chafing under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;its data cap&lt;/a&gt; (though I haven’t been buried with fees like T-Mobile implies I should’ve been). If you’re interested you may want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check to make sure your address is eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPQgIk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a flat $50 a month, the service doesn’t seem like a bad deal if you can get it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe7eVk"&gt;Of course, there are still some asterisks. That $50 price is with automatic billing turned on — leaving it off means you’ll pay $55 a month instead. Plus, you are still paying taxes and fees, they’re just built into the price (T-Mobile’s estimates that they account for 3-12 percent of your bill can be found in the fine print). The company also warns that you could have your service slowed down in times of heavy congestion, though some of its executives have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s “unlikely”. And, while there’s no installation fee, that does mean that you have to do it yourself. The company estimates that’ll only take 15 minutes. If you’re seriously considering the service after the price cut, it’s worth giving our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;article explaining some of the potential downsides&lt;/a&gt; a read.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg breaks silence to say the Facebook whistleblower’s claims ‘don’t make any sense’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znRkkzEJTHdrEluqCu7Hvpl5c2Q=/698x183:3497x2049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957278/1231932411.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPrOyu"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg posted a staunch defense of his company in a note to Facebook staffers, saying that recent claims by an ex-employee about the social network’s negative effects on society “don’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApfTy2"&gt;On Tuesday, a former Facebook product manager named Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; about a trove of internal documents she gave to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The focus of the hearing was on Facebook’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt; internal research that showed Instagram can have a negative effect on young people&lt;/a&gt;, but Haugen took the opportunity to also attack the company’s business model and News Feed algorithm. One of her main arguments was that Facebook’s business of selling ads based on engagement leads it to keep users on the service at all costs, even when it knows that the content they’re engaging with is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V0UByh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4Pvvt"&gt;“The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,” Zuckerberg said in the memo, which he also &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;posted on his public Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. “We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don’t know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyrjWh"&gt;Zuckerberg has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;noticeably silent&lt;/a&gt; on Haugen and the internal documents she gave to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; until now. Sunday, the same day she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;revealed her identity&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, he posted a video of him sailing, which lawmakers later pointed to as evidence that he was avoiding scrutiny. The same committee Haugen spoke to called on Zuckerberg to testify, but he didn’t address the request anywhere in his 1,300-word rebuttal. And as with Facebook’s earlier statements, he didn’t address Haugen by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qz4ZN"&gt;He touched on her claim to Congress that a 2018 News Feed change to prioritize what the company calls “Meaningful Social Interactions” actually encouraged the sharing of more hateful and divisive content. Echoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;his statements at the time of the change&lt;/a&gt;, he said it was done to encourage the sharing of more content between friends and family, and that Facebook knew it would lead to decreased engagement. “Is that something a company focused on profits over people would do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf1H2D"&gt;Facebook’s internal research about Instagram’s negative effects on teens—the main topic of Tuesday’s hearing—has particularly stoked anger towards the company and led for calls to publish more research for independent experts to evaluate. In his memo to employees, Zuckerberg said the company would keep doing research and work to make more of it public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2vOJE"&gt;The post appears in full below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sSbg1V"&gt;Hey everyone: it’s been quite a week, and I wanted to share some thoughts with all of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cca6bV"&gt;First, the SEV that took down all our services yesterday was the worst outage we’ve had in years. We’ve spent the past 24 hours debriefing how we can strengthen our systems against this kind of failure. This was also a reminder of how much our work matters to people. The deeper concern with an outage like this isn’t how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXBlK5"&gt;Second, now that today’s testimony is over, I wanted to reflect on the public debate we’re in. I’m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn’t reflect the company we know. We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health. It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives. At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9ei9V"&gt;Many of the claims don’t make any sense. If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place? If we didn’t care about fighting harmful content, then why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this than any other company in our space — even ones larger than us? If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we’re doing? And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKPRH"&gt;At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritize profit over safety and well-being. That’s just not true. For example, one move that has been called into question is when we introduced the Meaningful Social Interactions change to News Feed. This change showed fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family — which we did knowing it would mean people spent less time on Facebook, but that research suggested it was the right thing for people’s well-being. Is that something a company focused on profits over people would do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nq5RRZ"&gt;The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical. We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don’t know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM7hzC"&gt;But of everything published, I’m particularly focused on the questions raised about our work with kids. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on the kinds of experiences I want my kids and others to have online, and it’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gruXeC"&gt;The reality is that young people use technology. Think about how many school-age kids have phones. Rather than ignoring this, technology companies should build experiences that meet their needs while also keeping them safe. We’re deeply committed to doing industry-leading work in this area. A good example of this work is Messenger Kids, which is widely recognized as better and safer than alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPhRyW"&gt;We’ve also worked on bringing this kind of age-appropriate experience with parental controls for Instagram too. But given all the questions about whether this would actually be better for kids, we’ve paused that project to take more time to engage with experts and make sure anything we do would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5wlp"&gt;Like many of you, I found it difficult to read the mischaracterization of the research into how Instagram affects young people. As we wrote in our Newsroom post explaining this: “The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced. In fact, in 11 of 12 areas on the slide referenced by the Journal — including serious areas like loneliness, anxiety, sadness and eating issues — more teenage girls who said they struggled with that issue also said Instagram made those difficult times better rather than worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B87CHv"&gt;But when it comes to young people’s health or well-being, every negative experience matters. It is incredibly sad to think of a young person in a moment of distress who, instead of being comforted, has their experience made worse. We have worked for years on industry-leading efforts to help people in these moments and I’m proud of the work we’ve done. We constantly use our research to improve this work further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWa8LP"&gt;Similar to balancing other social issues, I don’t believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own. That’s why we have advocated for updated internet regulations for several years now. I have testified in Congress multiple times and asked them to update these regulations. I’ve written op-eds outlining the areas of regulation we think are most important related to elections, harmful content, privacy, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92dxhL"&gt;We’re committed to doing the best work we can, but at some level the right body to assess tradeoffs between social equities is our democratically elected Congress. For example, what is the right age for teens to be able to use internet services? How should internet services verify people’s ages? And how should companies balance teens’ privacy while giving parents visibility into their activity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlyRAn"&gt;If we’re going to have an informed conversation about the effects of social media on young people, it’s important to start with a full picture. We’re committed to doing more research ourselves and making more research publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YciIi"&gt;That said, I’m worried about the incentives that are being set here. We have an industry-leading research program so that we can identify important issues and work on them. It’s disheartening to see that work taken out of context and used to construct a false narrative that we don’t care. If we attack organizations making an effort to study their impact on the world, we’re effectively sending the message that it’s safer not to look at all, in case you find something that could be held against you. That’s the conclusion other companies seem to have reached, and I think that leads to a place that would be far worse for society. Even though it might be easier for us to follow that path, we’re going to keep doing research because it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnYsro"&gt;I know it’s frustrating to see the good work we do get mischaracterized, especially for those of you who are making important contributions across safety, integrity, research and product. But I believe that over the long term if we keep trying to do what’s right and delivering experiences that improve people’s lives, it will be better for our community and our business. I’ve asked leaders across the company to do deep dives on our work across many areas over the next few days so you can see everything that we’re doing to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BluobP"&gt;When I reflect on our work, I think about the real impact we have on the world — the people who can now stay in touch with their loved ones, create opportunities to support themselves, and find community. This is why billions of people love our products. I’m proud of everything we do to keep building the best social products in the world and grateful to all of you for the work you do here every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Google files document production demand against one of its biggest public critics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JmCDSpTjU4VGduNWYawQRTJsmK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957063/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BLutbu"&gt;Late Monday night, Google filed for a court order to produce documents from longtime Google critic Luther Lowe, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ongoing federal antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;, US vs. Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxMmEZ"&gt;The motion arises from an apparent breakdown in negotiations between Google and Lowe’s employer, Yelp. Yelp has agreed to document production from a number of its employees, but has resisted on Lowe in particular, leaving Google to ask the court for a subpoena that would compel email archives and other documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yX5Xkc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yelp cannot deny Google the documents it needs to defend itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="du0Vot"&gt;“Yelp’s allegations against Google conceived and advanced by Mr. Lowe, are a central part of the government’s case,” the filing reads. “Now that the very governmental action Yelp advocated for in its communications is underway, Yelp cannot deny Google the documents it needs to defend itself.” The 51 page filing, like many in the antitrust case, contains numerous redactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OntnrT"&gt;As vice president of public policy at Yelp, Lowe has long been a prominent voice pushing for antitrust action against Google, even launching an email newsletter called &lt;a href="https://wordpress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=52562efd9a39dbe9559cb4285&amp;amp;id=e5d8f6ac12"&gt;“This Week In Google Antitrust”&lt;/a&gt; to track support for action against the search giant. In public statements, Lowe has particularly focused on the search neutrality case against Google, alleging that the company uses the power of Google Search to co-opt and overwhelm subject-matter directories like Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUUbQz"&gt;This isn’t the first time Google has used the antitrust proceedings to compel document production from rivals. In July, the company pushed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601166/us-google-antitrust-case-microsoft-document-discovery"&gt;significant new document production from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, after the company shared hundreds of thousands of documents with prosecutors in advance of the case’s filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiPuTg"&gt;Neither Google nor Lowe responded to a request to comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OqX2Be"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21078200-google-motion-to-compel/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="google-motion-to-compel (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>Intel tries to bash Apple again with a terrible ‘social experiment’ ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2HNQ08e7DW7WVFvoBPCvzcT_04=/242x0:2638x1597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956919/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.12.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a59JUa"&gt;I regret to inform you that Intel has again &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp0xzapm-zY"&gt;made a terrible ad&lt;/a&gt; to showcase how absolutely not mad it is about Apple switching to its own processors. This one, called “Breaking the Spell,” follows a classic format — people are put in a room and told about features supposedly coming to MacBooks. Then, after they get all excited, the twist! They were actually being told about Windows computers, powered (of course) by Intel. The folks in the ad (which the fine print says are “real people paid for their time and opinions”) are speechless and then clamor to buy or take the laptops, presumably now that they’ve awoken to the possibilities of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwy2Wj"&gt;It’s an ad format that’s never been great, but the real kicker is that it makes absolutely no sense here — in the intro, Intel claims it’s showing off “new technology” and “innovations” and then proceeds to show people absolutely gobsmacked by tech that is old news by almost any standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6giOD"&gt;If you’re brave, you can give it a watch below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SdEmkz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp0xzapm-zY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPY0gJ"&gt;I know that when it comes to tech news, there can be somewhat of a bubble, with writers and readers thinking that certain things are more well-known to the general public than they are. But really, if you’ve walked into Best Buy’s laptop section at some point in the past decade, you probably would’ve seen some of the things the people in the ad are shell-shocked by: two-in-one laptops that fold to become a tablet have been popular since the early 2010s, Intel’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993690/intel-computer-concept-copper-harbor-tiger-rapids-dual-screen-pc-prototype"&gt;pushing laptops with two screens since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and PC gaming was a thing before the original IBM Personal Computer that popularized the term “PC.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZf8CJgm_dXJdrbWt_bX3cIPuDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903630/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.15.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be fair, secret rooms are always pretty cool (unless they’re serial killer dungeons, I guess).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V1DM9J"&gt;As for Intel’s upgradability argument, I agree. While I understand that Apple building RAM into the same chip as the processor probably has some performance benefit, it does bite that you can’t upgrade — especially when M1 laptops start with a paltry 8GB and carry a $200 charge for the 16GB upgrade. The problem is, though, that there’s a high chance that the Windows laptop this ad inspires you to buy will also have unremovable and non-upgradeable memory. While you can find Windows laptops with swappable RAM or SSDs, nowadays, that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review"&gt;a notable feature&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20895293/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-upgradability-ssd-apple-ifixit"&gt;an expected one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quFHd7"&gt;Perhaps this ad would be at least closer to forgivable if it wasn’t a mashup of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;another series of ads&lt;/a&gt; Intel made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340359/intel-apple-macbook-pro-ad-commercial-justin-long-all-screen"&gt;featuring “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long&lt;/a&gt; (which people hated) and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbjeJ1lxUw"&gt;those Chevy truck commercials&lt;/a&gt; (which people also hated). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WOA_UFCvHOdeCAP6VGSL_YMJ0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903515/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_1.54.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The like to dislike ratio for Intel’s new ad. Lots of people still spellbound, I guess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lct6yFxCO7w5r1CrfgEv24Jdbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903714/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_3.12.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ratio for Intel’s “Justin Gets Real: Having Choices” ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsDzMW"&gt;Wait, actually, yes, it would still suck — because Intel’s bragging about things you can find in laptops with chips from its other competitor, AMD. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;2-in-1s rocking Ryzen chips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;our top gaming laptop for 2021&lt;/a&gt; has both an AMD CPU and a slot to add more RAM. “But what about dual-screen laptops with AMD,” asked probably no one because it’s a niche product category. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zephyrus-Display-Keyboard-GX551QR-XS98/dp/B09F2LM842?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus has you covered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpc5kN"&gt;I don’t want this criticism to come off as being done by a butthurt Apple fan who’s, as one person in the ad put it, “100 percent loyal to Apple.” (Who talks like that?) While I mostly use Apple products, I’m also an unabashed old ThinkPad lover who thinks Intel has a point — if you can look past how condescending and embarrassing this ad campaign is. I do wish Apple gave people more choice and more upgradability with its computers, and I think people should be more willing to give other computing platforms a shot if they fit their needs better. But does an ad full of people acting like they’ve never seen a computer convince anyone of that? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is making live video quality better by removing one feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ul7y1O4h_m2BgMRyiWblv12J5kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956896/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AWfFIW"&gt;Twitter announced Tuesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445415924564176901"&gt;dropping a feature&lt;/a&gt; from its live broadcasts tool, but the company is removing it in service of making your video broadcast quality better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt3cM7"&gt;What’s gone? Now, you aren’t able to invite guests to join you in a broadcast via audio ahead of going live. That feature was added in March 2020. Now, when you go live, your broadcast will just feature you and whoever else happens to be in the frame, though people can still post in the chat or tap to add a heart to interact with you while you’re broadcasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDkQTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As of today we’re removing the option to invite guests when you go live, so we can improve your video broadcast quality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your viewers can still interact with you through chat and hearts. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bymoq55VIy"&gt;https://t.co/bymoq55VIy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445415924564176901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hTSVx"&gt;Although Twitter says the change is intended to improve video quality, it’s also worth noting that Twitter has another feature for shared live audio: its Clubhouse-like Spaces offering. Spaces seem to have caught on more than what Twitter live video used to let you do, so perhaps the company thought it would be redundant to offer both and is focusing on the feature that seems to have more traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4G1bD"&gt;The change also follows another to improve video quality on the platform: in September, it announced that new videos posted to the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692348/twitter-video-quality-less-pixelated"&gt;would be less pixelated&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t noticed a drastic difference yet, but I’ll take any improvement Twitter can make.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It just got much easier to find your lost AirPods Pro or AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiEaheHIUyePl5myAyfcl8nUEuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956595/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ynre3Q"&gt;Apple today released a firmware update for its AirPods Pro and AirPods Max that introduces new options for finding the pricey products if you happen to misplace them. These capabilities were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;promised for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t quite make the launch; thankfully, it didn’t take Apple much longer after that to roll them out. Both &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/05/apple-rolling-out-new-find-my-features-for-airpods-pro-and-airpods-max/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/airpods-firmware-find-my-updates/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on today’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CF4dO"&gt;Using Apple’s Find My app, it was already possible to view the location where your AirPods were last paired with your iPhone or play a sound to make them easier to dig out of the couch cushions. But this new update greatly expands that functionality. Now you can activate Lost Mode and have millions of other iPhones, iPads, and Macs aid in the search should your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max go missing. If they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device, you’ll be alerted to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoGMMd"&gt;Apple has also added an AirTags-like “Find Nearby” user interface for tracking down a set of AirPods Pro or AirPods Max if you know they’re somewhere close. Since there’s no U1 chip inside Apple’s earbuds or headphones, it’s not quite as precise as with an AirTag; you don’t see the arrows pointing you towards them, but the onscreen prompts will show statuses like far, near, or “here” when you’re right near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAYsXz"&gt;Also super helpful: you can now automatically receive a notification if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515"&gt;support page on the Find My network&lt;/a&gt; explains the various features and how they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPau41"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple still doesn’t offer any straightforward way to update AirPods firmware. It just sort of &lt;em&gt;happens &lt;/em&gt;randomly when they’re connected to your iPhone. But you can at least check what version you’ve got to see if you’ve got these latest features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B0cZUY"&gt;Go to Settings on your iPhone or iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBfxAq"&gt;Tap General, then About&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="612SpH"&gt;Choose AirPods, and in there, you should see a “firmware version” field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="giiE1G"&gt;The new update that offers the improved Find My capabilities is version 4A400, so look for that. As for the regular AirPods, they’re still limited to the more basic functionality that was present before. But whenever the long-rumored third-generation AirPods make their debut, hopefully those will also offer the more robust location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa will now let you take longer to ask a question</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJgjZo"&gt;Amazon has added a valuable new feature to Alexa: you can now opt to have more time to finish your statement or question before Alexa responds to you. The feature could be useful if you wish you had a bit longer before Alexa replied to what you were saying, but it’s also a useful accessibility feature, particularly for people with speech impediments who may need more time to say something. If you want to enable this, you can turn it on in the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9BMbG"&gt;The company has also added the ability for Android users to type requests in the Alexa app. This feature might be handy for when you don’t want to use your voice to ask Alexa a question, but it too could be a boon for accessibility. This feature, which was first added to the iOS version of the Alexa app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149147/amazon-text-with-alexa-ios-public-preview-voice-assistant"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is in public preview for users in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149147/amazon-text-with-alexa-ios-public-preview-voice-assistant"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15648472/google-assistant-keyboard-input-announced-io-2017"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; each offer similar functionality for their respective digital assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on a smart fridge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g9EKchMY4L6FLkL9MoQnlKskg8Y=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956487/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSze1o"&gt;Amazon might be working on its own smart fridge, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-building-smart-fridge-that-monitors-your-buying-patterns-2021-10"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Project Pulse," as the project is titled internally, is reportedly being developed by the same Amazon "physical-stores unit" that worked on the company's &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store"&gt;high-tech Amazon Go stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQEctK"&gt;Project Pulse "is designed to track your inventory and purchase habits, predict what you want, and have it delivered," &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; writes. The fridge could also track expiration dates, suggest recipes based on the products in your fridge, and offer an easy way to order more food from an Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yVh5z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon already introduced a microwave — why not a fridge?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYC4hR"&gt;Amazon's foray into fridges has apparently been in the works for at least two years, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, under the leadership of Gopi Prashanth, "a director of computer and artificial intelligence." There's no telling if or when Amazon will introduce the product, but it will likely partner with other manufacturers if it does, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIj0AHUpYrRcMlSLWVXiLsgn8-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19568996/Family_Hub_CES2020_Black__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung, LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung and LG’s smart fridges from CES 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ejcxrT"&gt;Smart fridges aren't a new idea. Samsung and LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046822/samsung-lg-smart-fridge-family-hub-instaview-thinq-ai-ces-2020"&gt;have both offered appliances&lt;/a&gt; that can identify food, connect to digital assistants like Bixby, and in some cases, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10708380/samsung-family-hub-fridge-mastercard-app-groceries-ces-2016"&gt;easily order more groceries&lt;/a&gt;. If it really is working on a fridge, Amazon's value add would be its network of grocery stores and the work already done using computer vision to identify grocery items in Amazon Go convenience stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323421/amazon-dash-cart-smart-grocery-shopping-woodland-hills-store-cashierless"&gt;Dash carts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mygIGK"&gt;Like other product categories &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;the company has barged into&lt;/a&gt; (most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692248/amazon-smart-thermostat-price-ambient-computer-alexa-preorder"&gt;thermostats&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon is also well positioned to undercut its competitors on price and easily integrate another smart home device into its ecosystem after years of development on Alexa. "We don't comment on rumors or speculation," an Amazon spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EFcdJ"&gt;Take this report with a grain of salt, of course. Amazon is big and well-resourced enough to try plenty of things and never release them. Leaks and rumors related to Amazon's product ambitions have also been hit or miss. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691287/amazon-echo-alexa-devices-wall-mounted-soundbar-auto-robot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; predicted&lt;/a&gt; the company wouldn't announce its long-awaited robot at its fall hardware event, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;it ultimately did&lt;/a&gt; — stoking possible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22699916/amazon-astro-home-robot-camera-surveillance-device"&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;, among plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22675512/amazon-astro-robot-emotion-pets-anki-vector"&gt;other reactions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grFNoh"&gt;There's no telling what Amazon will do, but this is the company that surprised everyone with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882140/amazon-basics-microwave-alexa-2018-smart-features-price-release-date"&gt;an Alexa-enabled microwave&lt;/a&gt;, so what's another appliance? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14308352/amazon-echo-refrigerator-reorders-groceries"&gt;We've already asked for it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCU49l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EMlTF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8GmTVs"&gt;Microsoft is launching Windows 11 virtually today, and the company is promising a “first-of-its-kind 6D streaming event,” featuring Allen Stone and Tate McRae. I’m not entirely sure what a “6D musical experience” is, but &lt;a href="https://elevenation.eluv.io/ms"&gt;Microsoft’s website promises&lt;/a&gt; multiple camera views during its stream and even a free Windows 11 NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agat7e"&gt;Microsoft describes its Windows 11 NFT as a “one-of-a-kind cryptographic token that lives in your digital wallet and unlocks valuable experiences and rewards.” Again, I’m not sure what valuable experiences and rewards this will unlock, but we’ll find out at 8PM ET / 5PM PT when the &lt;a href="https://elevenation.eluv.io/ms"&gt;Windows 11 launch stream&lt;/a&gt; goes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="seyDRN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bringing to you the launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; straight from Burj Khalifa tonight! Stay tuned while we reveal the latest features and updates available to you from Windows. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ANr3kPpX6j"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ANr3kPpX6j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft UAE (@MicrosoftUAE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MicrosoftUAE/status/1445072333392207878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="oq17iM"&gt;Windows launch events typically happen in New York City, but Microsoft hasn’t held any in-person events since the pandemic began. Instead, Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/5/22711189/microsoft-windows-11-ice-cream-free-mikey-likes-it-nyc"&gt;giving away free Windows 11 ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, airing commercials on the screens at Times Square, and has even lit up the iconic Burj Khalifa hotel in Dubai with Windows 11 branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nnuHL"&gt;Windows 11 technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709166/microsoft-windows-11-release-download-available"&gt;launched yesterday on October 4th&lt;/a&gt;, as Microsoft started its rollout of the new OS a little early. New devices launch today with Windows 11 preinstalled, and Microsoft expects all existing eligible Windows 10 devices to be offered the free Windows 11 upgrade by mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DplA7l"&gt;EA is making &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; a little bit more accessible across generations. The company &lt;a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Battlefield-Announcements/Cross-Gen-Bundle-Added-to-the-Digital-Standard-Edition-for/m-p/10802679#M525"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the digital Standard Edition of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S now includes the Cross-Gen Bundle, which gives you access to both the PS4 and the PS5 or Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game. Previously, the Cross-Gen Bundle was only available with the more expensive digital Gold and Ultimate editions of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Aj1jO"&gt;It’s important to note that this cross-gen benefit has only been added to the digital Standard Editions for next-gen consoles. If you buy the digital Standard Edition on PS4 or Xbox One, where it is $10 cheaper than it is on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S, you won’t get the Cross-Gen Bundle. The Cross-Gen Bundle is also not an option for any physical copy of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07B6uD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game supports full cross progression&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuRvhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; supports full cross progression, though, so no matter where you play it, as long as you’re playing on profiles that connect to the same EA Account, your progress will carry over. If you’re considering picking up a next-gen console in the future but want to start playing &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on your PS4 or Xbox One before you do, you might want to pick up the next-gen digital Standard Edition so that you have free access to the next-gen version of the game down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nv2ruT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; will be released on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676330/battlefield-2042-release-date-delay"&gt;November 19th&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to try it ahead of launch, EA is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/open-beta?utm_campaign=bf2042_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_tw-open-beta&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=70479&amp;amp;ts=1633462226611"&gt;hosting a beta&lt;/a&gt; that runs from October 6th through the 9th. People who preordered the game or are an EA Play member will be able to play it first, starting on October 6th at 3AM ET. The beta will open up for everyone on October 8th at 3AM ET. More details can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/faq"&gt;this FAQ on EA’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
