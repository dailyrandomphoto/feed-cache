    <title>Lego is making a Sonic Mania-themed set inspired by a fan creation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aNxOurxf6vqQK4x9G89IH7q8omE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767851/Sonic_Mania_Green_Hill_Zone_Concept_Design.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept design for the Sonic-themed set.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qz7pWK"&gt;Lego is announcing a new video game-themed set featuring Sonic the Hedgehog and characters from &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;. (If you could have told six-year-old me that someday there would be a Sonic-themed Lego set, he’d cry tears of joy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woj3ss"&gt;You can get a look at a concept design for the set, which is themed around Sonic’s classic Green Hill Zone stage, at the top of this post. I love how ridiculous Sonic looks in Lego form, and Doctor Eggman’s towering Death Egg Robot is just awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yx11YX"&gt;The concept for the set was submitted to Lego by Viv Grannell, a Sonic fan based in the UK, through the &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/"&gt;Lego Ideas program&lt;/a&gt;. Submissions need to receive 10,000 votes before Lego will consider making them an actual Lego set, so it’s no small feat that Grannell was able to get the necessary support for the idea to become a reality. If you want to see more pictures of the concept, check out Grannell’s page for the project &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/d7fef363-ead4-413e-a3e2-d9aa848e1cee"&gt;on the Lego Ideas site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCEcCs"&gt;Lego says the set is now entering the “product development phase,” so it seems like we might be a ways away from actually being able to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8kB5a"&gt;Last year, Lego dipped its toes into video game crossovers with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt;-themed sets&lt;/a&gt;. Those have an interactive element to them. The Lego Mario figure will play a sound when it is placed in a pipe or when you made it jump on a Goomba, for example. Sadly, it doesn’t seem like Lego Sonic will be able to make any noises, so don’t expect to hear any of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOvzjBW0v8w"&gt;his snarky quips&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe Lego can add those in a future set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft launches Viva, a bet on the future of remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVDaO_DYti9CJZG7P6a7nIBKFYo=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767900/microsoftremotework.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jEk2PZ"&gt;Microsoft Viva is Microsoft’s new push for helping businesses with remote work and a big bet on this new way of life becoming the norm. It’s designed to act as a portal for both employees and businesses to navigate the complexities of working from home. Microsoft is launching Viva today, with parts of the platform rolling out throughout 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dikVhE"&gt;“We have participated in the largest, at scale, remote work experiment the world has seen,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, underlining nearly 11 months of a pandemic that has reshaped how people work, learn, and live. “As the world recovers, there is no going back. Flexibility in when, where, and how we work will be key.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DD9Jfc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aDLjVQZmno?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FGV1R"&gt;Microsoft Viva isn’t an app or even a service but more of a platform for improving remote work and helping businesses adjust to it. While businesses collectively spend billions of dollars each year on employee wellbeing, Microsoft thinks Viva will help in this new digital era of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QuEp"&gt;“We need to stop thinking about work as a place, and start thinking about how to maintain culture, connect employees, and harness human ingenuity in a hybrid world,” says Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365. Spataro was quick to predict early on in the pandemic that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214314/microsoft-teams-usage-coronavirus-pandemic-work-habit-change"&gt;forever change the way we work and learn&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Viva is clearly the result of trends Microsoft has been witnessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTz590"&gt;Designed for this new flexible and digital era of work, Viva integrates into Microsoft Teams and works rather like the intranet of old by collecting essential parts of a business into a central location. Microsoft is splitting Viva up into four specific modules: connections, insights, topics, and learning. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5i6oIGd8BbCRT7i3sV8HvUMlPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280707/Connections_EXP_2_still__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Connections acts as a portal for employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUuYf6"&gt;Connections includes internal communications, or resources like benefits and company policies. It’s also designed to be the portal you’d head to if you just started working at a company and you’ve never even met your co-workers due to pandemic lockdowns. “You can think of it as a gateway to your digital workplace,” explains Spataro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIXC13"&gt;Viva Connections is built on top of Microsoft’s SharePoint technology, and it will include things like company news, town halls, or even employee resource groups and communities. It’s basically a dashboard for connecting with colleagues remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcxYN5lUpqpv2DTGg6wLwP3Si18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280708/Viva_Insights_app_in_Microsoft_Teams.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Insights provides data on work patterns and trends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSv7FS"&gt;Viva Insights feels like the next step in Microsoft’s controversial Productivity Score feature. Microsoft was widely criticized for allowing managers to drill down into data on individual employees through metadata collected from its software and services. The company was forced to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F01%2Four-commitment-to-privacy-in-microsoft-productivity-score%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;make changes to its Productivity Score&lt;/a&gt;, and Viva Insights includes similar data-driven insights for managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG1rUQ"&gt;Microsoft says Viva Insights will include data for managers and leaders to monitor work patterns and trends, but that privacy will be protected. “This means personal insights are visible only to the employee, while insights for managers and leaders are aggregated and de-identified by default to protect individual privacy,” says Spataro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNXWPT"&gt;Viva Learning is Microsoft’s third module in Viva, and like the name implies, it’s about employee learning and development. This is where employers will house training materials, courses, and other content for employee education. This will include content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, and even a business’ own content, alongside training material from third-party providers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAIQ9v9MUdbNMkHMeGPaAio2h4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280709/Learning_resources_in_Microsoft_Viva_Learning.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viva Learning includes all training materials for a business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MfNIMy"&gt;The last module inside Viva is Topics. “Think of Viva topics as a Wikipedia for the organization,” explains Spataro. It uses AI to organize content and automatically surfaces topic cards with documents, videos, and related people. Viva Topics will generate topic cards from apps like Office, Teams, and SharePoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3uS80"&gt;Microsoft Viva is partly launching today. Viva Topics is available now for Microsoft 365 customers, and a public preview of Viva Insights also starts today. Microsoft is also launching a private preview of Viva Learning and plans to announce more additions to Microsoft Viva throughout 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABKaaw"&gt;Microsoft says it’s only just getting started with Microsoft Viva and that it’s designed to be an “open and extensible platform” for partners. Viva also furthers Microsoft’s ambition to put Teams at the center of its strategy for work and to act as a hub into everything the company does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh3VIF"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams’ Together mode feature&lt;/a&gt;, Viva is clearly inspired by the pandemic-era drive toward remote working. While there’s still a debate around how dramatically office jobs will change once the pandemic is over, Microsoft is very much betting that the way we’re working right now is the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’re starting an online class, check to make sure your professor is alive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vpmyQGM5T0EiqBKxU8qLkHjLlA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767842/acastro_210202_4396_posthumousTeaching_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A college student Googled his remote instructor and found an obituary&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="twiT5e"&gt;Three weeks into his online class on art history, Concordia University sophomore Aaron Ansuini had a question about one of the recorded lectures. He combed through Concordia’s portal, but couldn’t find his professor’s contact information. So he Googled his name — François-Marc Gagnon — and found an obituary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmv6QK"&gt;At first, Ansuini thought it might be a coincidence. “I was like ‘That’s weird, he has the same name,’” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; But further Googling revealed a more disturbing truth. In March 2019, over a year prior to the start of Ansuini’s course, Gagnon had passed away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUWkMJ"&gt;“It was weird and very scary,” Ansuini said. When registering for the class, he’d received no indication that Gagnon was teaching posthumously. The &lt;a href="https://www.econcordia.com/my2/CourseOutline/View.aspx?course=realism_abstraction"&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt; named a different professor as the official instructor, but stated that Gagnon would deliver the lectures — an arrangement not uncommon for Concordia classes. All email communication had come, unsigned, from a “do-not-reply” address. For the first three weeks, Ansuini had assumed those emails were from Gagnon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQ3sk"&gt;The revelation has completely changed Ansuini’s class experience. “I don’t really even want to watch the lectures anymore,” he says. Participating makes him sad; he tries to space the lectures out between other classes so he can take breaks. “It doesn’t feel like a class. It feels like one of those websites, like a Skillshare.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYp86M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It doesn’t feel like a class”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoknU"&gt;The past year has been a trial-and-error process for Ansuini and &lt;a href="https://www.qualityinfo.org/-/growth-in-distance-learning-outpaces-total-enrollment-growth"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of other college students around the world who are taking classes online amid COVID-19, as their schools navigate a new remote curriculum. While online education existed long before the novel coronavirus, the pandemic has put a massive swath of learners and families through the various motions of online learning — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"&gt;remote test proctoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21419012/edgenuity-online-class-ai-grading-keyword-mashing-students-school-cheating-algorithm-glitch"&gt;automated grading&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21559291/school-shooter-lockdown-code-red-drills-online-zoom-covid"&gt;safety drills&lt;/a&gt;. It’s brought heightened scrutiny to strategies that schools have been employing for years, and a new urgency to the question of how much transparency institutions owe their students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyB0Z2"&gt;Legally, the school is likely within its rights to continue using a professor’s recorded lecture after their death. “Generally when you work with a university, you sign a contract that says ... intellectual property you generate is our property,” says Joseph D’Angelo, an attorney who specializes in IP, copyright, and trademark. “There’s not much you can do about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2bBwQ"&gt;That’s not always the understanding on the ground, though. “I think the default position in higher ed is that an institution doesn’t stake claim to a professor’s course materials or lectures,” says Jeremy Bassetti, a humanities professor at Valencia College. “If I were alive and I learned that another professor was facilitating a course I developed without my consent, I would ... make some phone calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1NZiGg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many universities’ blackboard installs will literally not allow you to delete video lectures once you’ve uploaded them. It’s no stretch to think universities will try to use these to re-teach courses sans prof, with only a TA, copyright or not. Be mindful. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yhb8Emv1WI"&gt;https://t.co/yhb8Emv1WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mar Hicks (@histoftech) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/histoftech/status/1291110549183442948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSwY3q"&gt;Bassetti isn’t alone there. As colleges announced their plans to move instruction online throughout early 2020, scores of faculty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373669/recorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;expressed fear&lt;/a&gt; that their universities would use their recorded lectures as they pleased. “It’s no stretch to think that universities will try to use these to re-teach courses sans prof, with only a TA,” one professor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/histoftech/status/1291110549183442948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1291110549183442948%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21373669%2Frecorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. “Be mindful.” In mid-March, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21175420/university-college-closure-coronavirus-covid19-housing-internet-security"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of US universities abruptly shifted to recorded models, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers publicly warned schools to keep their hands off new recordings. “Institutions should not take this opportunity to appropriate intellectual property to which they would not otherwise have had access,” their &lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aft-and-aaup-principles-higher-education-response-covid-19#.XsK0IC2ZPPA"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG8mLw"&gt;In countries where lecture recording was common pre-pandemic, the issue has been controversial for years. In 2018, when the UK’s University and College Union organized a nationwide &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; in response to suggested pension cuts, &lt;a href="https://thetab.com/uk/warwick/2018/02/26/warwick-university-propose-use-of-lecture-capture-to-combat-strikes-26691"&gt;some universities&lt;/a&gt; proposed running recorded lessons in order to keep classes going. (In 2016, &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lti/2016/11/10/lecture-recording-in-uk-higher-education-results-from-a-survey/"&gt;over 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the country’s institutions were using lecture recording systems). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373669/recorded-lecture-capture-copyright-universities-coronavirus-fears"&gt;Backlash&lt;/a&gt; to those proposals was so severe that it led some schools to permanently change their recording policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YIcR4"&gt;Students have also taken issue with the lack of access to their instructors. COVID-19 has drawn new attention to an age-old, persistent question: what is college tuition actually paying for? Some US colleges have kept their typical price tags in place after moving their courses online; &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/07/harvard-full-tuition-coronavirus.html"&gt;supporters&lt;/a&gt; have argued that they’re still, after all, providing the same degree. But these decisions have been met with &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/harvard-hit-with-backlash-for-keeping-tuition-costs"&gt;widespread&lt;/a&gt; blowback from students and families who claim that online classes don’t provide the same benefits as in-person ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwAFbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an access issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2aigPg"&gt;College students commonly pay tuition, and register for classes, with the expectation that they’ll have some degree of access to their professors — through discussion groups, office hours, in-class questions, even the ability to chat by email or phone. Intuitively, that’s the argument for taking university classes online rather than watching lectures on YouTube for free. A deceased professor can’t respond to emails, facilitate class discussions, or provide networking opportunities — and while that’s not a dealbreaker for all students, it may be for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF4K9d"&gt;Ansuini is one such student. He has a learning disability, and following up with instructors outside of class has been an important aspect of his online education. “When there’s an asynchronous lecture I’ll communicate with the teacher and I’ll build a back-and-forth with them so they know I’m keeping up,” Ansuini says. A situation where his professor is unreachable is “an access issue.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEMuVC"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Concordia spokesperson Vannina Maestracci said, “We, of course, regret that this student felt they had not been clearly informed and have updated Dr. Gagnon’s biography in the course information provided to registered students.” Maestracci noted that Gagnon “developed this online course some years ago with eConcordia,” but did not address whether Gagnon had explicitly consented to the course running after his passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM29A2"&gt;It’s not unreasonable for students who believe they’re paying for a living, available professor to expect a living, available professor, D’Angelo says. The extra perks that come from those connections, he believes, are more than perks — they’re understood to be fundamental aspects of a university education. He likens that understanding to an unwritten contract. “You could make a legal argument ... that I signed up to all of these fringe benefits, I’m not getting it because of COVID, and I can’t even interact with this person on an electronic level,” he says. “I’m not sure they would win, if a student was to bring that suit, but I think there might be some damages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCLvPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regular scrutiny must be given by relevant program leaders”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DXuDmt"&gt;Accountability is a factor as well. A deceased professor can’t update their teaching style in response to student feedback, or modernize their material as their field moves forward. It’s important for students to know if a course may be out of date, says Stacy Peazant, an academic and research administrator at the University of Florida. “Such a course should not be exempt from evaluation by students at the end of the term, and regular scrutiny must be given by relevant program leaders,” Peazant told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kf0ZV1"&gt;The potential benefits of posthumous classes, of course, are also obvious. Online learning provides an opportunity to preserve the work of renowned educators, and pre-recorded lectures have clear utility as teaching tools, especially as a model for new lecturers. But transparency can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdcCVB"&gt;Lia, who asked to withhold her surname for privacy reasons, says she wasn’t bothered by an online modeling class she took with a deceased professor during her freshman year at Eindhoven University of Technology several years ago. The professor’s recent passing, she says, was announced during the introductory lecture. That made the course feel like a mark of respect — she appreciated that her professor could continue teaching.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pnr4bG"&gt;Still, the announcement colored the experience. “It was a little like watching a movie and knowing one of the actors in it has passed away,” Lia says. “A bit strange and unsettling, but not too distracting from the story.” Eindhoven University of Technology did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5HG1Zv"&gt;Ansuini is going to finish out his art history class. But he hopes his university will handle future situations differently. “We don’t live in a world where someone dies and you don’t care,” Ansuini says. “I think it lacked tact and respect for this teacher’s life, and his work, and his students, to think that’s not noteworthy.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook blocked in Myanmar after users protest military coup</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAwt4K"&gt;Myanmar’s government has blocked access to Facebook in the country, after users turned to the company’s services to protest &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;this week’s military coup&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook confirmed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the country’s telecoms providers had been ordered to block its services, adding, “We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information.” Myanmar’s government has ordered the services to be blocked until Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yK9O0"&gt;The block comes after users reportedly turned to the social network to protest after the military ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detained her along with other members of her party. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that users on Facebook were sharing photos of themselves banging pots and pans as a sign of protest, as well as images of a three-fingered salute — a gesture that’s become a sign of resistance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDVKsH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RskwSX"&gt;Telecoms provider Telenor &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-military-blocks-Facebook-as-activists-call-for-protests"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it has followed the government’s orders, saying it has “decided to comply with the directive, while expressing grave concerns regarding breach of human rights.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports that an internet monitoring organization, NetBlocks, confirmed that Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all unavailable via the state-owned Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications’ network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzTrDH"&gt;Facebook is an integral part of Myanmar’s internet ecosystem. “For the majority of Myanmar’s 20 million internet-connected citizens, Facebook is the internet” was how a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bsr-facebook-myanmar-hria_final.pdf"&gt;report from 2018&lt;/a&gt; put it, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes that Messenger is the primary communications channel for most of its citizens. It’s believed around half of the country’s population holds a Facebook account, meaning any attempt to block the service is a significant move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GaOnI"&gt;This close relationship between Myanmar’s internet and Facebook has created problems. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;Facebook admitted&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t done enough “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"&gt;to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence&lt;/a&gt;,” after critics said its platform had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook-idUKKCN1GO2PN"&gt;played a role in genocidal violence in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said it was investing in “people, technology and partnerships to examine and address the abuse of Facebook in Myanmar.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Cameron Faulkner? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bMPYgQqm8Zdcyd1KXq9tin8t2k=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767645/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How to share a workspace in a studio apartment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2zOZeT"&gt;It’s hard enough to be a writer, reviewer, and tech enthusiast for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; under normal circumstances. It’s even harder when you’re working out of a shared studio apartment during a pandemic. Cameron Faulkner, who not only handles our deals pages but also writes on a wide variety of topics, has somehow managed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHQQmy"&gt;We asked him to explain how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MumhSN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1U46K"&gt;Hi! Tech has always been my passion, and I’ve been happily writing about tech professionally for about seven years, nearly three of those at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Before I got work in the field, I was employed at KFC, at a fulfillment center for school supplies, as a pharmacy technician, and as a cashier. I’m always oddly proud to share my strange brew of work experience with anyone who will listen. I grew up in the Midwest in Mansfield, Ohio, but I’ve lived in Brooklyn, New York, since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFHRmL"&gt;My primary focus at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is on Verge Deals, including daily deal roundups that my colleague Taylor Lyles and I hand-pick each day. That also includes helping to write content for the Verge Deals Twitter account, as well as publishing a weekly newsletter. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;You can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;!) Aside from that, I write about gaming peripherals, write reviews and how-tos, and help the news team cover pressing stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLUuXy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntqjIj"&gt;Organizing distinct zones in a studio apartment is a challenge that I’ve yet to overcome. All of these zones sort of bleed into each other, and without having actual rooms with walls to get space from, say, pots banging in the kitchen, or other distractions, it can be incredibly difficult to stay focused. Though our latest arrangement is possibly the best that we’ll ever manage in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQF0RYTMMxO8GSSUkoSXVo24594=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277287/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0023.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aWcZG"&gt;My wife and I have our desks facing in opposite directions. Just out of frame, behind where I sit, is her desk. We’ve been forced to be very efficient with these space constraints, and it’s miles ahead of where we used to be. We actually used to share this one desk that’s pictured here, with my one monitor, keyboard, and mouse on the right and her setup on the left. The pandemic made us rethink this strategy. Suffice it to say, my current setup is a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0SD7I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOAxEt"&gt;First off, I’d advise people to resist the temptation to buy a glass desk, good as they look. It’ll show dust after just a few days — even faster if you have cats who like to climb on it and nuzzle on the corners of your monitors. That said, I’ve had this one since 2008, so clearly, it’s a good product (or I’m just a good-enough owner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR0ECY"&gt;Secondly, my desk is never as clean as the picture above indicates. I usually have another mug or two on it and some errant review products strewn about. That said, I actually do prefer a minimalistic look (difficult as it is to maintain). No disrespect to my colleagues who have been featured in this series, but I don’t have many tchotchkes that I want to display at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz2EQd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your desk chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3u48Ij"&gt;The desk chair that I use is the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hermanmiller.com%2Foffice%2Foffice-chairs%2Faeron-chair%2F2195348.html%3Flang%3Den_US%26&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller Sayl&lt;/a&gt;, which usually sells for around $600 — the low-end of that company’s lineup, believe it or not. I almost purchased this chair in mid-2020 when the chair that I had was really causing me physical anguish, but Vox Media allowed me to borrow it from our NYC office. So I immediately drove there, stuffed it into my car, and brought it home. My cats and I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkOp4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2TwJ2"&gt;I built that PC, and it’s filled with parts ranging from as far back as 2014 to recently. The case is the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-silverstone-temjin-series-microatx-mini-tower%2Fp%2FN82E16811163182&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SilverStone Temjin&lt;/a&gt;, built to accommodate small microATX motherboards. You might be able to see from the photos that it’s a little scratched and beat up. I love that this case size is small enough to fit on a monitor stand, so I can fit the head of my vacuum cleaner underneath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPc2Ma"&gt;Inside the case, I have an Intel Core i5-9600K processor, EVGA’s GeForce RTX 2070 graphics card, 16GB of RAM, and a 1GB NVMe SSD. My cable management isn’t great, but the case shuts and the wires are out of harm’s way, so I’m content with it. My goal is to keep the system fast enough to run any game near its highest graphical settings, but I don’t usually buy the latest components right when they release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d8GlZxwDQ1S3wGXtBAv_5sbzHVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277288/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0024.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ovDzLA7AN-NbKBuUorMAp1JmC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277283/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDZBCBHrnp7mgdsaekhRB1qE4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277282/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEPT8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you have two displays. How do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sePysG"&gt;I like to keep my static batch of Google Chrome tabs open on the left screen (apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Asana task management, etc.), along with any article I’m currently writing. On the right side is where I keep Slack, as well as tabs that are more temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aQPr2"&gt;Outside of work, I game on the left monitor (a 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XV272U-Pbmiiprzx-Technology-DisplayHDR400/dp/B07MQBPMJ2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f206e718f9ea664f49ee39125db521d3&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Nitro XV272U&lt;/a&gt;) because it’s a QHD IPS panel with a fast refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.  Having a two-monitor setup was something that I got used to having in our work office, so I purchased a second one (a 27-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-27GL650F-B-Ultragear-Compatible-Monitor/dp/B07R7636MH?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b3c2a4268610cc93a0ce14b6ad545c34&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG 27GL650F-B&lt;/a&gt;) for myself a few months into the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vurGKV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lE2BTu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxYF4C"&gt;A few devices that always have a spot on my desk are a mouse (whichever one I’m testing at the moment) and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business-5KV-00001/dp/B00CYX26BC?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=449c04aa3e829f8e1b14a20ebf384f43&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, along with my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Pebbles-Stereo-Computer-Speakers/dp/B00F8HRSN2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=88b985f80f59c56abdd4025260c8dfe7&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;JBL Pebble desktop speakers&lt;/a&gt;. JBL doesn’t make these USB-powered speakers anymore, so they currently cost more than they originally sold for (and are worth), but I really enjoy their simplicity and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V59w3"&gt;I keep my company &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro%2F&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=aa7faac466a0fb028a74ae84cbe3a61c&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; headset (hanging on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Master-Dynamic-MP1000S-Headphone-Stand/dp/B00NGX45FE?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=498ff54d18479f9f2ad71d290c5e9aa9&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic stand&lt;/a&gt;) on the top of my desk when I need to join a meeting at a moment’s notice. There’s also my phone, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lamicall-Cell-Phone-Stand-Dock/dp/B014INJCT4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=344bfc5337157eeb710daf632022e164&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;metal Lamicall stand&lt;/a&gt;. Under my desk, I have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brainwavz-Headphone-Holder-Gaming-Headsets/dp/B07T1HBBSG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=16de5af2010346a8b5cd20c4a1dd7d1f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brainwavz BigT headphone hanger&lt;/a&gt; to keep an extra pair handy. I also like to hang a long USB-C cable on it that’s used for connecting to my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-2/dp/B08F7PTF53?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=05f9c17b334ce35602c9cbc4c6c384c8&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 headset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jlVXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgOlLK"&gt;Tucked nearly out of sight on my desk is our Ethernet switch, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-WiFi-Router-Generation/dp/B07YMKD6SM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=eb3cb7d6fabdbaf93399c8f7c8c76794&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Wifi wireless router&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=7c07c9c84f2796dd57e07804ad5220a8&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIaqBV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting keyboard. I’ve seen split keyboards like that, but never actually met somebody who uses one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MDDos"&gt;I didn’t think I’d be someone who would use one of these, but about a month into the pandemic, I was ending each day with sore wrists and forearms. There were plenty of pricier ergonomic keyboards out there, especially ones with mechanical keys, but the Microsoft Sculpt seemed like a good fit because it’s wireless and relatively affordable. It helps to orient my wrists in a more natural way while typing, and it makes a huge difference for me. The material used in the wrist rest actually gets kind of grimey after a few weeks of use, but dampening it with water and soap works well enough at restoring its original look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyuylS5RQ4xflwW_5vnv9guXlCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277278/cfaulkner_210128_4392_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="KfijqX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omoOuo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that, like others here, you sometimes depend on an old-fashioned notebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNjXsu"&gt;Yep! I used one in the office and like to keep one here with me at my desk. It’s all too easy for an important task to get buried in Chrome tabs, or to forget about a due date that’s coming up. It’s simply the best way I know how to stay on task for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVMEkR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything significant about your Dreamcast cup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ymr9"&gt;I’m a big fan of the Sega Dreamcast console, but the cup itself is significant because I purchased it at Super Potato, a popular video game store in Tokyo’s Akihabara section. I’m not big on getting souvenirs from places, but I knew I had to bring this one back to the US. I don’t even drink from it. (I’m too scared to break it.) I just keep little things in it, like pens, portable hard drives, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perfection, for a price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ElfjNL"&gt;I have used a heck of a lot of laptops in the past year, and some of them are quite nice. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; have nailed the “premium” look and feel for years, and I’ll never waste an opportunity to gush about the build quality of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Bacy"&gt;But I’ve never touched a consumer laptop as gorgeous as the Spectre x360 14. The new Spectre’s sturdy black body, lustrous accents, and boldly sharp edges would make it a standout among convertible laptops across the board, even if it didn’t have a slew of other excellent qualities — which, from its 3:2 screen and packaged stylus to its stellar performance and battery life, it absolutely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYsUFd"&gt;With a starting MSRP of $1,299.99 ($1,589.99 as tested) the Spectre x360 is easily my new favorite 2-in-1 laptop. Today’s market is full of capable convertibles that look good, work well, and do certain things really well. But while the Spectre x360 14 isn’t a perfect laptop, it tops the pack in almost every area. It’s a stylish chassis, premium panel options, stylus support, a powerful processor, and fantastic battery in one. It’s proof that you can have it all — for a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzPwnD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10318703"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N83jRV"&gt;The HP Spectre line is second to none when it comes to design, and this latest model is no exception. Like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21022770/hp-spectre-x360-13-2019-laptop-2-in-1-convertible-review-price-specs-features"&gt;13-inch predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the Spectre x360 14 is made of CNC-machined aluminum. Also like its siblings, you can get the 14 in “nightfall black,” “Poseidon blue,” or “natural silver.” Take a look at some pictures before selecting your color because they each have pretty different vibes. The nightfall black option has a sophisticated, svelte aesthetic that looks tailor-made for a boardroom. Poseidon blue is friendlier and probably the one I’d go for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGxIXx"&gt;The accents, though, are what make the Spectre stand out from the legions of other black laptops out there. Lustrous trim borders the lid, the touchpad, and the deck. The hinges share its color, as does the HP logo on its lid. It’s bold without being obnoxious. The two rear corners are diamond-shaped, and one of them houses a Thunderbolt 4 port on its flat edge. (On the sides live an audio jack, a USB-A, a microSD slot, and an additional Thunderbolt 4, which is a decent selection — gone is the trapdoor that covered the USB-A port on the 13-inch model.) And the edges are all beveled, making the notebook appear thinner than it actually is (it’s 0.67 inches thick). Careful craftsmanship is evident here — I’m not exaggerating when I say this Spectre feels like artwork.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 14 sits open on top of a piano. The screen displays a blue and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTaS3t8yz6f1jWxkUi2gr5y8Tl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279294/mchin_190429_4395_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2n0E6h"&gt;And, as the “x360” moniker implies, the Spectre is a 2-in-1. At 2.95 pounds, it’s a bit heavy to use as a tablet for long periods, but it’s smooth and easy to fold and the hinges are quite sturdy. Unlike with many convertibles, there’s barely any wobble when you use the touchscreen. The display is also stylus-compatible; the Spectre ships with HP’s MPP2.0 pen, which attaches magnetically to the side of the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9EH4T"&gt;Despite its design similarities, this Spectre looks noticeably different from its ancestors, and that’s because of the screen. The new model has a 3:2 display, which is 13 percent taller than the 16:9 panel on last year’s device. (It’s kept the same 90 percent screen-to-body ratio.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZF6Sw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s barely any wobble when you use the touchscreen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvqNLG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface devices&lt;/a&gt; have been using the 3:2 aspect ratio for years, and I’m glad that the Spectre line is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;finally making the switch&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re used to using a 16:9 display (which many modern Windows laptops have) and you give a 3:2 a shot, you’ll see what I mean. You have significantly more vertical space, which means less scrolling up and down and less zooming out to fit everything you want to see. It makes multitasking significantly easier without adding much size to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMecpb"&gt;This 3:2 panel can come in a few different forms. My test unit has an FHD option that HP says should reach 400 nits of brightness. I measured it multiple times, but it only reached 285 in my testing — which is dimmer than I’d hope to see from a device at this price point. I’ve reached out to HP to see what’s up and will update this review if it turns out to be a bug. (Of course, 285 nits is still more than enough for indoor office work.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 keyboard angled to the right, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01OVkXhSal0LsU_lQG4pIKRsUYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279296/mchin_190429_4395_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OLED panel is certified for “low blue light.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7vd1I"&gt;In addition to the FHD display, you can opt for a 3000 x 2000 OLED panel (HP didn’t provide a brightness estimate for this one; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/hp-spectre-x360-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LaptopMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measured it at 339 nits) or a 1,000-nit option with HP’s Sure View Reflect technology, which makes the screen difficult to read from the sides. This will mostly be a benefit for business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKkQwp"&gt;In terms of other specs, the base model pairs the 400-nit screen with a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage (plus 16GB of Intel Optane). Then, there are a few upgrades you can go for. My test unit, priced at $1,589.99, keeps the base model’s screen but has a heftier processor (the quad-core Core i7-1165G7) and double its RAM and storage. I think this model is a good option for most people — it gets you a top processor and a good amount of storage without too stratospheric of a price tag. If you want to get fancier, you can get the OLED screen and 1TB of storage (plus 32GB of Intel Optane) for $1,699, or the Sure View screen and 2TB of storage for $1,959.99.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3DMar"&gt;Of course, laptops aren’t just for looking at, but you’re not compromising on performance to get this build quality. The Spectre is verified through Intel’s Evo platform, which means that it offers a number of Intel-selected benefits including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, all-day battery life, quick boot time, fast charging, and reliable performance. In my testing, it more than surpassed those standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back left corner of HP Spectre x360 14 up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66wdDIYOi3WwYN_8IbNURb4V5fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279300/mchin_190429_4395_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a single USB 3.2 Type-A port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back right corner of the HP Spectre x360 14, up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hm0woa6hJr_GN4cqGgrDa6-4t-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279299/mchin_190429_4395_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, one audio jack, one microSD card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SryCPQ"&gt;The system handled my heavy workload of Chrome tabs, downloads, and streams speedily with no issues. Battery life was excellent; I averaged 10 hours of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That means if your daily tasks are similar to mine, the Spectre should make it through your workday with no problem. (You’ll likely get less if you opt for the OLED panel.) The processor also includes Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. While you wouldn’t want to use those for serious gaming, they’re capable of running lighter fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vz9Eg"&gt;Elsewhere, I have almost no complaints. The backlit keyboard is snappy with a solid click — it’s easily one of my favorites. The speakers sound good, with very audible bass and percussion. There’s a fingerprint sensor to the left of the arrow keys and a Windows Hello camera, neither of which gave me any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VXGHdZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have almost no complaints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSETcC"&gt;Apart from the dimness, there are only two things about this laptop that I’m not in love with. They’re both minor; the fact that I’m even mentioning either of them in this review is a testament to how excellent this device is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do3FEc"&gt;The first is the touchpad. It’s quite smooth and roomy (16.6 percent larger than that of last year’s Spectre x360 13) and handles scrolling and gestures just fine. But it’s noticeably stiffer than some of the best touchpads on the market. The press required to physically click is firm enough that I ended up doing it with my thumb most of the time. On the likes of the Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook, clicking with a finger is much less of a chore. When I first clicked with the integrated buttons, I also had to overcome some initial resistance to hit the actuation point (put plainly, every click felt like two clicks). This issue resolved itself during my second day of testing, but it’s still a hiccup I generally only see with cheaper items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 angled to the right, seen from above, with the lid half closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77sw6GQXcjmTzkSaF1zs8RkSGAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279298/mchin_190429_4395_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My complaints are minor — this is almost perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmvWG"&gt;Secondly, bloatware. There are a number of junk programs preloaded onto the Spectre and several pinned to the taskbar. Dropbox, ExpressVPN, McAfee, and Netflix are all on here, and I got all kinds of notifications from them. This is an oddity at this price point, and seeing cheap McAfee alerts popping up on the Spectre is like seeing really ugly bumper stickers on a Ferrari. This software doesn’t take too long to uninstall, but I’m disappointed to see it nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPccJl"&gt;But those are really the only two complaints I have, and neither of them should stop you from buying this laptop. It’s beautiful to look at and a dream to use. I found myself using it in my free time instead of my personal device (which almost never happens with review units — I really like my products). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kSk2vo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318535"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rca27c"&gt;When we’re evaluating a convertible laptop at the Spectre’s price point, the big question is how it compares to the gold standard of Windows convertibles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. The XPS has a few advantages: it’s a bit thinner and lighter, its touchpad is less stiff, and it has a more modest look that some users might prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Or3b"&gt;But for me, the ball game is close but clear. The Spectre x360’s meticulous craftsmanship, classy aesthetic, and 3:2 screen put it over the top. It also edges out the XPS in a few key areas: the keyboard is more comfortable, the battery life is better, and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-2-in-1-laptop%2Fx29310ekfkh%3Fview%3Dconfigurations&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22264792%2Fhp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;closest-priced configuration&lt;/a&gt; to this unit only has half its storage. The Spectre’s smaller amenities that the XPS lacks — like the bundled stylus, the USB-A port, the blue color, and the OLED option — are icing on the cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o0mWjO"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium Windows convertible with a classy aesthetic, that makes the Spectre a no-brainer purchase. This is HP at its best; it’s a luxury laptop in pretty much every area. I can’t imagine that it won’t be the next laptop I buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I love my weird Belkin wireless charging tree thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDB-gpLkUEmu3lrdmAmosYNnh4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767462/DSCF7493.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qxoDeO"&gt;A $139.95 wireless charger that looks like a cross between a bonsai tree and the decor from 2001: A Space Odyssey might seem like a niche product. But if you have an iPhone 12 and an Apple Watch, Belkin’s ridiculously named &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGA2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge-pro-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-magsafe-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22265910%2Fbelkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Boost↑Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; is actually great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHeoqa"&gt;Charging Apple devices has gotten more complicated recently, at least for me. Now that the Apple Watch tracks sleep, I’ve been charging it with a messy cable at my desk for an hour or so when I start the day, instead of overnight. And while I prefer to use vertical wireless chargers so I can read notifications as they come in, the iPhone 12 mini turns out to be too small for most stands — the charging coil isn’t high enough on the back of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN13sD"&gt;Belkin’s new charger not only solves both of those problems, it makes wireless charging a better experience than ever before. The tree-like design has two stainless steel “branches” — one on the left with a 15W MagSafe puck for the iPhone, and one on the right with an Apple Watch charger. There’s also a 5W Qi charger embedded in the base, which should work with pretty much any Qi device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="E175fr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple MagSafe Duo charger is overpriced and under-delivers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69eALR"&gt;This is the first official third-party MagSafe charger, and I find it far more useful than either of Apple’s own options. It props the phone up at the perfect height for quick glances when you’re at your desk, and the charger’s base is sturdy enough that you can attach and detach the phone one-handed without the base moving around. The phone feels very secure either by itself or in Apple’s MagSafe-compatible leather case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xCbdZPmuI9xcJD6JpD91HKuWEY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280659/DSCF7495.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL1ffo"&gt;The Apple Watch charger works equally well, and I’m glad that something like this ended up on my desk instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower universal charger&lt;/a&gt;. That device was supposed to charge the Watch as well as the iPhone, but it probably wouldn’t have worked with the loop-style bands I usually wear as they’d get in the way of the watch’s charging element. This solution works with all watch bands, and it’s much more convenient than fiddling with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treFM4"&gt;The Qi charger on the base does what you’d expect it to. It’s ideal for low-powered Qi devices like AirPods that only charge at up to 5W, but it’s fine for Android phones too as long as you’re not in need of a fast charge. The base is big enough to fit larger phones without the steel stand getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQvjKo"&gt;My biggest complaint with this charger is that the power supply uses a barrel jack instead of USB-C, but it’s not a big deal for something that will never leave my desk. It’s still not for everyone, of course. You might reasonably think the design is too weird or the price too steep. I personally like the way it looks, though, and while it’s certainly not cheap, I think it’s better value than either of Apple’s MagSafe chargers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKp3Nb"&gt;Belkin also makes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;similar MagSafe dock without an Apple Watch charger&lt;/a&gt; for $100, which is probably a better option for most people. If you’ve found yourself with my specific charging dilemmas of late, however, I can recommend the 3-in-1 version pretty highly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube ends support for old 2012 Apple TV, but you can still use AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CYs8_m4v-W895j4klNtUj3zRFh8=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767426/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Apple TV was first released in 2012. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EILhF7"&gt;Starting next month, YouTube will no longer be natively available to stream on the third-generation Apple TV, first released in 2012. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that a message is being displayed to users warning them of the upcoming change. The fourth-gen Apple TV HD  and fifth-gen Apple TV 4K, the two streaming boxes Apple currently sells, are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBrOF4"&gt;Here’s the full message being shown to users (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XD67VZ"&gt;Starting early March, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Apple TV (3rd generation). You can still watch YouTube on Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, iPhone, or iPad. With AirPlay, you can also stream YouTube from your iOS device directly to any Apple TV (3rd generation or later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf39WS"&gt;While it will soon no longer be possible to natively run YouTube on the third-generation Apple TV itself, owners will still be able to stream the service from an iPhone or iPad using AirPlay. We’ve got a guide on how to do so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21248047/airplay-apple-tv-how-to-stream-iphone-macbook-watch-video"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh9Ikh"&gt;Other streaming services have also gradually been dropping support for older Apple TV models. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/17/hbo-now-app-removed-from-2nd-and-3rd-gen-apple-tv-as-hbo-ends-support/"&gt;HBO pulled its HBO Now app&lt;/a&gt; from second- and third-generation Apple TV boxes, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216451/hbo-go-max-apple-tv-third-gen-support-extended-april"&gt;initially delaying the move&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic. These apps won’t be the last, either. While its newer devices run tvOS and feature a built-in App Store, the built-in apps on Apple’s old TV boxes relied on streaming services working directly with Apple to offer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s44vlE"&gt;If you own an old Apple TV and simply can’t live without the YouTube app, then it might be time to replace your streaming device. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;current top picks&lt;/a&gt; for the job are the Roku Streaming Stick Plus and Roku Premiere, which are both more affordable than Apple’s current lineup of streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new CEO says it’s not done making video games, despite problems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VpZKxCXHnWSfbBrex_Q-Uf09VCQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767228/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lNyzLd"&gt;Amazon’s incoming CEO, Andy Jassy, says he’s committed to Amazon’s video game development efforts, in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week about the problems facing the team. “Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy wrote in a staff email &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS [Amazon Game Studios], I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQoXul"&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter,” Jassy continued. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaoMsI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being successful right away is obviously less stressful, but when it takes longer, it’s often sweeter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpYBO"&gt;The message comes at a critical time for Amazon Game Studios, the e-commerce giant’s video game development arm. The decision to set up the division reportedly came directly from outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who recently announced he is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down from the position later this year&lt;/a&gt; to be replaced by current Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy. With the company reportedly spending almost $500 million a year on its as-yet unsuccessful video game division, it’s important that it has the support of the incoming CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fgh2ND"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous report alleged that Amazon Game Studios has faced a host of problems including a studio head who lacks experience in video games, a “painfully slow” in-house game engine, and a “bro culture” that doesn’t give women the same opportunities as men. In response to the report, studio head Mike Frazzini has reportedly emailed the team, saying that there’s “zero tolerance” for “anything less than a fully equitable and inclusive environment.” In his email this week, Jassy expressed support for Frazzini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSQujC"&gt;Despite Jassy’s support, Amazon Game Studios is still facing challenges. Last year it released, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;pulled and cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;, a hero shooter that drew inspiration from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. Another of its tentpole games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World,&lt;/em&gt; was also delayed&lt;/a&gt;, while a video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; was released to such poor reviews in 2019 that it was later &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt;removed from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. AGS might have the support of Amazon’s next CEO, but it’s got a long way to go if it wants to earn the support of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9iGoD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen wants its new Beosound Level to outlast your average connected speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2UmWk02WaWaQ-89lSjQS0waIcmw=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68767124/CS_Level__wood__5.tif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level is available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pd7iNU"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s Beosound Level is the Danish brand’s latest battery-powered connected speaker. It supports voice controls via Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and you can also stream to it via the AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Spotify Connect standards. B&amp;amp;O says the Beosound Level uses a modular construction that it claims will make it usable far into the future. It’s a welcome feature, considering the speaker’s high $1,499 (£1,099) starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPdH9g"&gt;While many stereos and amplifiers from the middle of the last century can still be used today, the average lifespan of modern integrated audio systems is far shorter. If your music system contains a computer, then it’s inevitable that it’ll eventually become outdated. B&amp;amp;O’s hope is that the modular design it’s using for the Beosound Level will help the company keep it supported for longer, as well as making it easier to repair when components fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9NQ4JyqbVwWT8bWUztyLLCT1es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278651/CS_Level__fabric__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level can be wall mounted...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j8gJmwmZVFV6VQU8juXJL8YFC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278652/CS_Level__wood__1.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...or used as a freestanding speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmd68"&gt;Central to this modularity is the Beosound Level’s streaming module, which houses the speaker’s digital signal processing (DSP) chip, wireless connectivity tech, and antenna array. It’s B&amp;amp;O’s first speaker to use it, but the company says it won’t be the last; it’ll be standardized across its future lineup of home speakers. B&amp;amp;O says there’s enough processing headroom in the hardware that ships with the Beosound Level that it should be able to handle updates in the immediate future. But when the hardware reaches its limit, the company plans to offer an upgrade service for users who are prepared to send their device in to the company to have the streaming module replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFPNXQ"&gt;The Beosound Level’s battery is also modular, and unlike the streaming module, it’s user-replaceable. However, its form factor won’t be standardized across B&amp;amp;O’s speaker lineup, so replacing it will require a battery made specifically for the Beosound Level. Battery life is rated at up to 16 hours with volumes at moderate levels, dropping to four hours at max volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aUz6zQbX6ew7-7-1Z4uyJ9cmQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278655/CS_Level__wood__4.tif.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A magnetically attaching disc can be used to charge the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xL3roo0AwpHZtJ02PwzutPz_u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278845/BangOlufsen_BeoSoundLevel_MeroxCMA_Warm_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beosound Level’s modular components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LI9Qhi"&gt;Other features include a built-in accelerometer that allows the Beosound Level to adjust its sound depending on whether it’s standing vertically, horizontally, or hanging on a wall. (A wall bracket is available separately for $119, or £89.) Internally, the speaker has five drivers: two 4-inch woofers, one 2-inch full-range driver, and two 0.8-inch tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8D90"&gt;Charging is either handled via a USB-C port on the speaker itself or by attaching a small magnetic plug (which is powered over USB). The speaker has an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, touch controls, and it’s available with wood or fabric finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z6XQv"&gt;We’ve seen companies try to take modular approaches with their devices before, but success has been elusive so far. Modular smartphones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; gotten off the ground, and Alienware’s promises about a modular future-proof laptop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;fell apart after just one year&lt;/a&gt;. Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen tells me it hopes to support the Beosound Level for years after it eventually stops producing the speaker, so it might be some time before we see if it’s able to deliver on its goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDgIa3"&gt;The Beosound Level is available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
