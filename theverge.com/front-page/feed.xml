    <title>Twitter unblocks Indian politicians’ accounts after suspending them for violating disclosure law</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has reinstated several Indian politicians’ accounts, after suspending them for a tweet about a child murder.  | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPkrcE"&gt;Twitter has reinstated the accounts of several politicians in India’s opposition party, which were suspended after party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted a photo of himself with the parents of a girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in New Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-reinstates-accounts-indias-rahul-gandhi-other-opposition-leaders-2021-08-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1422779132249788416?s=20"&gt;Gandhi had tweeted his support&lt;/a&gt; of the girl’s family, saying that they deserved justice and others had shared his tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJRBC2"&gt;However, Indian law prohibits the disclosure of the identities of children and sexual assault victims. According to a notice posted on the Lumen database, India’s National Commission for Protection of Child Rights requested Twitter take action. A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Gandhi submitted a copy of an authorization letter from the people in the image to the company’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india"&gt;India Grievance Channel&lt;/a&gt;, and his account was reinstated. But the tweet in question, which has been shared more than 15,000 times, will remain withheld in India even though it is visible globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbiyqY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614205/twitter-appoints-grievance-compliance-officer-comply-india-rules"&gt;Twitter appointed its grievance officer&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, to comply with new internet rules in India governing social media platforms. It’s been a bumpy few months between Twitter and India’s government; in June, the government warned the company it could face “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to follow the rules, and in July, India informed Twitter that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;lost its legal immunity for its users’ posts&lt;/a&gt; because of its non-compliance. On August 10th, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619718/twitter-indian-government-internet-it-rules-compliance-grievance-nodal-officer"&gt;government determined that Twitter was in compliance&lt;/a&gt; with the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2viGqA"&gt;Twitter’s moderation policies have also been criticized by Indian officials; police raided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;Twitter’s offices in Delhi and Guragon&lt;/a&gt; in May after the platform labeled a tweet from a government official as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;manipulated media.&lt;/a&gt;” In other instances, however, Twitter has taken action at the government’s request: It suspended more than 500 accounts and reduced the visibility of some hashtags &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, that had with links to widespread farmers’ protest, and has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;censored tweets that criticized India’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 review: flexible flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An improved ThinkPad X1 Yoga with an updated screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iL0KEf"&gt;Once upon a time, the Thinkpad X1 Yoga was Lenovo’s flagship business convertible, joining the clamshell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Carbon&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the company’s business hierarchy. These days, it has more company. We now have the paper-thin, titanium-coated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224757/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-carbon-business-laptops-intel"&gt;X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, the featherweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;, and the powerhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18019002/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-review-the-right-mix-of-work-and-fun"&gt;X1 Extreme&lt;/a&gt; kicking around, all of which are excellent, pricey, and could reasonably be considered flagships in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yev80s"&gt;There’s a lot of innovation happening across the ThinkPad line, but the X1 Yoga retains a lot of the hallmark features that have graced old-school ThinkPads over the years. (With a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y6%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting tag of $1,493.40&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 as tested&lt;/a&gt; — that includes the premium price.) There are some subtle but important upgrades, of course, including a 16:10 (finally) touch display, a new gray color, a wider touchpad, and new security features that will mostly appeal to business users. It’s far from the most cost-effective Windows convertible you can buy, but it does have a lot to offer — especially to long-time ThinkPad fans looking for a modern spin on an established package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XwbJgc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10699890"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3f6tr"&gt;Starting with what’s new: the 16:10 aspect ratio is here. This is a change that Lenovo has brought to other top ThinkPads this year, including the X1 Nano. I much prefer this to the 16:9 panel we saw on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-Gen-5%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gen 5&lt;/a&gt;, because it provides noticeably more vertical space without adding much footprint to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7IrfR"&gt;The other thing to note about this display is its matte texture — you don’t see matte touchscreens very often. Writing on it with the stylus feels basically the same as writing on a glossy panel, though the sound of the tip dragging along is a bit louder on the matte screen. (I also prefer touching the matte texture, though preferences vary.) Mainly, the matte texture makes colors look a bit muted compared to those on glossy screens, but you’ll also see significantly less glare, and work in bright settings is a much more doable prospect. The colors were sharp enough that watching videos was still enjoyable, and I could make out the details well enough, so I found the matte texture to be a positive overall. The panel also didn’t retain any smudges or fingerprints during my testing period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rii5pBH-yKexE0ZxnouDQX6pTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779116/mchin_210811_4712_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader and power button in one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 logo on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above on a stone table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnr7Bp-Hu9GyrnQS5Q0g9_wWPYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779114/mchin_210811_4712_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fingerprints here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPzkuv"&gt;The other notable change: the touchpad is bigger. Specifically, it’s 4.33 inches wide, where the Gen 5’s (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-5th-gen-2020-review"&gt;much maligned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5"&gt;by reviewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5-review/"&gt;for its&lt;/a&gt; small size) was just four. It is plenty wide now, though it’s still a bit short, and my fingers hit the plastic frame often as I scrolled. If the trackpad is too cramped for you, the X1 Yoga offers you plenty of other ways to click: There’s a set of discrete buttons at the top of the touchpad (though they lack the red accents that often appear on ThinkPad clickers) as well as the signature ThinkPad TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. And the unit comes with a tiny stylus, which lives in a garage on the right side of the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="4jRDAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10699900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32IsSK"&gt;And then there are a number of updated security features, which Lenovo has drizzled across the ThinkPad line. There’s an optional IR webcam with human-presence detection which can automatically lock the computer if you’re not nearby (the webcam itself has a physical shutter, as ThinkPads traditionally do, and delivers a fairly grainy picture), a match-on-chip fingerprint reader in the power button, a dTPM 2.0 security chip (which encrypts user data on the system), and an optional feature called Privacy Guard which makes your screen harder to peek at from the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCMu1X"&gt;But the most noticeable update is to the look. While the Gen 5’s chassis had some gray on it, the Gen 6 is gray everywhere, including the keyboard, touchpad, and hinge. This means that the Yoga looks a bit different from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295588/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-p-series-p15-p17-p15v-p1-release-date-price-specs-features"&gt;sea of other ThinkPads out there&lt;/a&gt;, which are traditionally very black. It gives the X1 Yoga more of a futuristic vibe than devices like the X1 Carbon and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147697/lenovo-thinkpad-x-series-t-series-lineup-announce-pricing-release-date"&gt;the X13&lt;/a&gt;, though red and gray aren’t nearly as striking as red and black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7RT6p"&gt;Anyway, to each their own on the aesthetic. What’s slightly disappointing is how easily scratchable the finish was. I folded my unit into a tablet and placed it onto an outdoor table for a few minutes for some brief drawing and writing, and when I picked it up there were scratches on the palm rests. I was afraid to let the device near anything remotely sharp after that. If this was the effect of a few minutes of writing, I worry about how scratched up this chassis could get from daily tablet use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2A106"&gt;Otherwise, I have no complaints about the build quality. There’s a bit of flex in the keyboard deck, but none in the display, and there wasn’t any screen wobble while I was typing or touching the screen. The finish didn’t pick up many fingerprints (an issue I sometimes have with black ThinkPads). The hinge is smooth, making folding and unfolding a breeze — I could pop it open one-handed, with some difficulty. It’s also a fairly portable product, at three pounds and 0.59 inches thick, though a bit heavy to hold as a tablet for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPd X1 Yoga Gen 6 half open, angled to the left, seen from behind on a stone bench outdoors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhK5aYiyNSX8iqrlU3sQVgG-noc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779117/mchin_210811_4712_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aluminum on the top, aluminum on the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Yoga in tablet mode, seen from above, on a stone bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zl6J0Y0KRPN32xf7o9qnJF4yD30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779115/mchin_210811_4712_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in tablet, tent, stand, or clamshell modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aUe5r5"&gt;Elsewhere, the X1 Yoga is very good. ThinkPad keyboards are world-renowned, and this one — while flatter than those of some of its siblings — is still comfortable with excellent travel. Note that like most ThinkPads, the Yoga has half-sized arrow keys, and the Fn and Ctrl keys swapped from where they are on the majority of other laptops, which takes a lot of getting used to. (You can remap those keys, but having incorrectly labeled keys can still be an eyesore to some.) The port selection is great, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports (a new addition to the X1 Yoga), a USB 3.2 Type-A, and an HDMI 2.0 on the left, as well as a USB 3.2 Type A, a headphone jack, and a lock slot on the right. The four 360-degree microphones did a fine job of picking up my voice. And the Dolby Atmos speaker system sounds great, with audible bass and very clear vocals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9dJrj"&gt;The X1 Yoga Gen 6 has a million and one configurations, with all kinds of add-ons. One interesting thing: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F20XYCTO1WWENUS1%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheapest listed model&lt;/a&gt; (currently $1,493.40) is actually a Linux model. The base specs include a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage. My test model (running Windows 10 Pro, not Linux) is listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and includes a quad-core Core i7-1165G7, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1HokC"&gt;Then there are the various extras. Windows 10 Pro will cost you $60 more than Windows 10 Home. You can bump up to a 3840 x 2400 screen, or a 1920 x 1200 screen with Privacy Guard. Both of these options are only available with the IR camera, which is $30 over the regular camera. Human Presence Detection, also only available with the IR camera, is an extra $15. And you can add 4G and 5G mobile broadband; prices vary depending on the modem you select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 open on a stone bench seen from above. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBm389xUS6rM1XKy5zDiDT7W_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779118/mchin_210811_4712_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See those scratches on the clickers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbXikR"&gt;The Core i7 utilized here is the same processor found in many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market and is enough for all kinds of demanding workloads. Intel’s Iris Xe graphics card can lend a hand with work tasks and lighter gaming, though the X1 Yoga isn’t a gaming laptop by any stretch. Apps launched quickly, and I didn’t notice much stuttering or slowdown during my day full of streaming, photo editing, and Slacking on top of around a dozen Chrome tabs. Performance does depend somewhat on your battery profile more than with other Windows laptops — I had to switch off of Battery Saver when I was trying to run a Zoom call on top of a heap of tabs and apps because everything started freezing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esOlrk"&gt;Speaking of battery, the X1 Yoga’s life span isn’t a disaster but was still just fine for a convertible at this price point. I averaged eight hours and seven minutes of continuous use with the screen at medium brightness. That’s not a bad result, but I’ve seen better from the top ultraportables at this level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCiomq"&gt;The final observation — which I’m probably a bit too happy about — is that there’s no bloatware on this thing. No McAfee, no Norton, no nonsense that I had to uninstall as soon as I turned it on. I generally hope that laptops above the $1,000 mark won’t come loaded with this stuff, but I regularly see them on pricey consumer laptops from all kinds of companies (including Lenovo). I’m glad that the ThinkPad isn’t loaded with any junk, but consumers should get this experience, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 in easel mode angled to the left on a stone outdoor bench. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmIz4gzxrst-lJY0PR5nYS0N0Fg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779120/mchin_210811_4712_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloatware-free zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMq79"&gt;With so many add-ons and configurations, and prices ranging from $1,500 to over $3,000, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga can really be what you make it. It can be a midrange convertible with basic specs, or it can be a premium business laptop with the security emphasis characteristic of the ThinkPad line. Among the saturated sea of convertible ThinkPads out there, it’s absolutely one to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN0y6p"&gt;With that said, it’s quite a pricey line for a consumer or self-employed worker. For context, you can get a comparable model of Lenovo’s top consumer convertible, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F82BGCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1,529&lt;/a&gt; — which even has the Core i7-1185G7, a step above the chip that came with my test model. X1 Yoga models with that processor start at $1,938. Like the X1 Yoga, the Yoga 9i has a convertible form factor, a physical webcam shutter, a built-in stylus, a one-year warranty, and most of the same software from Lenovo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abv5Fo"&gt;That raises the question of what all that extra money is really paying for. The X1 Yoga’s 16:10 aspect ratio is certainly a bonus, as are the lack of bloatware and the matte display. On the other hand, the 9i has better battery life (as do many consumer convertibles at that price), exceptional audio, and some truly innovative features like a haptic touchpad and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. At a certain point, X1 Yoga buyers are really paying a premium for the ThinkPad build. ThinkPads have some unique aspects — their TrackPoint and the unique keyboard arrangement will always have their devotees — but they also have a sleek, professional look and feel. They’re known for their extreme durability (and the X1 Yoga is MIL-spec tested, though the X1 Yoga’s scratch-prone chassis and the flex in its keyboard gives me some pause on that front). Overall, like the MacBook’s bitten apple, the ThinkPad logo is a graphic anyone will recognize. It’s associated with a high level of build quality, longevity, and performance — it commands a certain status among business users and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AjX25r"&gt;Which is all well and good, if that’s what you want. If you’re looking for a modern ThinkPad that’s competitive with today’s best laptops, and especially if you’re interested in tidbits like Linux and human presence detection, this is probably your dream machine. I just feel obligated to note that if you’re so-so on the ThinkPad branding, you can get most of what this offers for much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury decides Apple should pay $300 million in patent dispute</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents involved in the case once belonged to LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/14/apple_google_patents/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, but were obtained by Optis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef1C6I"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday but told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it plans to continue to fight the decision. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate,” the statement reads. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzv9dF"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; record third-quarter revenue of $81.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford asks court to dismiss GM’s lawsuit over “BlueCruise” driver assist feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AUTOMOBILE-ENVIRONMENT-FORD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIQolDt7HM7JbL8CagOd2n3Y-CA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69726231/1232993947.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLoa4K"&gt;Ford has filed a motion asking the US District Court in San Francisco to dismiss a lawsuit from rival GM over Ford’s BlueCruise self-driving feature. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to Super Cruise, the name of GM’s hands-free driving tech, which it introduced in 2017, as well as its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbysi7"&gt;Ford said in its motion that the term “cruise” has been been in “ubiquitous use” over the past 50 years to refer to driver-assist features. “Consumers understand “cruise” to refer to a feature in their vehicle that performs part of the driving task or assists them in driving, and they do not associate that term with any one company or brand,” Ford argued in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42W8Mp"&gt;In its lawsuit filed July 23rd, GM said the two the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to come to agreement. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing,” GM alleged in its complaint, adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new, unique brand, it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6AWb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist feature in April, and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software update to select vehicles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXvDjy"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday that the company considered GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous,” adding that for decades drivers “have understood what cruise control is, every automaker offers it, and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand” for such features. In addition to seeking to have GM’s case thrown out, Ford has petitioned the US Patent and Trademark Office to rescind GM’s trademark of “Cruise” and “Super Cruise,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGqQG"&gt;GM did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sYVwgI"&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial plan to try to curb child sexual abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z3Ld4HzH_dTWyXO8gjMRz1XVXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725913/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple ‘s plan to scan iOS devices for CSAM imagery has proven controversial | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why privacy experts are concerned&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dc6dr1"&gt;When Apple announced changes it plans to make to iOS devices in an effort to help curb child abuse by finding child sexual abuse material (CSAM), parts of its plan generated backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twOtsC"&gt;First, it’s rolling out an update to its Search app and Siri voice assistant on iOS 15, watchOS 8, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey. When a user searches for topics related to child sexual abuse, Apple will redirect the user to resources for reporting CSAM, or getting help for an attraction to such content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jhnc4"&gt;But it’s Apple’s two other CSAM plans that have garnered criticism. One update will add a parental control option to Messages, sending an alert to parents if a child age 12 or younger views or sends sexually explicit pictures, and obscuring the images for any users under 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX8SA"&gt;The one that’s proven most controversial is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple’s plan to scan on-device images to find CSAM&lt;/a&gt; before they images are uploaded to iCloud, reporting them to Apple’s moderators who can then turn the images over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the case of a potential match. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple says the feature will protect users&lt;/a&gt; while allowing the company to find illegal content, many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;Apple critics and privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt; say the provision is basically a security backdoor, an apparent contradiction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple’s long-professed commitment to user privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh7kyv"&gt;To stay up to speed on the latest news about Apple’s CSAM protection plans, follow our storystream, which we’ll update whenever there’s a new development.

    <title>Go read this story of tech workers who secretly work multiple remote jobs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Home Office" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWpN_SgkIvCRwz8VHInM3KUDPhs=/549x0:5499x3300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725456/1230667805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Some workers use remote jobs to juggle multiple employers | Photo by Fabian Strauch/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkhjVp"&gt;For journalists and others in creative and technical fields, having a side hustle or doing freelance work is extremely common. In addition to a day job an editor, for example, one may write paid-per-piece articles for other publications who aren’t competitors of her primary employer, and typically (ideally) with her employer’s explicit or tacit approval. Some people do so for the needed additional income, some like the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="actdTW"&gt;And according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;story in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://overemployed.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; provides tips for tech workers who want to earn two full-time paychecks while working remotely, giving half-assed effort to one (or both) and without letting either employer know about the other. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; describes the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vQRqVd"&gt;Alone in their home offices, they toggle between two laptops. They play “Tetris” with their calendars, trying to dodge endless meetings. Sometimes they log on to two meetings at once. They use paid time off—in some cases, unlimited—to juggle the occasional big project or ramp up at a new gig. Many say they don’t work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined. They don’t apologize for taking advantage of a system they feel has taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dwqvTN"&gt;The workers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; (anonymously) seem to go to great lengths to work for two companies simultaneously; from keeping extremely organized calendars, to juggling overlapping Zoom calls and project deadlines. And while it’s not necessarily illegal to work for more than one company, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports, such arrangements may run afoul of employment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS9b9n"&gt;There’s no doubt that many employers are reaping what they’ve sown with workers across the employment spectrum; along with a lack of job security and meager paychecks, workers are dealing with a pandemic that has upended home and work life for everyone. The thing that bugged me in this piece was how some of the workers talked about gaming the system by lying about what are valid reasons someone would need accommodation from their employer: They use their unlimited PTO for a month off and cite “COVID-19 burnout,” or skip out of double-booked meetings by taking “an imaginary call from a child’s school.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIrsMK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;Go read this very interesting &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; about what it’s like to juggle remote jobs, and how people claim to get away with it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New and existing Google Fi subscribers can get $400 off the new Galaxy Z Flip 3 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpkyw0E8E_Oa4pO2AlBEZuTAV6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725175/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Samsung Galaxy z Flip 3  | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xUzlBk"&gt;Google Fi new and existing customers can &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g"&gt;get the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 &lt;/a&gt;for $400 off, a significant discount on its $999 price tag. There are a &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/promo-terms/?p=2021-august-samsung-flip"&gt;few caveats&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and you have to purchase the phone first and keep it on a Fi plan for 30 days before you get the discount in the form of a bill credit. But if you’re an existing Fi subscriber and had your eye on the Flip 3 anyway, this deal makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc0YT9"&gt;If you’re an existing Google Fi customer on one of its full-service plans — data-only plans are not eligible— buy the phone at &lt;a href="http://fi.google.com"&gt;fi.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on your plan. You have to keep the phone active for 30 days to receive the discount, which comes in the form of a bill credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6utyOt"&gt;Non-Fi subscribers have to activate the phone on a new full-service plan, and must transfer their existing phone number to Fi— if you choose to get a new number on your new Fi plan you won’t get the bill credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtRym3"&gt;Your purchase of a new Flip 3 will also be eligible for a $150 credit to use on Samsung’s website, just order the phone before August 26th and register it with Samsung. With the stacked discounts, you’ll save $550 on the phone, a good deal for a brand-new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwZYch"&gt;The Fi promotion is valid “while the promotion is live and available on the &lt;a href="http://fi.google.com"&gt;fi.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site,” according to Google, and the Samsung credit is valid through November 9th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Nitro XV282K KV monitor is great for next-gen console gaming, but it comes at a high price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is a $900 monitor worth it for next-gen gaming?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="q7siaa"&gt;For years, my primary gaming display has been the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P&lt;/a&gt;, a 21.5-inch screen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution I’ve had since late 2015. Even though it’s old, I’ve had very few complaints with it. But when I picked up both a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X last year, I wondered if I wasn’t using them to their full abilities by not having a monitor that could take advantage of the 120fps and 4K resolution of which the consoles were capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpWHNq"&gt;For the past month and a half, I’ve been able to test &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/28-nitro-xv2-gaming-monitor-xv282k-kvbmiipruzx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer’s Nitro XV282K KV&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s new $900 gaming monitor, with two HDMI 2.1 ports, that supports 4K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates. During that time, I’ve been using it as my primary gaming screen to see if the high cost is worth investing in for higher-fidelity gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vIMGsW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10697233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jgFf0m"&gt;The monitor offers a lot of real estate with its 28-inch 3840 x 2160 resolution (aka 4K) LCD display. Acer says the monitor has a one millisecond response time, and while I didn’t test that specifically, I haven’t felt input lag with anything I’ve tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaxYnZ"&gt;The Nitro has two HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort, so you can plug both next-gen consoles and your PC into the monitor if you want. It also has two built-in speakers, but they’re quite tinny. You’ll definitely want to pair the screen up with a set of external speakers or headphones of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uELwG4"&gt;I’ll admit that I’m not the person to get really nitty-gritty on things like the colors and contrast ratio on this display. I suggest &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/acer/nitro-xv282k-kvbmiipruzx"&gt;reading &lt;em&gt;Rtings&lt;/em&gt;’ review&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed overview there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wH8rvh"&gt;But to me? Everything looked &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URni4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; popped with color, particularly during Ariana Grande’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;dazzling in-game concert&lt;/a&gt;, and felt silky smooth at 120fps. I like to think that I’ve been just a hair more responsive in-game because of the faster frame rate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Nitro looks dramatically better than the PS4 version of the game did on my Asus monitor. Flying over Boca Raton in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593883/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; made me feel like I was taking a mini tropical vacation from the comfort of my own home. More than anything else, I’ve been wowed by having an HDR-equipped screen, which makes everything much more vibrant than what I’m used to on my Asus.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s &lt;/em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;em&gt;on the monitor and what the monitor looks like as part of my desk setup.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RipFiJ"&gt;After more than a month with the Nitro, I was sold on everything it had to offer. I felt like I would never be able to go back to how I had been playing games before, and I was already mentally preparing to put aside some cash for a big monitor upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="160y64"&gt;But then I started playing some Nintendo Switch games again, and I remembered why I’ve never been one to care all that much about visual specs. I get more into a game due to its story and gameplay than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkDi6"&gt;My wife and I have had a blast playing through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597736/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-review-switch-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a port of two games first released for the Nintendo 3DS. It looks fine, but definitely doesn’t match up to the level of detail offered by something like the PS5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve gotten sucked into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing entirely in portable mode, which seems to largely play at 30fps. The other night, I won a round of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Switch on the Nitro, and even though it looks much worse than it does on next-gen consoles and also chugs along at 30fps, I had just as much fun as I always do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGbT256LCAD-uOFz-GizfIrWtCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776484/jpeters_210807_4702_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;em&gt; on the Nitro.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FkbkiY"&gt;My time switching between with Switch games and ultra-high fidelity PS5 and Xbox Series X games on the Nitro reiterated something that I’ve always believed: graphics and whiz-bang technical specs can be impressive, and they can add a lot to a game, but for me the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of the game is what matters most. If the game is fun, I don’t care very much how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfJW3m"&gt;So, to answer my original question, is it worth paying $900 for Acer’s Nitro XV28 monitor to take advantage of next-gen gaming? If you have money to spend, I think so — you’ll probably be quite happy with the monitor. (Though you might have to wait a bit to buy it. The Nitro appears to be sold out as of this writing, but Acer says Amazon and Best Buy will get more stock in September.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu7MX4"&gt;But for most, I’d recommend waiting until HDMI 2.1-equipped monitors are more affordable to buy, or putting aside more cash to spring for a really nice TV. Your next-gen games will look great on the Nitro, but the high cost might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Pcty"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy DJI’s leaked $300 Mini SE drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fuYm0JNouQi3-RVLgr8dwYbeYo=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69724095/dji_mini_se.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c6Dn1w"&gt;In June, we got wind that DJI was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/14/22533473/dji-mini-se-mavic-walmart-leak-price-controller"&gt;about to release its most affordable drone yet&lt;/a&gt;: the $299 DJI Mini SE. It appeared to be a revamped Mavic Mini for $100 less — or depending on how you think, $150 more affordable than the $449 DJI Mini 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our current fav under the $500 mark&lt;/a&gt;. The only question was, would it have any real improvements over the aging Mavic Mini or just be an affordable rebrand? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoI3R"&gt;This week, DJI quietly put the Mini SE on sale, and we now have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT9fIH"&gt;Here are the only differences between the old $399 Mavic Mini and the new $299 Mini SE, as far as we can tell by poring over the company’s spec sheets and FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cxEDVN"&gt;It uses the DJI Mini 2’s newer chassis, with fewer exposed screws, stronger arms, and increased wind speed resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VaXljl"&gt;It uses the DJI Mini 2’s lighter, more powerful LiPo batteries, propellers, and charging hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tBtRaL"&gt;There’s a USB-C charging port on the drone, instead of micro-USB &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GZezeh"&gt;You don’t have to update the firmware to get 24p video or manual ISO settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RUoahQ"&gt;“DJI Mini SE does not have ‘4K’ printed on the lens, and the rear aircraft status indicator is not clickable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hvtjp3"&gt;The rest seems exactly the same — which, importantly, means you &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;get the far longer range and more reliable connection of the DJI Mini 2’s more capable OcuSync controller. The Mini SE comes with the old folding Mavic Mini design that relied on “enhanced Wi-Fi” instead, and you can’t just swap the controller for the newer one either. There’s also no 4K video, just 2.7K and 1080p, and it likely won’t offer the photo quality improvements we enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in our Mini 2 review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3kZh2"&gt;Technically, DJI says a few other accessories are interchangeable between its three mini drones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VpaPHC"&gt;The Mavic Mini battery charging hub cannot charge the DJI Mini SE battery, but the DJI Mini SE battery charging hub can charge the Mavic Mini battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkaqYf"&gt;Although DJI Mini SE can use Mavic Mini’s battery, the power will decrease and the total weight will exceed 250 g, requiring registration in some countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WODTCx"&gt;The DJI Mini SE Intelligent Flight Battery, propellers, Two-Way Charging Hub, and 360° Propeller Guard are compatible with DJI Mini 2. The Mavic Mini DIY Creative Kit, Mavic Mini Snap Adapter, Mavic Mini Propeller Holder, and Mavic Mini Intelligent Flight Battery (international version) are compatible with DJI Mini SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gX6GuJ"&gt;Like with the Mavic Mini, your wireless range depends on where you buy and where you use it, with the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan getting a version (MT2SS5) with 4 km transmission range, while Europe and Asia may be limited to 2 km or even 500 meters depending on the version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DSSsp"&gt;You can find the DJI Mini SE today &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Mini-SE-Improved-Resistance/dp/B098XMSQ3P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fdjimvmnse.html&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fdji-mini-se-quadcopter-with-remote-controller%2F6471584.p%3FskuId%3D6471584&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1651775-REG%2Fdji_cp_ma_00000324_01_mini_se.html%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22624171%2Fdji-mini-se-drone-how-to-buy-inexpensive-cheap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F265261281674&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22624171%2Fdji-mini-se-drone-how-to-buy-inexpensive-cheap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.
