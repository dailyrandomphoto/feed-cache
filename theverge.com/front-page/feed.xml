    <title>Warby Parker can renew glasses and contact lens prescriptions with its updated app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RqFCqZpvxisTNYZtREXMPphrj4Q=/168x0:1419x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600721/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_10.44.40_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warby Parker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="86i0B9"&gt;Warby Parker is updating its Prescription Check iOS app on Monday with a new name and the ability to renew glasses &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; contact lens prescriptions on the iPhone 6S and up (the company currently doesn’t offer an Android app). Like its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warbyparker.com%2Fvirtual-vision-test&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22580166%2Fwarby-parker-contact-lens-glasses-prescription-renewal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a substitute for an actual optometrist visit, but being able to snag a new prescription for $15 without having to schedule an appointment should be very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNCCxj"&gt;With Virtual Vision Test downloaded, you’ll be taken through some intake questions, not unlike what you might fill out in a normal optometrist visit (“Do you regularly get headaches?” etc.). Warby Parker requires you to meet some basic criteria as well, like being 18 years of age or older, not having any “eye health concerns,” using a single-vision distance prescription, and seeing well with your current glasses or contacts. With those taken care of, the app guides you through a simple vision test, reading off letters that appear on your phone’s screen, and alternating covering your eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLH3yy"&gt;Warby Parker says it takes about 48 hours for a new prescription to be written, but it won’t charge you $15 unless you’re approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nOyCPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JyJeui"&gt;Prescription Check used a laptop and a phone to measure out your eyes’ distance from the test and to enter in prompts, but Virtual Vision Test makes things a bit easier. Warby Parker says the updated app uses a new “proprietary distance estimation algorithm” and a software framework exclusive to Apple devices called &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision"&gt;Vision Framework&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep everything contained on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP5xU"&gt;Vision Framework covers a wide swath of possible use cases in iOS, from scanning bar codes to enabling the head tracking used in AR filters, but Warby Parker says that combined with its algorithm it makes the process of taking a vision test less complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1Ei92t"&gt;Because the tool is able to measure distance and tell a user when they’re at the correct distance to take the vision test, the possibility of human error while measuring is reduced. Overall, this results in an even simpler and more efficient user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="spx6Z6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A proprietary distance estimation algorithm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8n54E"&gt;That’s helpful because this is the first time the company’s also offering the ability to renew a contact lens prescription online. Warby Parker’s Scout line of contact lenses &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-19/warby-parker-launches-scout-daily-contact-lenses-at-440-a-year"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but never made it to the older Prescription Check app until now. Warby Parker hasn’t said if any of the technical changes it’s made to its app make it easier to account for a contact prescription, but they do require different measurements and considerations than traditional glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr1YuG"&gt;Ultimately, all of this high-tech convenience is to push you to buy new glasses frames or contacts directly from Warby Parker, and the company’s leveraged Apple tech to make that as fun and interactive as possible. If you have a iPhone X or newer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18205654/warby-parker-ar-iphone-face-id-mapping-glasses-try-on-app"&gt;you can virtually try on the company’s frames&lt;/a&gt; right from its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4UymL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqgrJ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GDC will return to an in-person event in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-INTERNET-GAMES-GDC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBDEokpQA_QK8ckUAUDWiyuFI2c=/0x37:4728x3189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600740/465197440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E2uYjJ"&gt;An all-virtual version of the annual Game Developers Conference kicks off on July 19th, but the organizers say that next year the event will be in person once again. GDC 2022 “will return as a physical conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco,” the organizers say, with the conference taking place from March 21st to the 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIu73X"&gt;While not a major public-facing event, GDC has long been an important week for the games industry, with professionals from all over the world gathering together in one spot. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271702/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-service-announcement-gdc-2019"&gt;Sometimes platforms like Stadia are even announced there&lt;/a&gt;.) The 2020 edition was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21156037/gdc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-gaming-event-san-francisco"&gt;one of the first large-scale gaming events to be put on hiatus due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and while this year’s GDC was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365498/gdc-2021-game-developers-conference-event-physical-hybrid-coronavirus-july-san-francisco"&gt;expected to have an in-person element&lt;/a&gt;, it eventually shifted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"&gt;a completely virtual format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFKOtW"&gt;For those who registered, GDC 2021 runs from July 19th through the 23rd, with a few notable talks and presentations, including &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/events/see-our-full-developer-day-schedule-for-gdc-2021"&gt;the latest tech demo of Epic Games’ UE5 game engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom buys Five9 for $14.7 billion to ‘deliver even more happiness’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NveWo3hf2kOi215vt_AW6nrBbB4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600648/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zoom buys Five9 for $14.7 billion to ‘deliver even more happiness’&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FFMUAJ"&gt;Videoconferencing platform Zoom is acquiring cloud contact center software company Five9 for $14.7 billion, the &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/19/2264531/0/en/Zoom-to-Acquire-Five9.html"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9qbcO"&gt;“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in the announcement. He added that the deal will add more business clients to Zoom’s customer base, and that Five9 is “complementary” to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing%2Fzoom-phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22583371%2Fzoom-buys-five9-14-7-billion-videoconferencing-lockdown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom Phone&lt;/a&gt; cloud system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9kEEG"&gt;Under the terms of the deal, Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom, and CEO Rowan Trollope will become a president at the company reporting to Yuan. In 2020, Five9’s full-year &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001288847/000128884721000029/fivn-20201231.htm#iac51b890630c488aa40d29fada3e7e16_115"&gt;revenue&lt;/a&gt; was up 33 percent year over year to $435 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8p4sLr"&gt;Five9 is Zoom’s first billion-dollar acquisition, and it comes at a time when the company is looking to try to continue the momentum it has gained during the coronavirus pandemic, as people have been working and schooling remotely during lockdowns. Now, many are heading back to offices at least part of the time. “The trend towards a hybrid workforce has accelerated over the last year, advancing contact centers’ shift to the cloud and increasing demand by customers for customized and personalized experiences,” Yuan said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-five9/"&gt;separate blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVaHsf"&gt;Zoom’s stock price has more than tripled since pandemic lockdowns started last year, but that growth has started to slow slightly. Its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/zoom-is-buying-cloud-contact-center-provider-five9-for-14point7-billion.html"&gt;revenue rose 326 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, but in the first quarter of 2021, Zoom reported growth of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zoom-to-buy-five9-in-all-stock-deal-valued-at-14-7-billion-11626662804"&gt;about 191 percent&lt;/a&gt; to $956 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6fONf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oo2VU7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber expands grocery delivery to 400 cities, including NYC and San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, Uber Eats logo of a US online..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7laCw9YKTdIVz5IxnIrbF-Y7d8w=/0x5:3874x2588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600558/1233279060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9V6Qth"&gt;Uber has more than doubled the number of cities where it delivers groceries, marking the &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Accelerates-National-Grocery-Availability-Across-the-U.S/default.aspx"&gt;first major expansion&lt;/a&gt; of the new service since its launch last year. The company’s on-demand and scheduled grocery delivery is now available in 400 cities, including key markets like New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OkoHV"&gt;Uber’s grocery delivery service got turbo-charged by a partnership with Albertsons Companies, the publicly traded owner of major grocery brands like Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Pavilions, Star Market, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci’s Food Lover’s Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtPVAV"&gt;The ride-hailing company (which is quickly becoming more of a delivery company) expects to be able to offer grocery delivery to customers nationwide by the end of the year. Still, Uber will have its work cut out for it as it seeks to compete with major players in the grocery delivery space, including Amazon and Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9PMSHi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber’s core ride-hailing business tanked as a result of lockdown orders&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OmDjwO"&gt;During the pandemic, Uber’s core ride-hailing business tanked as a result of lockdown orders. In response, the company quickly pivoted to food delivery and later to groceries, as it sought to find new revenue streams. Today, Uber is still relying heavily on cash from its delivery products as it struggles to make up for a nationwide driver shortage. Of course, delivery won’t work without drivers either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHFYw9"&gt;To help fuel its grocery delivery expansion, Uber has acquired a number of smaller startups in recent months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;Cornershop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt;, as it seeks to expand its delivery options. In addition to Albertsons, Uber is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419461/uber-gopuff-grocery-delivery-expansion"&gt;partnering with delivery startup Gopuff&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in delivering “essential” or “instant need” items, like liquor, beauty and pet products, snacks, and over-the-counter medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiU5xb"&gt;Using Uber the old-school way, to get a ride somewhere, is more expensive than it’s ever been. Fares are up by as much as 40 percent, with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/style/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi.html"&gt;admitting to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a recent interview that price is “not where it needs to be right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFd8QR"&gt;It remains to be seen how the shortage is effecting prices on its grocery delivery plans. (Uber is promising free delivery on orders of more than $30 for its Uber Pass subscription members.) Khosrowshahi said that the company’s second quarter margins, which are scheduled to be reported August 4th, will be “hurt” by the company’s efforts to lure drivers back with financial incentives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker batteries, cables, and chargers are discounted on Amazon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azmsgz"&gt;Whether you’re gearing up for the back-to-school season or just looking for some extra charging kits to make your vacation go a little smoother, Anker’s latest discounts at Amazon might have what you’re looking for. There are a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/e735e735?showVariations=false&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_slot-15_69e1_dt_dcell_vai_1_e735e735"&gt;handful of products&lt;/a&gt; on sale, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Lightning-Powerline-Certified-Compatible/dp/B08G8NTVQ7?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_60&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a three-pack of iPhone cables&lt;/a&gt; (USB-A-to-Lightning) for $19.49 instead of $30, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Delivery-PowerPort-Outlets-White_Cable/dp/B08B7P7CJX?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_62&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a clever power strip with two outlets and three USB ports&lt;/a&gt; (two USB-A ports and one USB-C 18W PD port) for $26 instead of $36. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charger-Fast-Charging-Adapter/dp/B07YD77RKC?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_65&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 15W Qi wireless charging pad available for $20 instead of $30&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn’t include a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwOL8O"&gt;The niftiest device that’s discounted today is Anker’s Powercore Fusion wall charger-meets-battery pack. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-10000mAh-Delivery/dp/B08GKL41V4?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e735e735_61&amp;amp;smid=A294P4X9EWVXLJ&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The black-colored GaN charger with a 10,000mAh battery within costs $34.50 today instead of $46&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you can charge devices up to 20W via USB-C or up to 15W when you use that port and the USB-A simultaneously, whether you’re connected to the wall or using the Fusion as a battery pack. It probably won’t be powerful enough to charge your laptop while you use it (unless you use something like a Chromebook), but it seems great for smaller devices and accessories. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306269/anker-powercore-fusion-usb-c-power-delivery-battery-charger-review"&gt;Check out Dieter Bohn’s review right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CNN plans to launch CNN Plus streaming service, but won’t say how much it will cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CNN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eN0Xib76RTF6B2x6z2I7IhrgdGE=/0x0:3438x2292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600462/1211180725.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1cn97"&gt;Cable news behemoth CNN said Monday it is joining the ever-crowded streaming marketplace, adding its CNN Plus service sometime in the first quarter, according to a press release. The new service “complements the core CNN linear networks and digital platforms to serve CNN superfans, news junkies and fans of quality non-fiction programming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giGL1n"&gt;Conspicuously missing from the press release was any mention of how much the service will cost, and a spokeswoman declined to provide further details. According to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company is still determining the price for CNN Plus, but there will be no ad-supported version of the service at launch. It will launch in the US only, and CNN expects to hire 450 people over the next six to nine months, &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bq5oY"&gt;The company says CNN will continue to have a single app where CNN Plus subscribers will be able to access CNN Plus programming. The app will include CNN’s linear television feeds, available to paid TV subscribers. If those subscribers want to “maximize their experience, they can also subscribe to CNN Plus, to access the full CNN Plus programming all in one place,” the release says. A CNN spokeswoman clarified that CNN Plus subscribers do not have access to the TVE feeds of CNN’s cable channels, and CNN Plus is a standalone direct-to-consumer product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY5FtH"&gt;CNN Plus will have original, live, on-demand, and interactive programming separate and distinct from CNN’s linear channels, the company says. At launch the service will have a “deep library of non-fiction, long form programming,” that includes past seasons of CNN shows like&lt;em&gt; Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;This is Life with Lisa Ling&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;United Shades of America&lt;/em&gt; with W. Kamau Bell. The service will add new original programming to be announced later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZEcsN"&gt;Andrew Morse, CNN Worldwide chief digital officer, will be the executive in charge of CNN Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Et7lh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spwoev"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia paves the way for RTX GPU Chromebooks with new Arm demo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYQCbZdKiyNVk5a0yMHHmTgwrdg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600347/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJpi77"&gt;Nvidia is working on expanding its RTX GPU support in a big way, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/"&gt;with a new demo at GDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; showcasing high-end gaming technologies like DLSS and ray-traced lighting running on Arm hardware for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1h9wx"&gt;Specifically, the demo shows off &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein: Youngblood&lt;/em&gt; and Nvidia’s “&lt;em&gt;The Bistro&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demo running on an RTX 3060 GPU paired with a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 Arm processor (&lt;a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-announces-new-mt8192-and-mt8195-chipsets-designed-for-next-generation-of-chromebooks"&gt;MediaTek’s flagship-level processor&lt;/a&gt; planned for a new wave of more powerful Chromebooks). Obviously, an RTX 3060 can run those demos on its own — but it’s the groundwork here that Nvidia is building that’s important because it’s offering the drivers and support necessary for them to run on Arm hardware specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43iAe3"&gt;In total, Nvidia says that its ported five RTX technologies to Arm and Linux: DLSS, RTX Direct Illumination, RTX Global Illumination, RTX Memory Utility, and Nvidia’s Optix AI-Accelerated Denoiser. SDKs for those tools for Arm with Linux and Chromium are either available now or will be available soon for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsgPqE"&gt;And while it’ll still likely be some time before you’re able to buy a Chromebook with an Arm chip and an RTX 3080 GPU, today’s news is an important proof of concept establishing that it’s both possible to add that support and that Nvidia is actually interested in building the tools and software necessary to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8GMgc"&gt;Of course, Nvidia &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a newly vested interest in making sure its GPUs play nicely with popular Arm-based systems like Chromebooks in the future, given its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;still pending&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;purchase of Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton plans to launch an in-app video game where you pedal to control a rolling wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3Jb2npjPRuV2gey-Td11xtcKX8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600097/Lanebreak___Gameplay___2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3S5OLB"&gt;Peloton is entering the video game business. Today the company announced its latest idea to get people to exercise: an in-app video game tentatively called Lanebreak. The game, which will only be available for Peloton bike owners and subscribers, involves riders changing their cadence and resistance to meet various goals and control an on-screen rolling wheel. Players can choose a difficulty level, the type of music they want to hear, and the duration of the track before starting. The game isn’t available yet, but a members-only beta will open later this year. Peloton hasn’t share details around how people will be able to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2brPO"&gt;The game’s vibe and interface reminds me of the Rainbow Road in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, with a track trailing off into the universe. It’s more or less the same on Lanebreak, except instead of controlling Mario, you’re pedaling to keep your tire moving and meet specific goals. There are three types of challenges and ways to earn points: Pickups, which means that so long as you’re in the lane that the game commands, you’ll earn points; Streams, which reward you based on your cadence; and Breakers, which reward you based on energy output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsJdq6"&gt;I only had a chance to test the game once on my bike, and personally, I found it boring and confusing to follow, especially compared to instructor-led classes. (I did a 10-minute class and was counting down the seconds until it was over.) However, this feedback also comes from someone who doesn’t play video games and prefers Peloton because of the various instructors’ personalities and music choices. But regardless of the game itself, the idea of a game for workouts is interesting and suggests Peloton is open to new types of content. It’s also especially interesting considering Netflix is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;also building&lt;/a&gt; in-app video games. It seems both companies see that they need various content offerings to keep people in their apps longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpjC82"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Boosted went bust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoCXiCZZY0LvV9jyD6K0AOQqzYI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599836/VRG_4668_The_End_of_Boosted_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An inside look at how the beloved electric skateboard startup fell apart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V2RgUj"&gt;Kanye wanted a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbP15Y"&gt;That was basically all a small group of employees at Boosted knew in early 2019 after they heard the rapper-mogul had &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/b03nvf/kanye_brought_his_own_boosted_board_to_the/"&gt;taken an interest&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s electric skateboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PqLzb"&gt;A partnership, an investment, an endorsement — whatever he was considering, a meeting with Kanye West seemed absurd. But then again, Boosted was also working on a secret project with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244818/boosted-boards-bikes-bullet-p2-scoot-little-ultimate-tony-hawk-birdhouse"&gt;skateboard legend Tony Hawk&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Was it really a stretch to think the startup could work with Yeezy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o6zNm"&gt;Apparently. Kanye spent the meeting — two, in fact, over the course of 2019 — focused more on his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/entertainment/kanye-west-domes-trnd"&gt;ultimately doomed vision&lt;/a&gt; for sustainable cities than he did discussing a tangible deal with Boosted, two former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. (Kanye could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qq7vna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted’s carcass is still drawing buzzards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRVVWj"&gt;At the time of the Kanye meetings, Boosted had outgrown its Kickstarter roots, and had defined the market for electric longboards — which had emerged as part of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d42G01gZNwI"&gt;a rideables craze&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-2010s. The brand was potent, but the startup was losing focus. It wasn’t just Kanye’s off-topic meetings, though some employees felt they were symbolic. Boosted was just spread too thin. It had launched half a dozen models — each with different configurations — in just six years, on a shoestring budget. Then it was hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21036805/boosted-board-electric-skateboard-finances-money-cash-trouble-customer-service"&gt;on goods made in China&lt;/a&gt;, and a delayed electric scooter, and eventually ran out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCKwMIfwQFTdw2qeQvZGoRb_FmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720509/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_3.50.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Kim Kardashian / Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3JN9Y"&gt;But while Boosted is dead, the beloved electric skateboard startup’s carcass is still drawing buzzards. Its biggest investor, the eponymous venture firm founded by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/martins-beach-vinod-khosla-california-silicon-valley-tech-lawsuit-2020-1"&gt;surfer-fighting billionaire&lt;/a&gt; Vinod Khosla, has spent the last year waging a pair of lawsuits against Lime in an attempt to reverse the scooter-sharing giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224164/lime-buys-boosted-electric-skateboard-scooter-acquistion-bankrupt"&gt;purchase of Boosted’s intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;. (Khosla Ventures is also an investor in Vox Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLLwRl"&gt;Khosla Ventures’ lawyers say Lime sabotaged a potential bailout of Boosted from Yamaha in late 2019 and conspired with Boosted’s biggest debt lender to rig the sale of the startup’s remains a few months later. Lime’s team has argued the powerhouse firm is simply raw about a “failed business negotiation” that ultimately couldn’t save a “dying business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqZrJG"&gt;The fight likely won’t end for months. (A trial is tentatively scheduled for May 2022.) But interviews with six former Boosted employees, as well as an examination of the lawsuits, help reveal in the greatest detail yet just how the category-defining electric skateboard startup fell apart, and why seemingly nothing — not a partnership with Tony Hawk, the constant support of one of YouTube’s biggest stars, or even Kanye West — could save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YlxgTn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rR2ChE"&gt;Things weren’t always so dire at Boosted. The startup was one of Kickstarter’s &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl"&gt;earliest success stories&lt;/a&gt; after it transitioned out of a Stanford incubator in 2012. A few years later, Boosted’s electric longboard became the go-to vehicle for YouTube star Casey Neistat. It seemed like in every vlog he posted, there was Boosted’s board: hanging behind him on the wall of his studio, or under his feet as he carved through Manhattan traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHBoRM"&gt;Neistat made Boosted so popular that it was hard for the startup to keep up with the orders that were pouring in. And co-founder Sanjay Dastoor attained cult status among the startup’s customers — not just because of the quality and popularity of the product, but because he was so hands-on that in 2016 he &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-talked-to-the-guy-whose-boosted-board-blew-up-1788560954"&gt;flew across the country to a board owner’s house&lt;/a&gt; to diagnose a battery failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbHBXF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted was a Kickstarter success, but it really blew up, thanks to Casey Neistat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6532mA"&gt;But Dastoor handed over the company to Jeff Russakow in 2017, a fellow Stanford grad. With that changing of the guard came new, much bigger goals. “The company is just doing splendiferously well, and we’re looking forward to an exciting roadmap of many new form factors of light vehicles and other cool stuff,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16212472/boosted-board-jeff-russakow-new-ceo-pivot"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Russakow told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he wanted to “be able to move faster on innovation,” and do “two major product releases of some cool exciting announcement” per year — “an Apple-like cadence,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQtZ8oBxdO2tBj6HyeapBF26SvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720386/GettyImages_1321702636.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;CEO Sanjay Dastoor (left) and CTO John Ulmen (right) Boosted Board, a battery powered skate board on Wednesday, June 14th, 2017, in San Francisco, California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iI6Bl3"&gt;Boosted rode this momentum for a while, and in early 2018 launched a second-generation board, along with a mini board and a high-performance variant called “Stealth” that eventually became its biggest hit. The startup then raised nearly $80 million by the end of 2018 from Khosla Ventures and others. In 2019 Russakow described that funding round &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as being full of “really supportive investors” who are “absolutely committed to the vision of the company.” He used the money to take Boosted global, expanding the brand into more than 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUWWDw"&gt;Boosted even started working with Birdhouse, the company run by perhaps the most famous skateboarder on the planet, Tony Hawk. The startup also discussed making a board for kids and tapped another pro skater, Andy Macdonald, to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRinPQfQZkw"&gt;work on the project&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted’s electric longboards had never really been a natural fit with skateboard culture, so validation from two of the sport’s icons felt, to some of the employees, like recognition of what they (and customers) already knew: that Boosted’s boards kicked ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zncfYv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New CEO Jeff Russakow took Boosted global — but that required more money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kVHq"&gt;By 2019, Russakow’s efforts to grow the company appeared to be working, too. It even drew interest from premium bike company Specialized, two of the former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKc4ao"&gt;But Boosted needed more money. The growth was eating up a lot of the revenue the company was generating in those new markets, and even cut into the money it had raised. Making matters worse, the company took a hit when then-President Donald Trump started a trade war with China. Boosted had outsourced manufacturing to China starting in 2016, and while Russakow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in May 2019&lt;/a&gt; that the startup had “the financial ability” to “eat” the tariff on the skateboards, it turns out that was easier said than done. (Boosted eventually applied for, and was granted, exclusions from the tariffs, but refunds for them were still outstanding when the startup went under.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvTwjb"&gt;The pressure of maintaining this pace of growth — which was coming from Russakow but also from Khosla Ventures, the former employees say — had Boosted running ragged. What especially tripped things up, though, was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;Boosted Rev&lt;/a&gt;: the startup’s super-rugged, $1,600 electric scooter that debuted in early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiGhg"&gt;Boosted announced the scooter just as its bank accounts started suffering, and almost immediately had to delay the rollout (in part because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20699803/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-injury-broken-finger"&gt;an issue with the latch meant to keep it folded&lt;/a&gt;, but also because scaling up production was tricky). Khosla Ventures and Boosted’s other backers had just put money into the company — they didn’t want to add even more. So in May 2019, Boosted quietly turned to a “venture debt” firm called Structural Capital for what it hoped would be short-term help. The deal’s terms weren’t exactly favorable to Boosted: it had to use all its assets as collateral for an $18.5 million loan. Plus, if Boosted missed certain payments, Structural Capital could take control of parts of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw4uO3"&gt;Boosted spent most of that loan in just a few months. So Boosted’s executives found themselves once again looking for money, just as the summer, their strongest sales period, was ending. In the meantime, Boosted started to delay payments to some vendors and began considering layoffs as early as September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7dpz64"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A desperate deal with a “venture debt” firm in 2019 proved poisonous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee1dXv"&gt;Khosla Ventures and another investor, Activate Capital Partners, made a small loan in October to help keep the lights on while Boosted looked for a way out, court documents show. But it wasn’t enough to stop Structural Capital from taking control of the company’s purse strings. Now every expense had to be run by the venture debt firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNIAJn"&gt;Employees quickly started to wonder how much longer Boosted had. The company no longer had access to its inventory, it stopped spending on advertising, and it certainly had no money to make any new products. Two former employees said they went on Thanksgiving break not knowing if there would be a company to go back to. That feeling of dread didn’t lift when they returned, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgUPPs"&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land,” one former employee says. Some employees banded together to figure out what other sacrifices could be made to save money, like getting rid of free snacks and lunches (which Boosted eventually did) or giving up their company-subsidized Caltrain passes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="llU2K7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KR4iKG"&gt;“The people at Boosted were great,” this person says. “Everyone felt very loyal to John [Ulmen, Dastoor’s co-founder, who remained with Boosted until the end] and wanted to stick it out. There was a lot of untapped potential with the brand. Everyone hung on longer than you’d expect because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm0Ovq"&gt;At one point in mid December, one team inside Boosted was incorrectly told by their manager that everyone would be laid off the following morning. “Everyone panics. Rumors start flying. People are making sure they have their stuff backed up,” says the former employee. But when Russakow called the company together that following day, he swatted the idea down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6ELX"&gt;By that point, word had gotten around that something was going on with Lime, but most employees didn’t know what. The confusion ramped up when employees started taking jobs at Lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs8T6T"&gt;“We would expect to get let go every Friday,” the former employee said. “Then paychecks would come through and people would be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JFdzrJ"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sETnzn"&gt;In the days before Christmas 2019, Boosted’s executives hunkered at their office trying to engineer a way out of a small mountain of debt — who to fire and what to salvage to keep the company alive. Suddenly, Russakow and his team received news that seemed like a Christmas miracle: Japanese giant Yamaha was interested in buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b82OBV"&gt;Those executives had already spent most of December hammering out a deal with Lime that would allow the scooter-sharing giant to hire away a small group of core Boosted employees and license some of the intellectual property around their new scooter in exchange for $30 million worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Ow01G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Yamaha acquisition would have been transformational&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp0LX5"&gt;That deal wouldn’t save the entire company, though, and it wasn’t done. A Yamaha acquisition, on the other hand, would have been transformational. It could have buttressed Russakow’s efforts to grow the startup and expand into new markets — moves supported by Khosla Ventures, which was looking for big returns on its investment, the former employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl6vi2"&gt;A Yamaha deal could have helped Boosted diversify into new categories while shipping products it had waiting in the wings, like an electric bike and new versions of its electric skateboards. But Yamaha ultimately got cold feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cynpTx"&gt;The failed Yamaha deal is at the center of Khosla Ventures’ lawsuits, one of which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/khoslas-lawsuit-against-lime-shows-ugly-side-of-aborted-acqui-hires"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The Japanese conglomerate is never named in the lawsuits, instead referred to as the “Manufacturer.”) Khosla Ventures unequivocally blames Lime for Yamaha backing out in the lawsuits, which were recently consolidated into one case in San Francisco Superior Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr5qJK"&gt;Lawyers for the venture firm have argued that Lime poached Boosted employees while negotiations with Yamaha were ongoing — including the Boosted VP who was coordinating interviews with the people Lime might hire as part of that deal. Khosla’s lawyers also claim Lime coordinated with Structural Capital to freeze the startup’s bank accounts and force it into dissolution — effectively preventing the Yamaha deal. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gyVO9w"&gt;Lime “acted with malice by intending to cause injury to Boosted’s economic relationship with [Yamaha],” lawyers for Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717699/07411502.pdf"&gt;argued at one point&lt;/a&gt;. “Defendants engaged in wrongful, intentional acts designed to disrupt [Khosla Ventures] and Boosted from consummating an alternative transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQ3CS8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khosla Ventures accused Lime of sabotaging the Yamaha deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEAut7"&gt;This all amounted to “sabotage,” Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717701/07229626.pdf"&gt;claimed in court&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted was losing crucial team members and access to cash, killing the Yamaha deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzgHMp"&gt;Khosla Ventures claims there was another twist of the knife, too. Just before this all allegedly played out in January 2020, Lime had come back to Boosted with a revised offer: $15 million in company stock and more Boosted employees in exchange for the scooter IP. Khosla’s team said in court that this was more evidence Lime was up to no good: it struck up negotiations with Boosted under false pretenses in order to steal employees and other nonpublic information from a startup on the rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTlRZ0"&gt;Khosla Ventures and Structural Capital did not respond to requests for comment. A Lime spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1xKY"&gt;Khosla Ventures kept Boosted afloat through February with $2.4 million in bridge loans, but ultimately “decided not to fund Boosted any further” by the end of the month, according to one of the filings. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;laid off most employees shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEjr2H"&gt;In March 2020, Structural Capital moved to foreclose on what was left of Boosted. The venture debt firm wound up in control of all of Boosted’s assets since the startup had used them as collateral. Structural also had the right to liquidate those assets if Boosted violated any terms of the loan — something Khosla Ventures agreed to when that deal happened, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjDZbM"&gt;Structural set up an auction for March 17th. It sent out a notice earlier in the month, which Khosla Ventures received. But one day before the sale happened, the San Francisco area  received a shelter-in-place order, as an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. Khosla says it didn’t attend the sale in order to comply with the public health order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VVUfwu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says there are “zero factual allegations” in Khosla Ventures’ lawsuit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgaVek"&gt;The auction went ahead anyway. There, Structural bought the rights to the tariff refund Boosted was waiting on from the government — a value in excess of $5 million — for just $400,000. Lime walked away with all of Boosted’s IP and remaining assets in exchange for 62 million shares of its stock. Khosla Ventures, Structural, and Lime were supposed to split the proceeds of any sale. But Khosla Ventures says Structural set up a new LLC that bought some of the assets — a move designed to dodge this contractually obligated proceed split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9lv1J"&gt;Lime fought back hard against most of Khosla’s claims. During a hearing in the San Francisco lawsuit, one of Lime’s lawyers argued there was no agreement that Lime wouldn’t solicit or hire employees. He also said there were “zero factual allegations” in Khosla’s complaint to support the claim that Yamaha backed out because of Lime’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5tuY9"&gt;“Your Honor, I — this is, I think, a truly kind of… kind of a mind-bending, in some ways, complaint, because… [Khosla Ventures’] alleges that Boosted was gonna fire these employees; that Boosted was under financial distress; that it, you know, was defaulting under the loan security agreement; that there was gonna be this massive bloodletting,” Lime’s lawyer said, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717703/07537736.pdf"&gt;a transcript of the hearing&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, he continued, Khosla was trying to claim these employees were still valuable and that it held the right to take legal action against Lime for hiring them away. “It just simply doesn’t make any sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8w7Qt"&gt;“It is odd, I’ll give you that,” judge Ethan P. Schulman responded. But, he said, “odd things happen in the world and give rise to lawsuit[s].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UvLKR8"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YbhWkZ"&gt;Before the sale, the other shoe had finally dropped for employees in early March, when the building manager at Boosted’s San Francisco office was served an eviction notice. The company’s leadership told everyone to work from home, but just a few days after that, they laid everyone off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQgvr1"&gt;“We understand this news will come as a surprise to many of you, but unfortunately, developing, manufacturing, and maintaining electric vehicles is highly capital-intensive, and over the last year-and-a-half our business has faced an additional unplanned challenge with the high expense of the US-China tariff war,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;Russakow and Ulmen wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. (Russakow and Ulmen did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZbRQf"&gt;Most of the employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said they didn’t believe Boosted made obvious critical errors. Even the scooter, some said, could have been successful — especially if Boosted had survived through the first few months of the pandemic, after which the sales of bikes and scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt;. Lasting until the Paycheck Protection Program launched in April of 2020 could have, at the very least, bought a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFCS79"&gt;Instead, many of them simply blame Khosla Ventures and acknowledge that Russakow’s aggressive product goals were a reflection of the returns the big firm wanted on its investment. It was in pursuit of those goals that Boosted overextended itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrk3dO"&gt;In the days and weeks after Boosted’s downfall, some of the startup’s most loyal fans still held out hope that it could be resurrected. Every few days they would tweet at Casey Neistat, or Elon Musk, and beg for some sort of intervention — as if the right face with the right money would be able to untangle the legal knot tied around the remains of Boosted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gHinqw"&gt;It’s hard to blame them; after all, throughout its early years, Boosted defied expectations. It was a successful Kickstarter project that turned into a bona fide company, and basically helped create an entirely new category of vehicle along the way. But at its end, Boosted had evolved into something far more common: yet another Silicon Valley startup that struggled to meet ambitious goals set by the people who wound up running the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcrzW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added disclosure of Khosla Ventures’ investment in Vox Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US and allies accuse Chinese government of masterminding Microsoft Exchange cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KV0kOHm3ZvGOMBMtnWQsKPunmag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599821/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0004.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhABMG"&gt;The United States and key allies have &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;accused the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt; for the first time of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks in the West. Attacks attributed to China include the recent Microsoft Exchange hack, a significant and widespread breach that gave attackers access to the email servers of an estimated 30,000 organizations in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GAMp7"&gt;The Microsoft Exchange attack was initially blamed on Hafnium, a hacking group sponsored by the Chinese state. A senior official in the White House told reporters in a briefing at the weekend that the US government had “high confidence” that the Exchange hackers were being paid by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5vCVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is accused of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yhLGN"&gt;“[China’s] MSS — Ministry of State Security — uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit,” said the official. “Their operations include criminal activities, such as cyber-enabled extortion, crypto-jacking and theft from victims around the world for financial gain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzVE4x"&gt;The accusation against China was made by the US, EU, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and NATO, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-19/eu-denounces-china-over-cyberattacks-that-hit-microsoft-server"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEebN5"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/pdf"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;, the European Union said these and other attacks were linked to hacking groups known as Advanced Persistent Threat 40 and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (these labels are used by cybersecurity professionals to track the activity of known organizations). The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) &lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the APT40 group had targeted “maritime industries and naval defence contractors in the US and Europe” while APT30 had attacked “government entities, including the Finnish parliament in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLPZzS"&gt;“The attack on Microsoft Exchange servers is another serious example of a malicious act by Chinese state-backed actors in cyberspace,” said NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester in a press statement. “This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, and alongside our partners we will not hesitate to call it out when we see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukWjBs"&gt;Cyberattacks and ransomware incidents have been on the rise in recent years, with gangs of hackers apparently targeting larger organizations. This year alone, hackers have targeted America’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;largest meat supplier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;a key oil pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, though in both cases the groups responsible are thought to be based in Eastern Europe, and most likely Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2A3IH"&gt;Russia was also blamed for 2020’s SolarWinds hack, which breached a number of US federal government entities, and to which the US responded with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385371/russia-sanctions-solarwinds-biden-white-house-putin-hack"&gt;new economic sanctions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwlCXX"&gt;However, today’s announcement includes no similar sanctions against China for its role in the Microsoft Exchange attack (though these could follow). “The US and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable,” said a senior White House official during a briefing. The US Department of Justice did, though, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion"&gt;announce&lt;/a&gt; criminal charges against four hackers sponsored by China’s MSS for “a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare in a least a dozen countries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XEKwT"&gt;The most notable aspect of today’s accusation is instead the broad coalition of countries that are publicly condemning China. It also the first time the military alliance NATO has formally accused the country of organizing cyberattacks. &lt;/p&gt;
