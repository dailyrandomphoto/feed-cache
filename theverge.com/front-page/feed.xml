    <title>PAX West backtracks, will require vaccinations or negative COVID tests after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpfmFlxUjQIVDat-YE4aNEJXeW8=/85x0:933x565/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639864/Screen_Shot_2020_04_21_at_3.40.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="763Fzr"&gt;PAX West will now require attendees to prove they’ve been &lt;a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/health-and-safety/health-and-safety-information.html"&gt;vaccinated for COVID-19 or received a negative test result&lt;/a&gt; before they’re allowed to enter the convention, organizers &lt;a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/info/news/health-and-safety-update.html"&gt;Penny Arcade and ReedPop announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LMzNw"&gt;ReedPop set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152694/pax-east-west-unplugged-2021-dates-announced"&gt;PAX West 2021’s September 3rd start date in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, it wasn’t planning on requiring attendees to be vaccinated or prove they were COVID-19-free. The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210623183223/https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/health-and-safety/health-and-safety-information.html"&gt;initial health and safety guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for the event instead focused on the face coverings, social distancing, and the cleaning protocols PAX West would feature when attendees congregated in Seattle. You don’t have to scroll very far through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1407767913105268741?s=20"&gt;PAX’s Twitter replies&lt;/a&gt; to see how fans and potential attendees have responded to the convention’s gung-ho attitude toward holding the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XS0jvIPOOpyphrF22dxrj0DSIWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743300/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_9.02.11_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The spectrum of reactions to PAX West’s health and safety guidelines before this week’s change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="weNgms"&gt;Besides the risks COVID-19 still poses, including the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22576904/us-new-covid-cases-rising-again-delta-variant"&gt;growing case numbers among unvaccinated populations&lt;/a&gt;, PAX’s organizers should have known better. Conventions are synonymous with spreading viruses and spreading them quickly. PAX itself is also infamous for &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/pax-swine-flu-outbreak-soars-to-nearly-100-cases-of-h1nerd1/"&gt;the “PAX pox” outbreak of swine flu in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCwjRO"&gt;Taking that into account, it seems obvious that attendees would want more rigid safety precautions to be taken if the event were to continue as planned — especially since ReedPop and Penny Arcade ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356451/pax-east-canceled-online-west-unplugged-penny-arcade-reedpop"&gt;canceled PAX East in Boston&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year due to “public health concerns.” Finally taking the extra step to require vaccinations or proof of a negative COVID-19 test result is not being overly cautious at this point. It's being realistic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees to walk out following sexual harassment lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EZijsW9xRUfNkdtvtqo2gP_3E=/78x0:3714x2424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639634/1233534678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iwlcAW"&gt;Activison Blizzard employees are staging a walkout on Wednesday, July 28th in response to the company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations brought by the state of California. Employees will meet outside Blizzard’s main campus in Irvine at 10AM PST. “We believe that our values as employees are not being accurately reflected in the words and actions of our leadership,” the organizers said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XXAe5"&gt;The news comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California sued the renowned gaming studio and its publisher&lt;/a&gt;, saying women were subjected to constant sexual harassment and discrimination at work. One female employee allegedly died by suicide after having nude photos of her passed around the office. Following the suit, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-fallout-is-what-women-h-1847350882"&gt;numerous employees&lt;/a&gt; took to Twitter to detail additional examples of harassment and discrimination. Former Blizzard president Mike Morhaime also &lt;a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp1ie"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying “I am extremely sorry that I failed you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnKszV"&gt;The company denied the allegations, saying the lawsuit was merely “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKnCgM"&gt;More than 2,600 employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;signed a letter slamming the company’s response&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7d2fH"&gt;Now, employees are putting forward four demands as part of the walkout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="AFoO7B"&gt;An end to forced arbitration clauses in all employee contracts — a change &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;Google employees successfully fought for in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yd5Ii8"&gt;New hiring and promotion processes to increase representation across the company. Employees say that “current practices have led to women, in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups that are vulnerable to gender discrimination not being hired fairly for new roles when compared to men.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bz44el"&gt;The publication of salary and promotion data “for employees of all genders and ethnicities at the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rs29qK"&gt;Allow a diversity, equity, and inclusion task force to hire a third-party organization to audit the executive staff. “It is imperative to identify how current systems have failed to prevent employee harassment, and to propose new solutions to address these issues,” employees say. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="V3LaY7"&gt;Employees who can’t attend the walkout in person are being asked to use the hashtag #ActiBlizzWalkout to lend their support online. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jungle Cruise desperately wants to be The Mummy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVe2kGdtyuKXQI4THo6TvLaZiak=/1x0:4096x2730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639244/9e13281434942c434b7ce30506cbd407_4096x2730_a2a3002e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The adventure flick based on a ride has lofty and often entertaining aspirations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="prV7mM"&gt;A quirky-for-her-age academic and her well-heeled, party-loving brother team up with a sardonic salt-of-the-earth guy to use an ancient map to find something of life beyond death. That’s the basic plot of Stephen Sommers’ 1999 &lt;em&gt;The Mummy&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s the basic plot of Jaume Collet-Serra’s 2021 &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise,&lt;/em&gt; too. &lt;em&gt;The Mummy&lt;/em&gt; was one of the last great adventure films before superheroes took over the genre, and &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; is desperate to recapture that spark. Shockingly, it's pretty effective at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lpH0j"&gt;It doesn’t always work. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt don’t have the same kind of chemistry as Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, and the CGI is often shaky and cartoonish in an unpleasant way. But adventure films are meant to be escapism fun, and &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; nails that part perfectly. Set in 1916, Blunt plays Lily Houghton, an explorer and researcher following in her father’s footsteps and hunting for a magic flower in the Amazon that could transform medicine (and show up the thoroughly sexist explorer society). Jack Whitehall is her brother, MacGregor, who would really rather be enjoying a cool gin and tonic in the shade than traveling to the Amazon, but will do it for his sister. Dwayne Johnson is Frank Wolff, their rugged guide who narrates the journeys on his boat with the same pun-laden jibes as a cast member of Disney’s Jungle Cruise theme park ride. They travel down the Amazon facing all the things you’d expect them to face: dangerous animals, piranhas, ghosts, German submarines, and even a mysterious tribe. (More on that in a bit.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkJoEMLfoVN73ShTu60W1xrUIvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742904/5a8b1c7e82541b37bb10ea82228e2217_4096x2730_77331f69.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are facing off with something scary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="79ZOW1"&gt;With the exception of some goofy twists I absolutely do not want to spoil, it's a very by-the-numbers adventure film in the vein of &lt;em&gt;The Mummy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;King Solomon’s Mine&lt;/em&gt;. There are even whiffs of other movies like &lt;em&gt;African Queen,&lt;/em&gt; and yes, really,&lt;em&gt; Aguirre, Wrath of God&lt;/em&gt;. They fight monsters made of honeycomb and mud and try to avoid a delightfully bizarre German noble played by reliable bad guy Jesse Plemons. And the whole time, it feels like you’re watching something manufactured in a lab to capture that spark &lt;em&gt;The Mummy&lt;/em&gt; had, except everyone working on it in the lab was also doing a few healthy lines of cocaine while they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nl87NJ"&gt;This movie is hyperkinetic, moving gleefully from action set piece to action set piece and going all in on each one. The introduction of Blunt’s character involves a furious fight in a library, and her first meeting with Johnson’s guide has a jungle cat &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an explosion. Their characters are nonplussed by the danger they regularly leap into, but just when you might think they’re getting a little too superheroic, Blunt will careen into some sacks of grain with an “oomph” or Johnson will absolutely miss the landing when swinging through the trees by rope. Even when the less-than-stellar CGI can be distracting, Johnson and Blunt are there to get things back on track with all of their considerable charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbV2k"&gt;And their chemistry, while maybe not as blistering as some other romantic leads, has a comfortable worn-in element to it. Like Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in &lt;em&gt;The African Queen&lt;/em&gt;, they’re playing older characters who are looking for a friend as much as a romantic partner. They trade barbs as often as they trade looks while floating lazily down the river between action set pieces. Jack Whitehall’s MacGregor knows when to steer clear to let the romantic embers burn and when to pop in to get the plot back on track or provide a little levity. Though he does get his own heart-to-heart with Frank Wolff, where he confesses that he loves traveling with his sister and avoiding home because he’s gay and never plans to marry. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LpJ9n1vm11FnYF-BAb7GRRHmnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743219/junglecruise_sdr_uhd239_rec709_r2_uhd_still_22_fc75e87a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a very fun group, but Jack Whitehall is very much comic relief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdLeIC"&gt;Yes, we finally got a gay character saying they are gay in a live-action Disney movie. No gay after the fact, no gay in the background, no gay and dead. MacGregor is the kind of character who is often coded as queer, and in &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise,&lt;/em&gt; they allow him to just come right out and say it — even if I personally, if traipsing through the jungle in 1916 Brazil, wouldn’t just go around outing myself to people I’d just met. It’s a moment that feels sort of like Disney checking something off a checklist, particularly as MacGregor’s sexuality has absolutely no bearing on the plot. After decades of Disney keeping characters in the closet or keeping their sexuality purely subtextual, it's nice to have a character just come out and make it explicit. Hopefully, the next queer character won’t have to be so earnest in their emerging from the closet and their sexuality can be revealed in a more natural way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbBwCU"&gt;Yet, while the film is eager to give us a gay character and a “modern” heroine who drives the plot (and the boat and more than one action scene), there’s one area where &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; feels painfully outdated. That’s in how it treats its environment and the indigenous people who inhabit it. The theme park ride the film is loosely based on was known for being &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/disney-overhauls-jungle-cruise-ride-over-racism-180976841/"&gt;terrifically racist&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney revamped it ahead of the film. One of the most well-known, and also racist, elements of the ride is a character called Trader Sam who holds shrunken heads aloft. In the movie, Trader Sam is played by Mexican actress Veronica Falcón, and she banks on people’s preconceived notions of her and her tribe to get what she actually wants. It's a hearty attempt to reimagine a less racist version of the character, but it doesn’t always sit right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07q0Kl"&gt;The locale and its people are still treated as “exotic” and “unknown.” They’re less people, more plot points to be navigated. Some of the other colonialist elements that are part and parcel for an adventure film like &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; are addressed head-on. There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of characters looking to mine the Amazon for immortality, and the film ends up firmly condemning that behavior. As with Whitehall’s character, there’s this sense that the filmmakers want to do the right thing with respect to the racist elements native to the “lost world” genre of adventure stories. But instead of earning a gold star, the best we can reward them is a yellow one with “you tried” scribbled on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMuyAq"&gt;That trying is what makes the film work. There’s a real earnestness to the whole movie that surpasses some of its very manufactured-by-Disney elements. It can be dopy and it can be misguided, but &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; is also just a lot of fun. Like &lt;em&gt;The Mummy &lt;/em&gt;before it, it’s not without its flaws — but it knows how to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSaFTy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters and on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1118755/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fnew-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus Premier Access&lt;/a&gt; starting on July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV for Android gets new discovery features and more streaming services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMb1toDjqQuEqJaaPLxJBJXEc_4=/0x340:1008x1012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639200/1._GTV_Mobile__For_You___NEW_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google TV for Android shown on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qrSVZb"&gt;The Android app for Google TV is getting new discovery features and support for a handful of entertainment, news, and live TV apps not previously available, including YouTube TV and FuboTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5SVLx"&gt;Google TV’s Android app will borrow some of the discovery tools from Google TV on the Chromecast, including more rows of personalized recommendations as well as the “watched” tool already available on the TV experience. To help improve recommendations, users can now head to the details page of a title and select “watched” if they’ve already seen a series or movie that the platform recommends to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFdk6v"&gt;Additionally, the Android app will now display Rotten Tomatoes scores on show and movie posters, another useful feature carried over from the Chromecast with Google TV experience. Posters themselves are also getting an update in the app with a new 16:9 widescreen revamped look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9McGRPZM0LLSAB9V0104KBUXY_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743188/2._Manage_Services.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps are now available for Google TV with Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WFUk41"&gt;Lastly, the update will bring added support for a number of streaming services to Google TV for Android. Discovery Plus, Viki, Cartoon Network, PBS Kids, and Boomerang will all head to the mobile app with the update, as will additional live TV apps including YouTube TV, Philo, and FuboTV. Apps can be controlled from the Manage Services menu in account settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNqoC9"&gt;While minor changes, the updates to the app should help with discovery and content recommendation within the Android mobile experience. “Watched,” in particular, is a useful tool for weeding out stuff you’ve already seen in your recommendations. And additional support for live TV apps should please cord-cutters who prefer to stream on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is giving the Oculus Quest 2 a storage bump and recalling its foam face masks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFr2DIrIZQjIuapGDbZnN6eUEkc=/781x0:9219x5625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639071/Oculus_Quest_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aJU21"&gt;Facebook is pausing worldwide sales of the Oculus Quest 2 while it upgrades the headset’s storage and supplements its foam facial covers with a new silicone design. Starting August 24th, all Quest 2 virtual reality headsets will come with a minimum of 128GB of storage instead of 64GB. They’ll ship with a silicone interface between your face and the headset on top of the old foam design. And all current Quest 2 owners can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2Fremovable-facial-interface-alert%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;request a free silicone mask online&lt;/a&gt; to cover their foam one, thanks to a recall after some users reported skin irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMeFdQ"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth announced the news &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/community-letter/"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “As more people got into VR with Quest 2, we started receiving reports that a very small percentage of Quest 2 customers experienced some skin irritation after using the removable foam facial interface that comes with Quest 2 and is also sold separately, including as a part of the Fit Pack,” Bosworth writes. “While the rate of reports is small and the majority of reported cases are minor, we’re committed to ensuring our products are safe and comfortable for everyone who uses them.” Oculus says the new silicone mask fits over the foam interface, and future headsets will include both options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71Evny"&gt;The company is now voluntarily recalling all Quest 2 and Quest 2 Fit Pack foam interfaces in cooperation with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Owners can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2Fremovable-facial-interface-alert%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;follow the instructions&lt;/a&gt; on Oculus’ website to get a silicone cover — you’ll need your account login, headset serial number, and an address in &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/orders-and-purchases/headsets-and-app-purchases/quest-2-supported-countries"&gt;one of its supported countries&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you’re among the majority with no negative reaction, the Quest’s foam headset can soak up sweat during exercise and is tougher to clean than a smooth face cover, so a silicone mask could be a welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81tqOA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/facebook-technologies-recalls-removable-foam-facial-interfaces-for-oculus-quest-2"&gt;The CPSC offered&lt;/a&gt; some more detail about the number of complaints — and potentially some rough sales numbers for the Quest 2. It said it had received 5,716 reports of incidents of skin irritation and “approximately 45 reports of consumers that required medical attention,” while the recall affected “about 4 million” units in the US and “about 172,600” in Canada. That theoretically includes all Quest 2 headsets shipped in both countries, plus the Quest 2 Fit Packs (which include two additional face interfaces of different sizes) and any replacements that were sold separately or shipped under warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV9qw2"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306115601/https://www.oculus.com/blog/customer-support-update-for-quest-2-foam-interface/"&gt;first disclosed the foam irritation issue&lt;/a&gt; in December of 2020, saying that “about 0.01 percent of people” using the Quest 2 experienced temporary redness, bumps, or swelling. It compared the irritation to that sometimes caused by foam in motorcycle helmets or ski goggles, emphasizing that it’s different from the normal indentations or redness you might see from the weight of the headset itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50dB2L"&gt;The Quest 2 storage expansion, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/07/new-rumours-suggest-oculus-quest-2-128gb-on-the-way-may-replace-64gb-model/"&gt;was rumored&lt;/a&gt; last week following a leaked retailer product description. It won’t change the $299 base price of the headset, and Oculus will still offer a 256GB model for $399 when the upgrade launches in August — although after the upgrade, the difference between the two will be less stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhZoJG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added detail on the recall from the CPSC’s update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm0MVO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silicone mask fits on top of the foam mask, rather than fully replacing it as initially described. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Ghostbusters: Afterlife trailer will convince you to see this movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZjPZCVLXWKU2qiOgXyyQLVbodY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69639060/ghostbusters_afterlife_sequels_1593442404614_160w.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cUboqc"&gt;There’s a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; that gives away more of the setting and plot than anything we’ve seen to date — and boy, does it look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7t8k8r"&gt;After a year of really weird Americana trailers more reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters,&lt;/em&gt; it's nice to see what this movie will actually be about. While early trailers were full of epic music and wide vistas and whispers, this trailer actually has some ghosts! And Annie Potts! And the voice of Dan Aykroyd! This is the first trailer that actually makes the movie feel like a sequel rather than a weird and mopey kid-focused reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URDVhv"&gt;Crucially, besides the welcome cameos from the original Janine Melnitz and Ray Stantz, there are a lot of actual ghosts in this trailer for a movie about the busting of ghosts. There are ghosts getting coffee and ghosts fleeing from the Ectomobile and marshmallow ghosts and an entire river of slime that appears to be coursing under some truly Byzantium ruins that echo the biggest set piece from the original film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90RjLu"&gt;If I can’t have comedy (this movie still looks pretty dang serious), some goofy ghosts and lore will do. And this trailer is loaded with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsTTWV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; will premiere in theaters November 11th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC now has huge performance improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1S77irTtNRCws-Q5UgL97k4CoI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638908/MFS_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUyZW8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting its biggest update ever on PC today, thanks to a new patch that delivers significant performance improvements. The game has been notoriously demanding since its launch last year, but the team behind the simulator has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558803/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-performance-improvements-patch"&gt;focusing heavily on improving its CPU and memory usage&lt;/a&gt;. PC players can now go ahead and download the latest update, and it should improve frame rates across a variety of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKmDWC"&gt;I’ve been testing the update for the past couple of weeks on my own PC, equipped with an Intel Core i9-11900K and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and the improvements are staggering even on top hardware. I use &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for benchmarks during our GPU reviews, and in the same section flying across Seattle, my frame rate has gone from an average of 45fps all the way up to 68fps. That’s more than a 50 percent leap with ultra settings enabled at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdQG3B"&gt;Even flying across areas like New York City sees some impressive improvements, with my machine now managing to hit 80fps average in what’s typically a very demanding part of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. The improvements are so surprising that I’ve had to double and triple check my settings to make sure I was actually running at ultra on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q92WEM4imItfZn642wMa-WP61IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742709/rEsQK2n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying over New York City now feels a lot better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Se3F9W"&gt;Overall, the game now feels a lot smoother with less random fps drops than before. It should also be a lot more playable on a wider range of hardware as a result. Asobo, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demonstrated the game running on an older system with an Intel Core i7-9700K and an RTX 2060 Super earlier this month. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; jumped from around 30fps to nearly a solid 60fps on this PC with the patch, and CPU and memory utilization also dropped significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkZIcR"&gt;“We have rewritten a lot of the parts of the engine ... in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim,” explained Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch earlier this month. The team has been mainly working on CPU optimizations, and it’s clearly worked out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkieIU"&gt;This has all been achieved without a move to DirectX 12, too. While a DirectX 12 version of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; launches on Xbox Series X / S today, the PC version will remain on DirectX 11. That leaves the door open for even more potential improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfCqSC"&gt;The upcoming move to DirectX 12 will also allow Asobo to introduce ray tracing in the game. Effects should include better water, improved shadows, and the usual reflections that are found in ray-traced games. Asobo has not yet confirmed when &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; will move to DirectX 12 on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR5wpS"&gt;“All the performance improvements come from just improving the simulator,” confirmed Wloch earlier this month. “PC has not yet moved to DirectX 12, the team is still working on it. It may bring improvements further, or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn yourself into a cartoon for your next Zoom call</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEcS0Rd9QlEC-L3x4e57KTBWGfI=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638904/cartoon_yourself_zoom.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Linguini from &lt;/em&gt;Ratatouille &lt;em&gt;stuck in endless Zoom meetings&lt;/em&gt;.  | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVFEGH"&gt;Want to make your next quarterly Zoom check-up a little more interesting? Feel like aggravating your colleagues at the virtual all-hands? If so, why not turn yourself into a freakish living cartoon, courtesy of Snapchat’s desktop app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtDLfx"&gt;We’ve written &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276091/zoom-snap-camera-filter-how-to-youtube-cat"&gt;about the Snap Camera app before&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s fun, free, and easy to use. But Snap seems to have updated it recently with the cartoon filter from its mobile app, which is worth a look in its own right. The filter turns you into a generic DreamWorks / Pixar creation, and is surprisingly fluid. Its ability to capture your full range of expressions is a little limited (it can’t quite do a proper &lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamworksFace"&gt;DreamWorks Face&lt;/a&gt;, for example) but access through the desktop app means you can now use the filter on your next Zoom call, which is both dumb and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6cT2cadQdVYLmTwfiO3BSJ54i8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743093/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_3.31.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The filter is available through Snap’s Snap Camera desktop app on Mac and PC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LosE7H"&gt;To do so, you need to first download and install the Snap Camera app &lt;a href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/"&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll need to give it access to your microphone and camera, and be running Windows 10 or macOS 10.13 or later). Then, start the app, start Zoom, and make Snap Camera your camera input. To do this on a Mac, click “Preferences” &amp;gt; “Video” in the top menu. If you’re on a PC, click the gear icon in the upper-right of the app then select “Video.” Then, from the drop-down menu labeled “Camera,” select “Snap Camera” rather than your current input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jewRwM"&gt;Next, go to the Snap Camera app itself and select the filter you want from the carousel underneath the camera feed. This one is called “Cartoon Style.” Click it and you should be good to go. A little tip: you can click the video or create a custom hotkey (defined under the video feed) to switch between different cartoon styles. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW08 Sport earbuds have wireless charging and a Kevlar case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EE2WUYErs7X0uucvtvpeWfhD3U=/1x0:1356x903/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638842/masterdynamic.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x98xB5"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has announced the latest addition to its distinctive lineup of true wireless earbuds. The new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fmw08-sport-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earphones&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22595944%2Fmaster-dynamics-mw08-sport-earbuds-announced-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MW08 Sport noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/a&gt; are available today for $349, a $50 price increase over the standard MW08 buds released earlier this year. The extra money gets you three main benefits: wireless charging, a redesigned case with a Kevlar finish, and the addition of foam ear tips in the box. They come in black, white, blue, or green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GnLpL"&gt;Despite “sport” being tacked on to their name, these earbuds still closely resemble the MW08 in design — though Master &amp;amp; Dynamic says it’s using sapphire glass this time instead of the ceramic from the regular MW08s. If you’ve ever wanted earbuds that are essentially scratch-proof, here you go. The company claims they’re also shatter-resistant and ready for your most intense workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPFkXS"&gt;The buds are rated IPX5 for water and sweat resistance, which matches the MW08s. Instead of coming with the same shiny, instantly smudgy stainless steel case as Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s previous earbuds, these include a redesigned case made from woven Kevlar fiber. Even the case can handle some of your sweat, thanks to an IPX4 rating. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHcaqZ5uWepRGT2DSDCz3VbTOog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743046/md.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DdKmLi"&gt;The rest of the tech specs (and sound quality) remain unchanged from the MW08; you get 10 hours of continuous listening with ANC enabled or 12 with it off. The charging case nets you an additional 30 hours. Master &amp;amp; Dynamic includes two modes each for noise cancellation and ambient sound. The star of the show remains the 11mm Beryllium acoustic drivers, and like the MW08s, these earbuds have Bluetooth 5.2 and external antennas for optimal wireless performance and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROGuhC"&gt;Aside from the normal silicone ear tips, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is also bundling in two sizes of memory foam tips. The company says these are ideal for workouts, but I often stick to them full-time if I can’t get a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; seal with any of the included silicone options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AT2CCOhHSS2MDP3RRPaCTzaYQIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743065/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_10.38.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="657QxK"&gt;Since its latest earbuds are now capable of wireless charging — another benefit of switching away from the metal case — Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fwireless-charge-pad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22595944%2Fmaster-dynamics-mw08-sport-earbuds-announced-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;releasing a very nice charging pad&lt;/a&gt; for $69 in either gray or black; it tops out at 10 watts of power for your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord now has Threads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrBzCfnfZTSvTSZCHbeQhe0b2LE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69638733/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sW1vwj"&gt;Discord is launching its Threads feature today to allow servers to improve the back-and-forth of conversations on the service. Threads is distinctly different from the Replies feature that Discord introduced last year, and users will be able to create new threaded conversations using a new “#” option across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2InWF"&gt;Threads work very similar to how they do in many other chat clients, allowing Discord users to branch off a conversation away from a main channel feed. A separate feed is generated for threaded conversations, and Discord server admins will be able to control which members of a server can participate in threads. Moderators will even be able to remove people from threads if they’re being troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRu47n-thGflXLIlCBvrrOtx9B4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742905/image3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Discord Threads feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oNcnO"&gt;Discord is also introducing &lt;a href="https://blog.discord.com/connect-the-conversation-with-threads-on-discord-3f5fa8b0f6b"&gt;both public and private threads&lt;/a&gt;. Public threads in a channel will let any members with the send messages permission start and reply to threads, but private threads will allow certain members to create and chat in private. You’ll be able to @ invite people into a private thread or manually add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLLul9"&gt;Discord will automatically archive threads within 24 hours to try to reduce the clutter for channels. You’ll still be able to read threads in an archive tab, but you won’t be able to reply to them once they’re archived. Server admins can configure this up to three days for archive by default, but if a server is boosted to level 2 with Nitro boosts, then private threads and a one-week archive option will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SLoVFb5ScsIyT5CokEbH7uw6Dk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742687/discordthreadsmod.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mods will be able to remove members from Discord threads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gepd3C"&gt;Threads will open up into a split-view panel in Discord, with an option to see a thread full-screen by clicking on it in the channel list. In a busy server, that does mean the channel list could be about to grow in size if users create multiple threads. But the overall goal is to avoid the headache of multiple different conversations happening at once in a single channel, and threads will certainly be useful for the more active Discord servers.&lt;/p&gt;
