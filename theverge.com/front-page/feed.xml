    <title>Razer’s new Kaira Pro headset will bring the bass to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira headset for PS5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoXnARwsGBKRYyxUE-jcZ4E2qLk=/0x0:7244x4829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152884/kairaprops5hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kaira lineup for PS5 has leatherette-covered ear cups.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRXwbL"&gt;After releasing a fleet of gaming products geared toward Xbox and PC, Razer is finally giving the PS5 a little love with two new Kaira wireless headsets, the $99.99 Kaira and the $199.99 Kaira Pro. They aren’t carbon copies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;Xbox versions&lt;/a&gt;, either. Razer made a color palette swap to a white / black colorway, and there’s leatherette covering the ear cups, as opposed to a piece of breathable mesh fabric. But that’s not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLVE3x"&gt;The more expensive Kaira Pro is the only one of the two models to have HyperSense haptics, which will deliver jolts of vibration to make your games and other content more immersive. Razer recently announced that this feature’s coming to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736367/razer-kraken-v3-gaming-headset-design-features-haptics-price"&gt;new (and similarly priced) Kraken V3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; that is also made to support PlayStation consoles, in addition to PC and the Nintendo Switch dock. I’ve yet to experience the HyperSense haptics myself, but it could make for an alluring feature stacked on Sony’s 3D Audio tech on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira headset for PS5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3NSgzl2erb19uOonQbvBkyGUaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018607/kairasmartswitch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Kaira and Kaira Pro for PS5 support 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NdSS5K"&gt;Razer claims to have dipped the TriForce 50mm drivers in titanium for enhanced audio quality in the Kaira Pro. Regarding the microphone, you’ll get a HyperClear supercardioid mic with the Kaira Pro compared to a cardioid mic with the standard Kaira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93xTRc"&gt;Aside from those perks that come with paying more for Kaira Pro, these headsets have several traits in common, including a SmartSwitch wireless feature that lets them connect to a 2.4GHz dongle or low-latency Bluetooth and a 3.5mm jack for wired mode. They both include the USB-C HyperSpeed audio transmitter, with a USB-A adapter for broader compatibility. I like what Razer’s done here with its new USB-C transmitter; it shifted the jack from the middle (where it was located &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kcecA4cBpX8dZ1P9-ZvM6u-xafA=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703920/cfaulkner_210706_4660_0003.jpg"&gt;in a previous iteration&lt;/a&gt;) nearly all the way to one side, so you can utilize the PS5’s other front-facing USB-A port for a different accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer USB-C dongle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6X0EoC8WzsWLd8BvdBJtU21fsDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018594/razerkairaprousbdongle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C jack placement means this dongle won’t extend over the PS5’s USB-A port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjzcJT"&gt;I anticipate testing these soon, and we’ll see if they give Sony’s $100 Pulse 3D headset a run for its money. The market for made-for-PlayStation headsets is finally heating up, as SteelSeries recently launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22726734/steelseries-arctis-7-7p-plus-battery-life-usb-c-features-price-compatibility"&gt;$169.99 Arctis 7P Plus with USB-C charging and better battery life&lt;/a&gt;. Though, this Kaira line might get the edge over both of those if you want dual wireless connectivity via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth. The Kaira is available now. As for the Kaira Pro, Razer will begin taking preorders on November 30th, and is aiming to ship them in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos drained $96 million from an experienced investor — plus some blood</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDsIbbtgu9UPVEwcYjyxY8FP3xU=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152537/1235841861.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;In their meetings, Elizabeth Holmes did most of the talking &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LZBPBi"&gt;Brian Grossman had 20 years of experience in the healthcare space — but his firm, PFM Health Sciences, invested $96 million in Theranos anyway. On the stand, he explained that his firm had relied on Elizabeth Holmes’ information about Theranos, as well as financial models provided by the company, to make the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rMS0S"&gt;Taken as a whole, Grossman’s testimony in US v Elizabeth Holmes was damning. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;the investors from family offices&lt;/a&gt;, he’d visited Theranos’ facilities, had his blood drawn, and sent emails with extensive due diligence questions. He had experience in healthcare. He’d checked out Walgreens’ public statements about the company. But because he’d relied on Theranos’ representations of its technology, he was misled — and he singled out Holmes as being the source of much of the misleading information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uidwK7"&gt;Holmes told him that Theranos could match anything its much-larger competitors, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, could do. That was “a really big statement” about how much the company had accomplished, Grossman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNFUxz"&gt;Grossman, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;other investors&lt;/a&gt; testifying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;before him&lt;/a&gt;, had been impressed by Theranos’ work with the military; he was told that Theranos’ tech was used on the battlefield and in medivacs. And when he heard that Theranos’ tests were used by drug companies to validate experimental products, that dazzled him too. He knew that getting drugs through the pipeline into approval was crucial to pharma companies’ businesses — so for Theranos’ tech to be used for that was a high mark of approval. The financial projections Theranos provided to him had an estimated $30 million coming from pharma companies in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pv3rPQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes did most of the talking in their meetings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Py6OXH"&gt;Of course, neither of these things were true. Theranos devices weren’t used &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/ex-theranos-employee-edlin-says-holmes-told-him-to-conceal-part-of-lab.html"&gt;on medivacs or on the battlefield&lt;/a&gt;. And while Theranos &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; worked with pharma companies, none of them chose to use the tests to validate experimental products, largely because preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701542/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-celgene-bickering"&gt;studies showed the tests sucked&lt;/a&gt;. The revenue projection was weird, partly because Theranos had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; revenue, from pharma companies or otherwise, in 2012 or 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FyPLO"&gt;Grossman says that Holmes, former CEO of Theranos, and her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately, told him Theranos tests took only four hours to produce a result. In a slide deck, a graphic specifically pointed out the consistency of Theranos’ vitamin D tests — which was one of the tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;whistleblower Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt; had worried &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;wasn’t accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmAVYb"&gt;And Holmes did most of the talking in their meetings, Grossman testified. (This matched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;other investor testimony&lt;/a&gt;.) That’s bad news for Holmes’ defense, which has been trying to argue that Holmes naively trusted Balwani and that he was the real villain at Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4BQ73"&gt;Grossman followed up after the meeting with a long list of due diligence questions. He wanted to know, for instance, what the limitations on the tech were. Holmes and Balwani were “emphatic” that their devices were labs shrunk down to the size of a box, he said. Holmes was “very clear that this technology was not a point-of-care test, not a point-of-care testing platform, it was a miniaturized lab,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFAusA"&gt;That was very exciting — a hugely disruptive technology. Grossman was told that the entire Phoenix market for Theranos could be supported in a lab of 200 square feet; a competitor lab at Quest Diagnostics, which he’d toured, was hundreds of thousands of square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="IxOm4q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balwani was squirrely when Grossman wanted to speak to representatives from Walgreens&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYo9YZ"&gt;Throughout the course of the meetings and email exchanges, neither Holmes nor Balwani mentioned that the Theranos technology was used for just a handful of tests. No one mentioned that they used third-party equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYthWG"&gt;The Walgreens deal also bolstered Grossman’s confidence, though Balwani was squirrely when Grossman wanted to speak to representatives from Walgreens. He told Grossman that it wouldn’t look good and he was “uncomfortable with that,” Grossman testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXDIuG"&gt;He was also told that there was a deal with UnitedHealthcare, which suggested legitimacy to Grossman. He wanted to talk with them about the Theranos partnership. “We highly value their ability to vet technology and new companies,” Grossman said. But Balwani nixed that idea, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Pl4Ir"&gt;Those denials “forced us to rely on the representations they made to us,” Grossman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwu6fX"&gt;Grossman went and talked to Channing Robertson, a Stanford professor who’d helped Holmes start Theranos. Robertson told Grossman there was no technical risk associated with the company — the only risk was making sure consumers had a good experience. He also said that the technology was so advanced that even if it fell into the hands of competitors, it would take them years to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HnAozK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grossman’s blood test gave us a peek behind the curtain at Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7hXoC"&gt;Grossman toured the HQ. He toured the clinical lab, where he saw only Theranos analyzers and none of the modified third-party devices the company was actually using. He toured the manufacturing facility. He even went to a Palo Alto Walgreens to get his blood drawn — a venous draw, one that took more than a day to get results. Balwani told Grossman that was because his doctor ordered an unusual test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owxRmp"&gt;Grossman’s blood test gave us a peek behind the curtain at Theranos. The prosecution showed an email to Theranos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;whistleblower Adam Rosendorff &lt;/a&gt;and some other workers in Theranos’ lab, asking them to speed up work on a “VIP” test — Grossman’s. “This is on the Immulite, right?” an employee replied, referencing a competitor’s machine. That was confirmed by another employee. (Grossman said in court that if he’d known competitors’ devices were being used, he would have asked even more questions of Theranos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iWnPs"&gt;So Grossman decided to invest. Sure, Theranos had been weirdly secretive and security-focused when he’d visited, but Grossman shrugged that off. Yes, it was odd that he’d been discouraged from talking to Theranos’ partners, but he shrugged that off too — hadn’t a Stanford professor told him the tech was amazing? Wasn’t Walgreens touting it in their quarterly earnings calls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J8eILq"&gt;And now, of course, one of his investments underpins a count of wire fraud against Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spider-Man: No Way Home’s latest trailer brings back all the bad guys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fqimi6AN7ndTuRIq13Iau3NcJ9w=/0x9:1150x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152399/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_5.35.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SZbcM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA"&gt;The latest trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, bringing with it some big surprises for Spider-Man’s latest MCU outing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRPZIY"&gt;If you’re trying to go into the latest adventure of the web-slinging hero without spoilers, you’ll probably want to skip hitting play here (or reading the rest of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCR0KK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73BP60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;As revealed in the first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; picks up right where &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; left off: with Peter Parker’s secret identity as Spider-Man revealed to the world, something that Peter tries to enlist Doctor Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) assistance in rectifying. Magical multiverse hijinks ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWdKJs"&gt;Things appear to go wrong, though, resulting in appearances from a plethora of Spidey rogues from Sony’s past Spider-Man franchises (before the MCU was ever around), including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), and &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Electro (Jamie Foxx). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTXezy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements don’t break Face ID in iOS 15.2 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11MpV1qW74-jkRK0vySgc-cvBw=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152317/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqHPpW"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that it would be rolling out a software update to iPhone 13 devices to make it easier to replace their screens without breaking Face ID, but it didn’t specify when that update might arrive. Fortunately, we may not have to wait long, as repair experts say they have successfully completed the easier screen swaps on iPhone 13 handsets running the iOS 15.2 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBnMV"&gt;Before the update, keeping Face ID working after swapping the screens also required moving over a microcontroller from the original phone to the new one. Doing so is a complex process, and having to do it for every iPhone 13 that needs a new screen could make things difficult for indie repair shops. (You can read all about the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786274%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But on an iPhone 13 loaded with the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9oFrfXq5o"&gt;still worked&lt;/a&gt; after a screen swap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; without having to bring over the microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NreKtM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f9oFrfXq5o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTblbM"&gt;Although Face ID still works, the screen-swapped iPhone 13 does show an “Important Display Message” warning that the device can’t verify is the screen is a “genuine Apple part” — even though &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says the screen actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a genuine part. This isn’t entirely out of the norm for Apple, though, which shows similar warnings on some iPhones following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805744/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-ios-safety-statement-unauthorized"&gt;battery replacements&lt;/a&gt; from unauthorized repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xG67U"&gt;Apple didn’t reply when we asked if it could confirm that iOS 15.2 is the version that will allow for the easier screen replacements when it’s released publicly. But given that the less-intensive screen swaps appear to work on the beta, it seems likely they will work in the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rAm0Au"&gt;Paramount Plus is grabbing back its &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series from Netflix, where it’s been streaming to international viewers for three seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dw8uZ"&gt;The series lived on Paramount Plus (fka CBS All Access) for US viewers and on Canada’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel, but the move will bring old and future seasons of the series under a single streaming umbrella for folks outside of those regions. Season 4 of &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-season-4-trailer-premiere-date-1235084921/"&gt;had previously been set&lt;/a&gt; to debut on Paramount Plus in the US, CTV Sci-Fi Channel, and on Netflix elsewhere on November 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ssWu"&gt;The show will leave Netflix at 12AM PT in regions where it had previously been available to stream. (It will remain on Bell Media’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel and stream on the Crave in Canada.) All seasons of the show will become available to international viewers in 2022, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/star-trek-discovery-netflix-deal-paramount-viacomcbs-1234875466/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="07CZqw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To our international &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekDiscovery?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarTrekDiscovery&lt;/a&gt; fans... &lt;a href="https://t.co/QATQzHxepK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QATQzHxepK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrekOnPPlus/status/1460714359588483074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z337vx"&gt;The plan to grab back some of its IP comes as the company focuses on a wider international expansion heading into next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRSDPt"&gt;“As we rapidly expand our global streaming footprint, we are bringing more of our top titles home to ViacomCBS for Paramount+ markets around the world,” Kelly Day, president of streaming for ViacomCBS Networks International, said in a statement. “We have a strong global and local content pipeline that positions us for success across our regions, and repatriating beloved series like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; for Paramount+ is another step forward as we bring fans more must-watch series worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCfpdS"&gt;According to the company, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will become available internationally to Paramount Plus subscribers in 2022 in regions where the service is currently available. Paramount Plus is currently available in 25 countries but says it plans to expand to 45 markets by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nNqgj"&gt;Uniting — for the most part — its &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series in a single hub for international audiences doesn’t quite fix the fractured state of the sprawling Star Trek library, however. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; will still be on Amazon for streamers outside Canada and the US. As stated, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will continue to stream on non-Paramount Plus channels in Canada. And lastly, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; will stay on Amazon outside of Latin America, Canada, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Arm acquisition undergoes more scrutiny by the UK government </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkI3LzuxCAe53S-o5F9sVD12dpA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152004/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkhc4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s $40 billion proposed acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of the Brtish chip designer, Arm, will undergo an even more in-depth investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/nvidias-arm-takeover-faces-uk-national-security-inquiry.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A notice on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/proposed-acquisition-of-arm-limited-by-nvidia-corporation-phase-1-report-and-phase-2-reference-under-section-454-of-the-enterprise-act-2002"&gt;UK government’s website&lt;/a&gt; confirms that Nadine Dorries, the UK’s Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, ordered the CMA to launch a Phase 2 investigation. The probe will take place over a 24-week period and will scrutinize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;potential national security risks&lt;/a&gt; and competition concerns associated with the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovsKsd"&gt;The CMA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634379/nvidia-arm-aquisition-delay-uk-phase-2-investigation"&gt;completed its Phase 1 probe&lt;/a&gt; in August — which you can now read in its entirety as a &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033732/GOV.UK_-_NVIDIA_Arm_-_CMA_Report_to_DCMS__Web_Accessible_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; — with CMA’s chief executive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-finds-competition-concerns-with-nvidia-s-purchase-of-arm"&gt;Andrea Coscelli commenting that&lt;/a&gt; “NVIDIA controlling Arm could create real problems for NVIDIA’s rivals by limiting their access to key technologies.” It recommended a Phase 2 investigation at the time, so Dorries’ choice to take the next steps doesn’t come as much of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KNb1bu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially gave its acquisition of ARM a March 2022 deadline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvgXZq"&gt;In addition to the CMA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"&gt;the EU launched its own investigation into the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; late last month, on the account that acquiring Arm may give Nvidia an unfair edge. This will likely drag out the deal even more, and that doesn’t include the possible investigations that may be conducted by the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95h89j"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang initially gave the company’s acquisition of Arm a March 2022 deadline, but with regulators closely scrutinizing the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;he admitted that it may take much longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;Arm was bought out by the Japanese company SoftBank&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 in a deal valued at $31 billion. The chip designer is considered neutral territory in the world of tech, as it licenses out schematics to tech giants such as Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm, which then manufacture and install the hardware in their own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4qK2R"&gt;Since Nvidia actively competes with many of Arm’s customers, regulators worry that Nvidia may put other companies at a disadvantage, possibly preventing Arm from designing more powerful chips for Nvidia’s competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; possess the same fear — Nvidia has the power to choose how Arm makes designs, what companies it sells them to, and at what price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keAKiU"&gt;Not only could an anti-competitive outcome like this affect Nvidia’s competitors, but it would also impact consumers. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has already made it difficult to buy certain items, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;new graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, and if Nvidia decides to use Arm to give itself special treatment, the chips that are available might have worse performance or cost more than they already do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reintroduces shared rides with a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCjwVJW7Da3aGqgfXJiUBGDtypM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151970/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cWvUoh"&gt;Uber is bringing back shared rides with a new name: UberX Share. The revamped carpooling product is available first as a pilot in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPzot"&gt;Uber suspended its Uber Pool carpooling feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183276/uber-uberpool-suspension-coronavirus-us-canada-carpool-pandemic"&gt;in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company promised earlier this month that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764246/uber-pool-prices-shared-ride-covid-earnings"&gt;planned to bring shared rides back&lt;/a&gt;. Uber prices have gone way up recently, so a carpooling option allows the company to offer cheaper costs that could make taking an Uber a more popular transportation option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2N7ZD"&gt;On an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fuberx-share%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UberX Share ride&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll only ride with one other person (in addition to the driver) during your trip. Everyone in the car must wear a mask, even if they are all vaccinated. UberX Share rides will have a 5 percent discount, and you’ll get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fhow-it-works%2Fuber-cash%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DUber%2520Cash%2520can%2520be%2520used%2Cfor%2520orders%2520with%2520Uber%2520Eats.%26text%3DYes%252C%2520you%2520can%2520pay%2520with%2Cis%2520available%2520in%2520select%2520markets.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber Cash&lt;/a&gt; if another person is picked up during your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gYcpYQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;609 days later, shared rides are back in the US—and better than before&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ve built a new experience that’s more efficient and sustainable for riders, drivers, and the cities we serve&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UberX Share starts piloting in Miami today! &lt;a href="https://t.co/P1HM7htO9a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/P1HM7htO9a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Macdonald (@andrewgordonmac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgordonmac/status/1460669562312138760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw33uG"&gt;It’s unclear when UberX Share might expand, and the company said Tuesday it didn’t have anything additional to share about future rollout plans to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjwyfF"&gt;Uber rival Lyft brought back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578402/lyft-shared-rides-rideshare-back"&gt;shared rides in July&lt;/a&gt; after also suspending the feature in March 2020. Similar to Uber, only one other rider can join, and everyone &lt;a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/e/articles/115013078848-Lyft-Shared-rides-for-riders"&gt;must wear a mask&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft’s shared rides launched in Chicago, Denver, and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate confirms Google critic to lead DOJ antitrust division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Holds Nominations For U.S. Judicial Positions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qMp86snPI4Er8x0M4UPcObr1CC4=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151851/1345165235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AC6tZT"&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Google critic and competition lawyer Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, marking yet another progressive win in antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQf7kb"&gt;Kanter has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. Now that he’s been confirmed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585590/joe-biden-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-lina-khan-tim-wu-google"&gt;Kanter will lead several Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; competition cases against big tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0xdO"&gt;“Throughout his career, Kanter has [sic] been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,” the White House said in a statement over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKa4yl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYsumk"&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies like Facebook and Google. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the Senate confirmed Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Khan first rose to prominence as a law student after authoring a 2017 paper titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The paper argued that the government needs new antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive conduct in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05OtEd"&gt;The FTC has the authority to sue companies for anti-competitive behavior, and the agency is currently enmeshed in litigation against Facebook and Google. Kanter aligns closely with Khan and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;progressive antitrust scholar Tim Wu&lt;/a&gt;, who currently sits on the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SixUj5"&gt;Kanter’s history of leading lawsuits against big tech companies in the past has led to calls from critics for him to recuse himself from the DOJ’s active antitrust cases against Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6W889"&gt;“Given that Kanter is famous for representing Microsoft and Yelp and attacking Google, Kanter will raise questions about his ability to impartially enforce the law against tech businesses, just like FTC Chair Khan,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq1oh5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK7Arw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal’s new contracts will make it more difficult for artists to rerecord their work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 47" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsc0qxhoHIP3lKOLYP2MVuOBefk=/524x361:2424x1628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151692/1236560335.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhinUA"&gt;Universal Music Group is modifying its contracts to extend the period in which an artist can rerecord their music, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-taylor-swift-rerecorded-her-red-album-universal-reworked-contracts-11636741201"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The move comes after the success of Taylor Swift’s rerecorded albums and the music label’s effort to gain more rights from artists who decide to rerecord their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sh3P"&gt;Before, a standard contract stated that an artist couldn’t rerecord their work five years after their last delivered recording or two years after the end of their contract term, whichever is later. The new format increases the time after recording to seven years and the time after a contract term to five years, &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDIcZA"&gt;Swift owns the music composition rights to her music. Her first label, Big Machine Records, sold the rights to her master recordings (the final version we hear) to an investment firm in 2019. Her masters were reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/scooter-braun-sells-taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-1234832080/"&gt;later sold to an investment fund&lt;/a&gt; for over $300 million in 2020, which was also around the time she was free to rerecord her music. So far, she has rerecorded and released her 2008 album &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;/em&gt; and her 2012 album &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, with “(Taylor’s Version)” in the album title to distinguish ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwoTRX"&gt;Music labels have gradually been losing their grip on their power and influence on the music industry with the rise of music streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify. One impact of music streaming platforms in the industry is a change in the way business is done because artists can release and promote their own work without the help of a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fon7Mj"&gt;This change will prevent an artist from creating competition during the recording’s biggest monetization period within the first 10 years, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBpyD"&gt;Universal’s change is likely to set a standard for other recording companies. With artists who are wanting to start out, this is another consideration for how they interact with labels and their work. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQwQ02"&gt;Four years after Ford was reportedly considering buying Lucid Motors, the EV startup is now worth more than the Detroit automaker. Lucid Motors’ market capitalization passed Ford’s on Tuesday, one day after the startup reported its &lt;a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-lucid"&gt;first quarterly financial results&lt;/a&gt; as a publicly traded company and just a few weeks after it started shipping its luxury electric sedan, the Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0roY9M"&gt;Lucid Motors has a comparatively long history for an EV startup as it was founded in 2007 as a battery company called Atieva. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;a 2016 pivot to making an electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, Lucid Motors found itself running out of money at a time when others were starting to take off. One of the options it turned to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;was a potential Ford acquisition&lt;/a&gt;. From a July 2017 report in &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AvpXUJ"&gt;Lucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford’s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: “The bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D. They came back and said they wanted to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="naaTTy"&gt;That never happened, though, and Lucid Motors ultimately treaded water until striking a massive deal with Saudi Arabia, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;now owns a majority of the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford, for its part, was able to work out a pretty sizable investment of its own into Rivian — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768373/go-read-this-gm-deal-ford-rivian-fell-apart"&gt;a deal it swiped out from under rival General Motors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyrySg"&gt;In the years since, Lucid Motors spent billions of dollars of Saudi Arabia’s money getting the Air EV ready for production. The startup revealed Monday that it has lost more than $1.5 billion this year alone in the mad dash to start shipping the Air to customers and has spent some $5 billion across its lifetime.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7Patx"&gt;The stock market — which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;extremely hot on electric vehicle startups lately&lt;/a&gt; — rewarded that effort Tuesday, pushing Lucid Motors’ valuation to nearly $90 billion. Ford finished the day at about $79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyiMuK"&gt;Lucid Motors still has a lot of work ahead. The startup is still building out its new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and says it plans to build 20,000 Air sedans in 2022 before adding an electric SUV to its lineup at the end of the following year. It will be challenging work, to be sure. Today, at least, the market treated that to-do list as pretty much pure upside.&lt;/p&gt;
