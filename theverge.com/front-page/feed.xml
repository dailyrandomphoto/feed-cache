    <title>Nearly a thousand Activision Blizzard employees slam its response to harassment suit</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fInCj1"&gt;Hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees have signed a letter (published by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22594765/activision-blizzard-open-letter-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/over-1-000-activision-blizzard-employees-sign-letter-co-1847364340"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;that rebukes the company’s response to California’s allegations that Activision Blizzard has a discriminatory work culture and issues with sexual harassment. The company’s response to the lawsuit, which paints &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;an extremely upsetting picture&lt;/a&gt; of its culture and how women are treated there, has largely been to deny the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSHnll"&gt;In their letter, which can be read below, the employees say that response “creates a company atmosphere that disbelieves victims,” and they call for “immediate corrections” from the company’s top leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxeSWh"&gt;The letter was written in response to both public and internal statements made by Activision Blizzard and its executives in response to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the company’s public response to the lawsuit was to call the state’s suit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.” The employees’ letter also calls on executive Fran Townsend to step down from her role as sponsor for the company’s women’s network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;after she sent an email that claimed&lt;/a&gt; the lawsuit painted an “untrue picture” of the company’s culture and called it “meritless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Clb1R6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22594765/activision-blizzard-open-letter-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the letter has gotten over 800 signatures, with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-supporting-labor-lawsuit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;putting the number&lt;/a&gt; at “nearly 1,000.” &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/node/33966/html"&gt;Activision Blizzard reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had around 9,500 employees in December 2020, so either of those estimates would likely put the count north of 8 percent of the company. Activision Blizzard didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpHq4S"&gt;The letter can be read in full below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9cSb1x"&gt;To the Leaders of Activision Blizzard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KlJB4"&gt;We, the undersigned, agree that the statements from Activision Blizzard, Inc. and their legal counsel regarding the DFEH lawsuit, as well as the subsequent internal statement from Frances Townsend, are abhorrent and insulting to all that we believe our company should stand for. To put it clearly and unequivocally, our values as employees are not accurately reflected in the words and actions of our leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9XHuY"&gt;We believe these statements have damaged our ongoing quest for equality inside and outside of our industry. Categorizing the claims that have been made as “distorted, and in many cases false” creates a company atmosphere that disbelieves victims. It also casts doubt on our organizations’ ability to hold abusers accountable for their actions and foster a safe environment for victims to come forward in the future. These statements make it clear that our leadership is not putting our values first. Immediate corrections are needed from the highest level of our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIES1x"&gt;Our company executives have claimed that actions will be taken to protect us, but in the face of legal action — and the troubling official responses that followed — we no longer trust that our leaders will place employee safety above their own interests. To claim this is a “truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit,” while seeing so many current and former employees speak out about their own experiences regarding harassment and abuse, is simply unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZRb6K"&gt;We call for official statements that recognize the seriousness of these allegations and demonstrate compassion for victims of harassment and assault. We call on Frances Townsend to stand by her word to step down as Executive Sponsor of the ABK Employee Women’s Network as a result of the damaging nature of her statement. We call on the executive leadership team to work with us on new and meaningful efforts that ensure employees — as well as our community — have a safe place to speak out and come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7qEgq"&gt;We stand with all our friends, teammates, and colleagues, as well as the members of our dedicated community, who have experienced mistreatment or harassment of any kind. We will not be silenced, we will not stand aside, and we will not give up until the company we love is a workplace we can all feel proud to be a part of again. We will be the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Intel has a new architecture roadmap and a plan to retake its chipmaking crown in 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcVucUy3dS9QKGkS6AFVp0p_lzw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635504/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Leban5"&gt;Intel is rethinking how it releases — and brands — its semiconductor innovations, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced today at the company’s Intel Accelerated webcast. The announcement includes the broad strokes of the next half-decade of Intel’s processor roadmap, new chip and packaging technologies, and a promise of an “annual cadence of innovation,” with the ultimate goal of seeing Intel retake its leadership in the processor space by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUGAKD"&gt;Future Intel products (starting as early as its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;12th Gen Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt; chips later this year) will no longer use the nanometer-based node nomenclature that both it and the rest of the chipmaking industry has used for years. Instead, Intel is debuting a new naming scheme that it says will provide “a more accurate view of process nodes across the industry” and how Intel’s products fit into that landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZKWhu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel rebrands its node naming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTlOZ7"&gt;How that works in practice is that those new third-generation 10nm chips will be referred to as “Intel 7,” instead of getting some 10nm-based name (like last year’s 10nm SuperFin chips). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bc0GEY"&gt;At first glance, it sounds a lot like a cheap marketing tactic designed to make Intel’s upcoming 10nm chips look more competitive next to products from AMD, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;already on TSMC’s 7nm node&lt;/a&gt;, or Apple’s 5nm M1 chips. And while that’s technically true, it’s not as unfair of a comparison as it necessarily looks. In modern semiconductors, node names don’t actually refer to the size of a transistor on a chip: thanks to advances like 3D packaging technologies and the physical realities of semiconductor design, that hasn’t been the case since 1997 (&lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/296154-how-are-process-nodes-defined"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;ExtremeTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6xgvP"&gt;And from a technical perspective, Intel’s 10nm chips &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; broadly on par with “7nm” branded hardware from competitors like TSMC or Samsung, using similar production technologies and offering comparable transistor density. That’s something that translates to commercial hardware, too: we’ve already seen that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Intel’s current 10nm chips&lt;/a&gt; are still competitive with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;AMD’s cutting-edge 7nm Ryzen chips&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgeY7v"&gt;All that is to say that Intel’s rebranding here isn’t entirely unfair to see, even if it does make it harder to parse when those bigger “node” change advances are happening with the new nomenclature. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lIWakE-ylqzCe_8uUPLBL9w9QxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741569/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_4.45.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Intel’s updated roadmap and node naming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8lO9Pv"&gt;Here’s a look at Intel’s new roadmap and what it all actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpRFVG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Intel 7 &lt;/strong&gt;is the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;new name for what would have been Intel’s third-generation 10nm technology and the successor to Intel’s 10nm SuperFin (aka Intel’s second-generation 10nm chips, found most notably in its 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips). Intel says that the new Intel 7 hardware will offer approximately 10 percent to 15 percent improvements in performance-per-watt compared to the previous generation — or, as is always the case, improved power efficiency and battery life should hardware manufacturers prefer to keep performance the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLinn5"&gt;The first Intel 7-based products will show up as early as this year, with the already previewed Alder Lake chips coming at the end of 2021 for consumer products, and the upcoming Sapphire Rapids chips in 2022 for data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ3AzC"&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Intel 4 &lt;/strong&gt;is the architecture formally known as Intel’s 7nm process, which Intel infamously was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;forced to delay out to 2023&lt;/a&gt; last summer following manufacturing issues. Originally planned for 2021, it’s the next major jump in technology for Intel, using EUV (extreme ultraviolet) technology — something already utilized by Samsung and TSMC’s 5nm node products, for comparison. It’ll still use the same broad FinFET transistor architecture that Intel’s been using since 2011. Thanks to all those improvements, Intel 4 is expected to feature a transistor density of about 200-250 million transistors per mm², compared to about 171.30 million transistors per mm² on TSMC’s current 5nm node. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8N9en"&gt;Intel says that Intel 4 will offer an approximately 20 percent jump in performance-per-watt while cutting down on overall area. Production is set for the second half of 2022, with the first Intel 4 products planned for 2023 (Meteor Lake for consumer products, and Granite Rapids for data center).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udA1R8"&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Intel 3&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;set for manufacturing in the second half of 2023, is the new name for what would have been a second-generation 7nm product under Intel’s previous naming scheme. Like Intel 4, it’s still a FinFET product, although Intel says it’ll offer additional optimizations and use of EUV for roughly an 18 percent increase in performance-per-watt compared to Intel 4.  No release date or product names for Intel 3 chips have been announced yet, but presumably, they won’t be available until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dvYYzF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Intel 20A&lt;/strong&gt; is the name for the next generation of Intel technologies that, under the old scheme, would have been the architecture following the formerly branded 7nm node. It’s also the most substantial announcement that Intel made today, technologically speaking, one that will see Intel debut its first new transistor architecture since FinFET in 2011, called “RibbonFET.” The new architecture will mark Intel’s first &lt;a href="https://blog.lamresearch.com/finfets-give-way-to-gate-all-around/"&gt;gate-all-around transistor&lt;/a&gt;, a fundamentally new transistor technology for the company that promises greater transistor density and smaller sizes. Additionally, 20A will see the introduction of “PowerVia,” a new technology that allows for wafers to be powered from the back of the chip, instead of requiring power to be rounded to the front. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ho9d8Mp-GFyF76KbsJ71snUasKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741572/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_4.46.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A closer look at the coming updates for Intel 20A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mB4Eqx"&gt;The “20A” in the title is meant to evoke the “Ångstrom era” of semiconductor design — an Ångstrom being a unit of measurement smaller than nanometer. (20Å = 2nm, although, like the other rebranded Intel names above, Intel 20A doesn’t refer to a specific measurement on the products themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQWXSs"&gt;Intel’s 20A isn’t expected to ramp until 2024, and, like Intel 3, it doesn’t have any formally announced release date or products yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="YCo9T9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Intel 18A&lt;/strong&gt; is the farthest in the future piece of Intel’s roadmap and will feature the second generation of Intel’s RibbotFET technology for “another major jump in transistor performance.” Intel says that Intel 18A is in development for “early 2025,” and that it expects this generation of technology to re-establish its semiconductor leadership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="knRUuU"&gt;In addition to all of its process roadmap news, Intel also announced two major updates to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18137401/intel-foveros-3d-chip-stacking-10nm-roadmap-future"&gt;Foveros chip-stacking packaging technologies&lt;/a&gt; (the second-generation of which is set to debut in Intel 4’s Meteor Lake in 2023.) Foveros chip stacking combines several hardware elements into a single die, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;Intel’s Lakefield chips&lt;/a&gt;, which pile together five CPU cores, an integrated GPU, and DRAM into a compact stack to save internal space compared to a traditional design. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Al-j4ZeDcm5HnupYHYCjoC6jkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741574/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_4.47.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw8oDG"&gt;Foveros Omni will allow for more variety in stacked chips by making it easier to mix-and-match tiles, regardless of their specific size — for example, allowing for a base tile that’s smaller than the top tile in a stack. And Foveros Direct will allow for direct copper-to-copper bonding between components, reducing resistance and decreasing bump pitches. Both of the new Foveros technologies are planned for production in 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cwTBDN"&gt;
&lt;p id="LoTJmF"&gt;Intel’s new names may help the company recontextualize its current and future products more accurately against its competition, but the fact remains that Intel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; behind. Even accepting that the Intel 7 is on par with 7nm products from other foundries, those foundries are already past their 7nm chips and on to 5nm hardware. Which means that the companies that rely on those external foundries — like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and virtually every other major tech company — can still get chips that are more advanced than Intel’s best work. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s superlative M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;already use 5nm chips from TSMC&lt;/a&gt; — and handily outpace Intel’s comparable products. &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-6000-rembrandt-apus-feature-6nm-zen-3-cpu-cores-up-to-12-rdna-2-gpu-compute-units/"&gt;AMD is rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be working on 5nm Zen 4 processors for as early as 2022, too, which could offer similarly concerning competition for Intel from its already encroaching competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gE4xH7"&gt;Even with the ambitious, annual cadence for its roadmap, Intel is playing from behind; it doesn’t expect to fully catch up to the rest of the industry until Intel 20A in 2024. And it doesn’t expect to reclaim leadership in the semiconductor business until 2025 with Intel 18A. And all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; assumes that Intel doesn’t hit any more delays or manufacturing snags like the ones that held up both its 10nm and 7nm processes (which arguably put the company in its current situation in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWy5Fl"&gt;After years of setbacks, though, it’s clear that the revitalized Intel isn’t going down without a fight. But the next few years will see whether its efforts are enough. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla finally made a profit without the help of emission credits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVQMeCFb-PDTz9gywJL5Mswj60Q=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635391/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0sPCO"&gt;Tesla sold enough cars and energy products to turn a profit &lt;em&gt;even without&lt;/em&gt; counting the sale of emissions credits to other automakers — a milestone for the company. This was the eighth profitable quarter in a row for Tesla, but the first where it can truly say it’s a profitable automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvJVKU"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf"&gt;shared Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it logged a $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter of 2021, with $354 million of that coming from credit sales. The rest came from automotive sales, as well as a boost in energy storage sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIeyX"&gt;Tesla pulled this off despite taking a loss of $23 million on its big Bitcoin bet (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;something that had helped it to a profit last quarter&lt;/a&gt;), a delayed rollout of the revamped Model S sedan and Model X SUV, and the global semiconductor shortage. All told, Tesla generated $11.9 billion in revenue in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmBIS0"&gt;The Model 3 sedan and Model Y compact SUV dominated Tesla’s sales again, proving once more that there’s a market for more affordable electric cars. Tesla delivered over 200,000 Model 3s and Model Ys in the quarter, compared to the 1,895 Model S sedans sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNeY06"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-0nEvz" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/0nEvz/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(billions in USD; green indicates profitable quarter)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0nEvz/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla's quarterly revenue and profit/loss" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-0nEvz");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-0nEvz");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1kHwrF"&gt;It’s clear that the Model Y’s initial success has been enough to give the company a boost, but it’s hard to say exactly how big that boost is since Tesla doesn’t break out sales by individual model. Same with China. Tesla doesn’t break out sales by country, but it has been delivering locally made cars from its factory outside Shanghai for more than a year, and that has helped the company continue to grow its business. In fact, Tesla said Monday that it considers the factory in China to be its “primary vehicle export hub.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giy5Nt"&gt;Tesla will have even more capacity when it starts making vehicles at the two factories it’s building in Texas and Germany. While the latter has been slow-going thanks to environmental violations and red tape, Tesla’s Texas factory is being built nearly as fast as the one the company constructed in China. These other factories not only lower the cost to selling cars in a given region, they also make up for the fact that Tesla’s original factory in California has been pretty much operating at its limit for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hhnz3v"&gt;It’s the scale of that expansion into a truly global automaker that has finally allowed Tesla to get into the black even without the aid of regulatory credits — something Tesla needed to prove it can do considering the automakers it’s spent years selling these credits to are now creating electric vehicles and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-emissions-credits-sales-profit-stellantis-fiat-chrysler-2021-5#:~:text=Fiat%20Chrysler%20agreed%20to%20purchase,European%20regulators%20on%20its%20own."&gt;will no longer need to buy regulatory offsets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6genc"&gt;Growing the automotive business to a global scale has come at the expense of some other projects, though, as Tesla shared Monday that it has once again delayed the launch of its Semi truck until 2022. Tesla has said that the vehicle is basically ready for production, but that making the trucks at scale would cannibalize the availability of the company’s next-generation 4680 battery cells — which it needs for the Cybertruck and the Model Y that will be built in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5SIZV"&gt;Tesla also gave an update on the development of that 4680 cell, which was announced last year at the company’s Battery Day event. Tesla said “substantial progress has been made” but that there is “work ahead of us before we can achieve volume production,” especially with regards to refining the manufacturing process for the cells. The company said it has, however, successfully crash-tested the new design for its vehicles where these cells will be built into the structural frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa8u71"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsjDb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkMUvv2TJUV9INCLobptUX5d9lI=/2x0:4499x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/Samsung_Crystal_TU_7000_series_UHD_TV_Lifestyle_Image.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 55-inch Samsung Crystal TU-7000 is on sale at Best Buy for $450. | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many summer sales in full swing, now might be the best time of the year (or, at least until the fall) to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MLgUIb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%2F919937738%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get it for around $800 (normally $950).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_yIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1460806%26clickid%3DyIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $878&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also pick up the 65- or 75-inch configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Although its price isn’t as low as it was during Amazon Prime Day, you can still pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its typical sale price and $100 off the initial MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 55-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $479. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model at Best Buy for $420&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can currently get the 50-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$450 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 less than the usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $300, depending on the size. The popular 55-inch model is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555063-REG%2Flg_oled55bxpua_bxpua_55_class_hdr.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOgU3ox9wsfBFjLRJVHH3TWdndzXKhfL4blfPMcuIgQPfk8De4iHqNxoCh80QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,297 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-55-39-39-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-tv-oled55bxpua%2F-%2FA-52328755&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,300 at Target&lt;/a&gt;, and basically the same price at other major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NqbUhw"&gt;The 2020 Sony A8H 4K OLED doesn’t support HDMI 2.1 or variable refresh rate — meaning it's not a great fit for next-gen gaming — but it’s hard to ignore given it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084KQFNBX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently $1,298 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s picture processing is as phenomenal as the OLED panel itself, and can bring out both natural colors and the blackest of blacks. It also supports AirPlay 2 and HomeKit, as well as Amazon Alexa and Android TV, the latter of which allows you to install and browse your favorite entertainment apps with ease. First-rate HDR performance, four HDMI ports with ARC support, a 120Hz refresh rate round out the A8H’s solid feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="buq7W8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,497 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747329393993355564#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,900 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,850 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $1,600. You can also pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for $1,397 at the same retailers (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the 65-, 77-, and 83-inch variants. These aren’t the largest discounts we’ve seen on the C1 in recent months, however, there’s no telling when we’ll see another significant price drop on LG’s flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x9RwhV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung starts shipping its most ambitious TV lineup in years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;In terms of discounts, we don’t often see them on the QN90A. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747326766300148032#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both offering the 55-inch model for about $1,500, the second-best price we’ve seen on the stunning QLED. There are also varying discounts available on the 50-, 65-, 75-inch, and 85-inch configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gR7Wz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wy7BiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OGJPin"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to responsibly get rid of the stuff you’ve decluttered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mqKImZk3EO_Xs_tqOs8Tvi_-nA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635339/jbareham_190130_grid_four_up_01_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4Liij"&gt;If you’ve been at home for over a year, you may have taken the opportunity to go through all those tech devices, books, old clothes, and other detritus that has piled up over the years. Or perhaps you’ve upgraded a bunch of your possessions recently and have suddenly realized you don’t have room for the stuff you’ve replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvET57"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you’ve got bags of tech, clothing, books, and other stuff that you need to get rid of, you want to get rid of them responsibly. Where do you go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEhTDO"&gt;As you must know by now, just dumping it isn’t an option. Reusing and recycling old and unneeded stuff has become an important aspect of the push to preserve the world’s environment. Many states and urban areas are mandating the recycling of tech, metals, paper goods, or other substances, but even if you live in an area where the law doesn’t require it, you probably don’t want to add more to the world’s trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ucSlT"&gt;The problem is finding how and where you can get rid of your stuff with the greatest advantage to you and the least amount of damage to the environment. This may have been more difficult than usual over the last year or so, because many resources for recycling have been suspended during the pandemic, and they may be slow in coming back.  However, there are still a number of online services that can help you figure out how to responsibly get rid of things — and possibly make some money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRMRG6"&gt;Here are some sites to check out, depending on what you want to dispose of and how you want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C0RGyO"&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="old phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hw6jo7ImmGTBO85xd9o0cUzIno0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8402935/DSC01879__1__2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eeugvy"&gt;Planning to buy a new phone or laptop? Before you make the purchase, check out any manufacturer trade-in deals that are available for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023686/macbook-pad-mac-apple-trade-in-program-how-to-value-swappa"&gt;Macs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17936900/pixel-2-xl-trade-in-value-how-to-sell-used-best-deal-swappa"&gt;Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZc2ek"&gt;If you don’t like the offer from the vendor, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21063647/how-to-sell-iphone-trade-in-stores-apple-att-verizon-swappa-value"&gt;sell your tech&lt;/a&gt;. There are online vendors that will take your used device off your hands and give you something for it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Decluttr&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will give you a tentative quote on your phone or tech. (It also takes CDs, DVDs, games, books, and Lego.) You can also sell through a service like &lt;a href="https://swappa.com/"&gt;Swappa&lt;/a&gt;, which charges the buyer, not the seller, a fee (but the seller does have to pay PayPal’s transaction fee). &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2TnKnD9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; also has a trade-in program, although payment will come in the form of a gift card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wCps5M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sell your old iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21063647/how-to-sell-iphone-trade-in-stores-apple-att-verizon-swappa-value"},{"title":"How to trade in your MacBook, macOS desktop, iPhone, or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023686/macbook-pad-mac-apple-trade-in-program-how-to-value-swappa"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rALMPI"&gt;You can also give it to charity. There are several programs that give computers to people or organizations that need them. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.computerswithcauses.org/laptop-donation.htm"&gt;Computers with Causes&lt;/a&gt; passes tech on to individuals who need them; &lt;a href="https://worldcomputerexchange.org/"&gt;World Computer Exchange&lt;/a&gt; sends refurbished desktop and laptop computers to schools, libraries, community centers, and universities in developing countries; and &lt;a href="https://www.globetops.com/"&gt;Globetops&lt;/a&gt; lets you choose who will get your refurbished laptop using online descriptions (or you can just donate your tech and let Globetops decide). As with any charitable institution, it’s a good idea to check them out before giving. (There are several charity info sites online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CMYA0"&gt;If you’ve got tech that is so old that nobody wants it, then it’s time to dispose of it — in an environmentally conscious way, of course. In fact, if you just throw away your computer or TV set, you may be breaking the law, depending on where you live. According to a 2018 article written for the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/e-waste-recycling-legislation.aspx"&gt;National Council of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, “25 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation establishing a statewide electronic waste, or e-waste, recycling program.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dP8OZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you just throw away your computer or TV set, you may be breaking the law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKueaV"&gt;If you live in an urban area, chances are there’s some kind of recycling program available (or even mandatory). In many cases, stores that sell electronics will also offer recycling (occasionally for a fee); all you have to do is bring your stuff to the store. Or you can try &lt;a href="https://search.earth911.com/"&gt;Earth911&lt;/a&gt; to find the nearest recycling center. However, always check directly with the center or store before you go there; many recycling programs may still be on hold because of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6STfng"&gt;Disposing of batteries safely can be a pain. &lt;a href="https://www.call2recycle.org/"&gt;Call2Recycle&lt;/a&gt; can help you find out where to drop off that bag of batteries you’ve been accumulating. If there aren’t any facilities within reach of your home or office, &lt;a href="https://biggreenbox.com/"&gt;BigGreenBox&lt;/a&gt; will dispose of it for you — but not for free. &lt;a href="https://biggreenbox.com/products/little-green-box1"&gt;Prices begin at $36&lt;/a&gt; for a box that will hold up to 10 pounds of batteries (which includes shipping and handling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8EUp5"&gt;Finally, if you’re still holding on to your parents’ old BlackBerry PDA or Commodore 64, you may want to see if you can donate it to a museum. There aren’t as many tech museums that accept contributions as there used to be, but if you’ve got something old and / or unusual, it’s worth a shot for the tax breaks. Both the &lt;a href="https://collections.mitmuseum.org/mit-museum-donation-offer/"&gt;MIT Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://computerhistory.org/artifact-donation-form/"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt; have forms you can fill out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5MmVel"&gt;Clothing&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xiaomi Mi 5 camera sample images - clothing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owpTAgUhsVsvXjyEpjD11vGmiAU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6198443/IMG_20160315_135242.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2HEQoj"&gt;You can divide clothing sites into three categories: ones that handle the latest stylish and expensive clothing and jewelry, ones that handle major middle-level brands, and dealers in traditional discount leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh1w3a"&gt;At the high end are consignment companies that act as go-betweens for those who want to sell designer clothing, jewelry, and other valuable objects, and those who want to buy them. Most of these, such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.therealreal.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TheRealReal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rebag.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rebag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vestiairecollective.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vestiaire Collective&lt;/a&gt;, authenticate all of the products that are sold through them and will only take recent fashions, so they are not where you go to get rid of that jacket that’s been hanging in your closet for 10 years. However, if you’re the kind of shopper who buys the latest styles every season, these may be where you want to sell and buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMax6p"&gt;A side note: if you have business clothing that you no longer wear, there are a number of organizations that accept office wear in good condition for people who are job hunting. Most of these are locally based; for example, in the NYC area, there is &lt;a href="http://bottomlessclosetnyc.org/"&gt;Bottomless Closet&lt;/a&gt; for women and &lt;a href="https://careergear.org/"&gt;Career Gear&lt;/a&gt; for men. The best way to find an organization in your area is to try charity guides such as &lt;a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/"&gt;Charity Navigator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.guidestar.org/Home.aspx"&gt;GuideStar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljKEXt"&gt;For less upscale clothing, sites like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradesy.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tradesy&lt;/a&gt; handle both upscale and mid-priced clothing, shoes, and jewelry. Tradesy takes a straightforward commission from the seller, although it will check if there is any question about the authenticity of the label. You can also try sites like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thredup.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThredUp&lt;/a&gt;, which handles thousands of major brands; you send your gently used clothing directly to the service, and if it accepts (and sells) your clothing, you can choose from cash or credit from either ThredUp or an associated retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="WgSf58"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many charities that used to accept worn or outmoded clothing have become pickier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LVEJZ"&gt;If you want to get rid of your older clothing, you may find it a bit harder than it used to be. Many charities that used to accept worn or outmoded clothing have become pickier, partly because &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42777804"&gt;the business of reselling old clothes overseas&lt;/a&gt; is waning. In addition, savvy consumers are becoming wary of the omnipresent drop-in clothing bins since many actually belong to for-profit companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC3HXQ"&gt;If you can’t make it to your local Goodwill store, one place to try is &lt;a href="https://vva.org/donate/"&gt;Vietnam Veterans of America&lt;/a&gt;. Its website will let you schedule a pickup (assuming it services your area). &lt;a href="https://givebackbox.com/index"&gt;GiveBackBox&lt;/a&gt; encourages you to use the box your new clothes were shipped in to send your old stuff (it asks that you send five or more items) to a charity; the site provides a prepaid shipping label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yQeFDm"&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwaPto8DFv_OZCx8A3FHoZtNXgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13624866/aliptak_181213_3114_8089.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGdn0"&gt;Books made of paper rather than pixels are still around, and if the piles are getting too high for your home, then you probably want to get rid of at least some of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8YDVQ"&gt;One solution is to sell your books through a site such as &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2Sgbjap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, although that can get complicated. As an individual (as opposed to a business), you have to set up a seller’s account and pay Amazon 99 cents per book. And your chances of actually selling may be slim to none; there are a lot of professional booksellers who use Amazon to get rid of extra inventory, so they will sell their books for the 99 cents plus the shipping fee, making it difficult for individuals to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhMCVG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Your chances of actually selling your books via Amazon may be slim to none&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jihdCy"&gt;You can also try popular resellers such as &lt;a href="https://www.powells.com/sell-books"&gt;Powell’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://secure.buyback.abebooks.com/"&gt;AbeBooks&lt;/a&gt;. You give them the ISBN and the condition of the book(s), and they will give you a quote. Then, you mail the books to them and reap your reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3auMJ"&gt;If you’ve got textbooks you don’t need anymore — and we all know how expensive those can get — you can try AbeBooks, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookbyte.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bookbyte&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://sellback.gotextbooks.com/"&gt;GoTextbooks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://bookscouter.com/"&gt;BookScouter&lt;/a&gt; will show you the prices offered by a variety of booksellers, along with user ratings, and you can choose which one to sell to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0F3Ri"&gt;If you just want to get rid of your books and aren’t worried about getting paid, there are sites like &lt;a href="https://services.betterworldbooks.com/individuals/"&gt;Better World Books&lt;/a&gt;, a for-profit company with drop-off boxes around the country, that uses a percentage of its earnings to promote literacy. There are also specialized organizations online that help you send books to people who need them, such as &lt;a href="http://booksforsoldiers.com/"&gt;Books for Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3d4ow"&gt;You can also go local. Libraries and used bookstores have traditionally been good ways for people to unload books they no longer want. Many libraries still take books that they can add to their collections, sell, or give away. However, it’s a good idea to go online and check with your library’s website to make sure they accept donations. (You can also go really old-fashioned and call them.) Used bookstores will usually accept books for either a small payment or for credit toward book purchases. The best way to find out if there are any in your area is to go to Google Maps and search “used bookstores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZFR3R"&gt;Finally, you can build your own library. The &lt;a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org/"&gt;Little Free Library&lt;/a&gt; site provides all the information you need to start a tiny book-lending program right outside your house (or how to find the nearest one). And if one of your neighbors has already started one, maybe you can donate to them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DC8jA9"&gt;Everything else&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGRUMuO5sqG654iLcNjY_ZUL9Uk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13725671/JBAREHAM_190130_toys_0001_2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb8w26"&gt;When you want to sell your stuff, one of the places people still think of is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. And rightfully so: this is where a lot of buyers go when they’re looking for a deal. People who sell on eBay range from one-time-only folks to professional retailers. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yj0tkl"&gt;You get up to 250 free listings a month for most product types; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after that&lt;/a&gt;, it’s 35 cents per listing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kTlNXZ"&gt;Once your item has been sold, eBay collects 12.55 percent of the final value up to $7,500 and 2.35 percent on any value over $7,500. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7NZWIm"&gt;There are several exceptions: 5.85 percent for guitars and basses (with 2.35 percent on any value over $7,500); 3 percent for heavy equipment (with 0.5 percent for values over $15,000), and 14.55 percent for movies and TV, except for vinyl records (with 2.35 percent on any value over $7,500). There are other exceptions; you can find them all &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pZ6YTy"&gt;(Note that eBay also has different fees for people who have what is called “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fselling%2Ffees-credits-invoices%2Fselling-fees%3Fid%3D4822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22594200%2Frecycle-tech-declutter-environment-green" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;managed payments&lt;/a&gt;” and for various levels of professional sellers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96NOgr"&gt;Selling on eBay takes time, effort, and patience, but it may be worth it. The best way to start is to do a quick search and see the range of prices your object (or a similar object) is selling for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8RPpY"&gt;There are other places you can sell your stuff. If you’re on Facebook, you can sell stuff using its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easiest to sell locally, where you can meet the buyer to do the exchange or arrange for a drop-off. You can also arrange to ship your item; if so, there are &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/2292899320946832"&gt;a number of rules to follow&lt;/a&gt;. Other sites that help you sell or give away items locally include &lt;a href="https://nextdoor.com/for_sale_and_free/"&gt;NextDoor&lt;/a&gt; and that old standby, &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org/"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e60e6F"&gt;For giveaways only, &lt;a href="https://www.freecycle.org/"&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; is a service that introduces local people who have stuff to other local people who want that stuff. Once you find your community Freecycle through the main site, you are instructed on how to advertise what you are giving away. Freecycle sends out your email to all of its subscribers and anyone who wants the object replies. Their email is pushed to your personal email, and after that, it’s up to you to contact the person and arrange for the giveaway. And you’ve made two people happy — you and the lucky recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVd9u16rXqTZwykb9t8sVIxO1dM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67799392/acastro_201109_4282_gamingHeadsets_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eErA8y"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the best PlayStation wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="DSU9zw"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android"&gt;Razer Barracuda X&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (the console as well as its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8mPmF"&gt;HyperX’s Cloud II Wireless is still the headset I’d recommend to most people, but Razer’s Barracuda X comes very close to beating it in terms of value. The Barracuda X costs $50 less and presents fewer roadblocks for getting great audio from a myriad of the latest platforms, thanks to its compatibility with USB-C and USB-A ports. It works on everything except for Xbox platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSTctu"&gt;In case you’re wondering where the Barracuda X fits in Razer’s vast lineup of headsets, it’s actually the start of a brand-new line. It borrows some design elements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;Razer’s Opus consumer headphones&lt;/a&gt;, but the Barracuda X focuses more on gaming. Its left ear cup hosts all of the controls and ports, including a power button, mute button, and a volume dial. It supports USB-C charging and has a 3.5mm jack for wired listening. There’s also a port for its microphone to plug into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf9FSz"&gt;Its design and USB-C charging make it stand out from Razer’s other headsets, as does the included USB-C wireless transmitter that can plug directly into a Nintendo Switch, the front of a PS5, or any PC device. Razer doesn’t list support for macOS &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Frazer-barracuda-x%2FRZ04-03800100-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve had no issues using the Barracuda X with music and video calls with its USB-C adapter plugged into a MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b8Ey3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10669983"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="medrtc"&gt;For those who don’t have USB-C ports on their devices, the Barracuda X also ships with a USB-A dongle. Unlike the Astro A20 Gen 2 below, there’s no possibility for Xbox compatibility here, unless you plug in a 3.5mm cable into your controller. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21502286/steelseries-arctis-7p-7x-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-usbc-wireless-gaming-headset"&gt;SteelSeries’ $150 Arctis 7X ships with a USB-C audio transmitter&lt;/a&gt; that’s capable of Xbox Wireless and the 2.4GHz standard for other platforms, including PlayStation. But that model isn’t easy to find in stock right now, and I don’t think it’s worth a $50 premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6G9lX"&gt;The Barracuda X is comfortable with its soft, breathable ear pads, and its headband doesn’t push down on my large-sized head. The ear cups can swivel 90 degrees, but when worn correctly, they only do so in a way that makes the padding face away from your chest. It’s a little puzzling but not a deal-breaker. The headset is well-designed overall, but its plastic build makes it feel more budget-level than the top pick above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Utbmtb"&gt;Importantly, the sound quality is great for the price. These use Razer’s TriForce drivers originally found in the BlackShark V2, but they’re a little smaller here (40mm versus 50mm in the BlackShark V2). Games and music with bass still have an appropriate amount of thump, and they’re good as a headphones replacement, so long as you aren’t expecting stellar sound quality that can rival headphones that cost hundreds more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;A few features missing from the Barracuda X that could have made it better are a game and chat audio dial and Bluetooth support. If that’s a big deal to you, the runner-up below, Astro’s A20 Gen 2, features a game and chat audio dial but not Bluetooth. A few recommended Xbox and PC-specific headsets further down the page have pulled off including both features, including Microsoft’s $100 Xbox Wireless headset and the $150 Razer Kaira Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CrALoV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8PXwc"&gt;Another runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21404415/astro-a20-gen-2-next-gen-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-wireless-headset"&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E6ruTL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mZpYW"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional $20 wireless adapter&lt;/a&gt; to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5g0vp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0hmYWQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2E4YOF"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnrAeG"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even though it comes at a $20 cost&lt;/a&gt; to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. The wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver are quite good: My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X64MTGL?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=cfbb36f4c557294387d3902c446fc9a1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQJVBN"&gt;My first impressions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Wireless-Audio-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0947HTBH8?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=d773804026e5005ad53a0fccbbd5673b&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roccat’s $150 Syn Pro Air wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt; were good. It excels in terms of sound quality and nice-to-have features like a mic sidetone dial and USB-C charging. For a company more known for its keyboards and mice, this is a surprisingly competent headset, but I was met with some major connectivity issues during testing. Namely, it sometimes takes 30 seconds or more to connect despite being near the audio transmitter. Sometimes power cycling the headset worked, but I got used to just leaving it sit there for a minute while it figured itself out. So it’s not a great headset to rely on if you need to hop in a meeting at a moment’s notice. Also, its companion software, Roccat Neon, still needs some polish. Occasionally, settings I had set in Neon didn’t take effect on the headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BF4Nbd"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset is surprisingly good for $100. It has all of the same features as our previous top pick, Razer’s Kaira Pro, but knocks $50 off the price and has a better design. Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side, or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpptY"&gt;This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller). It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LIHpB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv7vfB"&gt;Battery life is fine, but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge. While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected. Razer’s Kaira Pro makes this easier. Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYmful"&gt;Microsoft’s headset doesn’t break new ground, it just does a lot right for a reasonable price. There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model. But if you don’t want to spend more than $100, most people should be very happy with what the Xbox Wireless headset offers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FuzXKAnHOyvPWuGUIY0MkDYOf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22011747/kairapro1.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here is the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnqkBI"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OkJraT"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Corsair HS75 XB Wireless sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets, though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$85&lt;/a&gt;), Nacon RIG 700 PRO HX (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fpc-gaming%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets-and-mics%2Fproducts%2Frig-700-pro-hx-wireless-headset-with-dolby-atmos-for-xbox-series-x%2F11111809.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119&lt;/a&gt;), and the SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. All three offer satisfying comfort and passable sound quality, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they each charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fD8Ib3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; sound great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable. We’ll be on the lookout for PlayStation-specific headsets that offer up good mic quality — many console-exclusive headsets have been released for Xbox so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b6Zsn5"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oHaXwr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUH1Gy"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 + sound card&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U8pXiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer BlackShark V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xx8tXQweQhnns7y4ri_KSFBcyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20782512/blacksharkv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a USB sound card, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMekMu"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some interesting options out there — amid a lot of models you should skip outright. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be a smarter buy for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good and provides a lot of comfort, I suggest checking out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22445746/steelseries-prime-arctis-headset-wireless-plus-gaming-mouse-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis Prime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318194846724414" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $100&lt;/a&gt;, like Razer’s BlackShark V2 above, and it offers a similar amount of features (which is to say, it’s light on them, featuring a volume wheel, a mute button, and a 3.5mm jack to share audio with a nearby teammate). While Razer’s model offers slightly deeper bass and depth, the Arctis Prime’s delivery is balanced and I don’t think you’ll feel fatigued by the sound after long-term use. That goes for the comfort, too. This headset has SteelSeries’ signature bungee-style headband that keeps the plastic frame off of your head, feeling very lightweight as a result. It also upgraded the ear pads to feel more deluxe and soft. I thought Razer’s model was just a bit more comfortable to wear over long periods of time, but it’s close enough that you should just buy whichever has a design that you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0go1F"&gt;HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Air Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XML8MF6?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=1c1d6a3948296097ad1b8bcee82b7fa5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C / 3.5mm wired headset that offers a baffling amount of features for the price (including Bluetooth support for phones, touch controls, and even a microSD card slot for listening to stuff locally on-device). Like the previous model we checked out, the design is simplistic and the SXFI sound profile is fantastic to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. It’s disappointing that its sizing adjustments still don’t hold very well, and its button layout takes effort to learn and feels somewhat cobbled together. Those flaws might be worth overlooking for some people, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More ‘record-shattering’ heatwaves are on the way </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Heatwave Sets Record Temperatures In Portland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACXkbAnG3m5jz1jtQ_g-6F80qHk=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634882/1233719823.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A thermometer reading 116 degrees Fahrenheit during a heatwave in Portland, Oregon, U.S., on Monday, June 28, 2021. | Maranie Staab/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7wBufS"&gt;Even more week-long, “record-shattering” heatwaves are coming for us. From now until 2050, if greenhouse gas emissions stay high, the odds of such heatwaves happening are two to seven times greater than they were over the past few decades, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01092-9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. From 2051 to 2080, those prolonged, record-breaking events are expected to become three to 21 times more probable than they were in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bS7dp"&gt;The authors of the new study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;, used climate models to come to their conclusions. But there’s already plenty of evidence in the world around us that backs up this study and others that link climate change to more frequent and severe heatwaves. Yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; is stifling much of the US this week.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That comes after a string of extreme heat events have already smashed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;hundreds of temperature records&lt;/a&gt; across the US this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CSjqOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  High pressure aloft will contribute to an excessive heat threat across portions of the Northwest through Tuesday. High temperatures will range between 15 and 25 degrees above average in some places leading to the potential for records being tied or broken. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9XlhIsB9fR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9XlhIsB9fR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWPC/status/1419598418775887873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wnckF"&gt;While records are being broken left and right, there’s another metric to which the study calls attention. The research found that the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of warming influences how insufferable future heatwaves are. So it’s not just how much hotter the world ultimately gets compared to preindustrial times that’s scary. How &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; the planet heats up actually has a bigger impact on the heatwaves we experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujid0S"&gt;When a deadly heatwave hit the Pacific Northwest last month, we saw the dangerous whiplash that can come with a relatively cooler locale suddenly reaching boiling point. Seattle, Washington hit a record-breaking &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/uwem/2021/07/13/hottest-day-ever-in-seattle-june-__-__-2021/#:~:text=On%20June%2028%2C%202021%2C%20the,%2C%20an%20all%2Dtime%20record."&gt;108 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; on June 28th — significantly higher than its previous record of 103 degrees. And while much of the Western US was suffering through the heat that day, the Pacific Northwest saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;disproportionately high spike&lt;/a&gt; in emergency room visits in comparison. The region just wasn’t built for the heat in the way that, say, a desert community might be prepared. Washington’s roads literally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled under the extreme conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQJKAb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;City planners might want to heed advice from the authors of the new study&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2wgi3s"&gt;While the June 28th temperature record may not be the norm, city planners might want to heed advice from the authors of the new study and prepare for similar situations in the future. “The main message is that we need to prepare for more record heat events in the coming decades that shatter previous record temperatures by large margins,” lead author Erich Fischer said in an email &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/record-shattering-heat-waves-becoming-far-more-likely-study-e13fde50-45d8-4bcd-bc86-efecba6c5217.html"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLtjnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rayssa Leal’s skateboarding went viral on Vine — she just won an Olympic medal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O0E_NPKSuE4fr9M0eJCrhz0SvKQ=/0x60:962x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634673/how_its_going_leal.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zE9oY7"&gt;People may know Rayssa Leal &lt;a href="https://vine.co/v/et37leaez1r"&gt;from a Vine&lt;/a&gt; that showed her landing an incredible heelflip while dressed in a pixie outfit, but today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Olympics/status/1419531874498658304"&gt;she’s wearing something different&lt;/a&gt;: the silver medal she won for her performance in the 2021 Olympic women’s street skating event. She &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Olympics/status/1419531874498658304?s=20"&gt;also appeared&lt;/a&gt; on the Olympics official Twitter account, which posted a “how it started, how it’s going” meme featuring the 13-year-old skater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AY5W18"&gt;Leal’s &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/rayssa-leal-skateboard-skate-fairy-tokyo-olympics"&gt;profile on the Olympics’ website&lt;/a&gt; says that she was just eight years old when that viral video started spreading across Vine in 2015, after a version that included failed attempts and falls was &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7VndX1A81b/"&gt;posted to her Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is5m3MxdGeI"&gt;been making a name for herself&lt;/a&gt; in her native country Brazil, and in US and global competitions, before eventually landing at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to go on being the lively little girl I am for all of Brazil.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZUcWK"&gt;You can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWz--lUTl5k"&gt;the performance that earned her the silver&lt;/a&gt; down below, which ends with Leal giving the event’s gold medal winner Momiji Nishiya a congratulatory hug. It’s worth a view not only to see &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/26/teenagers-olympics-street-skateboarding/"&gt;two thirteen-year-old girls&lt;/a&gt; show us what Olympic sportsmanship is like, but also for the absolutely incredible frontside feebles — for those impressed by Leal’s Vine appearance, her Olympic showing will be mind-blowing. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MI90PO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might not be the last time you see real people interacting with fictional (but real in my heart) pokémon. Netflix is reportedly in early development on a live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; TV series, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/pokemon-netflix-series-live-action-joe-henderson-1235026390/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Lucifer &lt;/em&gt;co-showrunner and executive producer Joe Henderson attached to shepherd the project to a screen near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8TgO7"&gt;It felt almost like a fluke that &lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu &lt;/em&gt;happened at all, given the relative obscurity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17078436/detective-pikachu-pokemon-preview-nintendo-3ds-creatures-interview"&gt;of the niche &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; spinoff game it was based on&lt;/a&gt; and Nintendo’s seeming reluctance to take big swings on live-action adaptations after the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/7/11876636/super-mario-bros-film-harrowing"&gt;mythically lackluster quality of the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. &lt;/em&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;As of late, though, Nintendo’s been expanding into other mediums — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;like theme parks&lt;/a&gt; — and taking on new partners — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530737/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-nintendo-leak-release-date"&gt;like Ubisoft and its &lt;em&gt;Rabbids&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt; — so maybe the time is right for a popular Netflix show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6He79"&gt;For Netflix, a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; show is just another step toward what it sees as its partially game-driven future. The company already has a hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and arguably another with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows in the works. It’s also just made it clear that it actually wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;to fund and deliver mobile games to its subscribers&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. A &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; show could continue a relationship with Nintendo it was already reported to be cultivating. As early as 2015, it was rumored that Nintendo and Netflix were developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/6/7993603/netflix-legend-of-zelda-live-action-series"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, which was reportedly &lt;a href="https://collider.com/what-happened-to-the-legend-of-zelda-netflix-series/"&gt;canceled due to leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Lqzb"&gt;That &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; show never came to fruition and given just how early this &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; project sounds, it’s very possible it ends up going the same way. But Nintendo and Netflix are in very different places than they were half a decade ago. Maybe this time live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; lightning strikes twice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos offers NASA $2 billion to pick Blue Origin’s lunar lander in last-minute plea</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBbMJv"&gt;Jeff Bezos is offering NASA a discount of at least $2 billion for the agency to give his space company a lucrative human lunar landing system contract that his rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, won earlier this year. Bezos’ new offer is the latest in an escalating string of efforts to win the contract for Blue Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHyTQ9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson"&gt;Monday morning letter&lt;/a&gt; to NASA administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said he’d &lt;strong&gt;permanently &lt;/strong&gt;waive up to $2 billion in contract payments for the first two years if NASA adds Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander to a key phase of the agency’s Human Landing System program, which calls for landing the first humans on the lunar surface in decades. On top of that, Blue Origin would self-fund a Blue Moon test launch to low-Earth orbit, a feat likely worth hundreds of millions more. “I believe this mission is important,” Bezos said. “I am honored to offer these contributions and am grateful to be in a financial position to be able to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UfVg3g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All NASA needs to do is take advantage of this offer...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqDYWG"&gt;NASA didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The plea comes a week before the watchdog&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Government Accountability Office is due to rule on a formal protest of NASA’s award to SpaceX that Blue Origin filed this spring. “All NASA needs to do is take advantage of this offer and amend” the contract, Bezos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qySHrz"&gt;It’s not quite that simple, says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Lori Garver, NASA’s former deputy administrator who oversaw the beginning of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Bezos’ offer is something the agency shouldn’t brush aside, Garver said, but it also might not work out the way Blue Origin wants it to. “I see this as a positive sign overall, but it should not impact the current awards or strategy,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4dkkl"&gt;This all started in April when NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;announced it went with SpaceX’s Starship system&lt;/a&gt; to ferry the first US crew of humans to the Moon in nearly a half-century by 2024, shelving proposals from Blue Origin and another bidder, Dynetics. Those companies are still in the running for a future Moon competition that’s still in the works, but NASA claimed its limited funds from Congress only allowed the agency to choose a single contractor: SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktsafe"&gt;Eventually bringing on more competing contractors, Garver says, “was always the plan, and it is good to know we will now have one putting their own skin in the game too.” That being said, she thinks it’s unlikely that the new offer will change NASA’s mind about the current award. &lt;strong&gt;Agency staff have worried that tweaking NASA’s decision to award SpaceX a lone contract could spawn new legal problems.&lt;/strong&gt; “NASA can’t just ‘take offers’ because funding is offered. There’s absolutely nothing to stop Blue from moving forward with their own money to get in a better position to win something in the next round,” Garver says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcAUFT"&gt;In his letter, Bezos said the $2 billion offer would “bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall” and “get the program back on track right now,” appealing to NASA’s speedy 2024 Moonshot deadline and the agency’s ever-present need for more Artemis funding. Blue Origin’s protest of NASA’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;halted SpaceX’s $3 billion NASA contract&lt;/a&gt; while the GAO adjudicates the facts of the case. The deadline for the GAO’s ruling is August 2nd, or next Monday. That ruling could recommend — but not force — NASA to restart the award program and revise its decision, or dismiss Blue Origin’s protest and resume NASA’s current plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Bezos’ proposed $2 billion discount on Blue Origin’s lunar lander for NASA comes just after he launched to the edge of space on its space tourism rocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mbgx85"&gt;Since filing its protest, Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22457893/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-senate-competition-bill-nasa-moon-lander"&gt;set off a strategy&lt;/a&gt; aimed at convincing NASA to issue a “corrective action” on its HLS decision before the GAO comes out with its ruling. Blue Origin’s CEO Bob Smith &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenateCommerce/status/1397250684173623306"&gt;barnstormed&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol in May, and the lengthy GAO protest process afforded Blue Origin lobbyists time to push for legislation that’d allow NASA to spend $10 billion more on its HLS program, a portion of which could hypothetically help fund the company’s lunar lander. But both prongs of their strategy might not follow through as planned. The amendment, which passed the Senate and is being debated in the House, was branded by critics as a “Bezos Bailout.” And GAO protests are rarely successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq7yTt"&gt;Bezos’ $2 billion discount offer is the company’s latest — and arguably its most desperate — effort to give NASA a reason to pick Blue Origin’s Blue Moon proposal. But it isn’t the first personal offer from Bezos. In 2019, on the heels of a flashy reveal of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander in Washington, DC, Bezos met with then-NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine at the agency’s headquarters to offer to pay 30 percent of the cost of Blue Origin’s lunar lander demonstration mission, or roughly $200 million at the time, according to three people familiar with the visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb366n"&gt;Since that reveal in DC, Blue Origin assembled a “National Team” of partners including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Under that partnership, Northrop will build Blue Moon’s transfer element, which helps detach the system from a module orbiting the Moon as it begins its trek to the surface. Blue Origin will manage the portion that puts the astronauts on the Moon. And Lockheed will lead crewed flight training and build Blue Moon’s Ascent Element, the portion of the lander that launches from the lunar surface to a space station orbiting the Moon called Gateway. The Monday letter from Bezos also promises to “shield NASA from partner cost escalation concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
