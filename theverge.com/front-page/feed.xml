    <title>White House says infrastructure deal includes $65 billion for broadband</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Participates In Campaign Event For Virginia Gubernatorial Candidate Terry McAuliffe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-aHvyOs3pl8XV_ocsn75SGspjc=/0x0:5088x3392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646655/1234138315.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OEeePl"&gt;On Wednesday, bipartisan Senate negotiators &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-historic-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; on an infrastructure package after weeks of tense discussion. The package includes billions in new funding, including more money to connect every household to high-speed broadband, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDaqM2"&gt;The Senate’s infrastructure package is expected to be around $1.2 trillion over the next eight years with around $559 billion in new spending. The White House sent out a press release Wednesday outlining what’s included in the bill, focusing on “hard” infrastructure issues like roads, bridges, EV charging, public transit, and high-speed broadband. Specifically, the package includes a $65 billion “investment ensuring every American has access to reliable high-speed internet,” according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ldbnvC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8QTXk"&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans to consumers along with easy ways to “comparison shop” amongst providers. Still, the bill text remains unwritten and it’s unclear how the new investment in broadband will be delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gELow"&gt;The $65 billion figure is significantly lower than what President Joe Biden originally proposed last March. The administration’s initial goal was to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;pass $100 billion in broadband spending&lt;/a&gt; and include language that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397778/biden-infrastructure-broadband-digital-divide-municipal-networks-republicans"&gt;prioritize networks&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with local governments, nonprofits, and cooperatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEKEK2"&gt;The White House also announced Wednesday that the package would include language from the Digital Equity Act that would create a permanent program to subsidize the cost of broadband for low-income families along with a new program to help pay for devices like laptops and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Enq8"&gt;As the Senate moves to start voting on this package tonight, the agency in charge of broadband expansion, the Federal Communications Commission, is still without a permanent leader. Earlier this year, former FCC Chair Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the agency deadlocked with two Republicans and two Democrats. Biden has yet to appoint a fifth commissioner or formally appoint a permanent chair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google remembers Voice exists, adds new missed call and caller ID features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73GmjMEHt8eQx-ovsoZSkiUmgHQ=/60x0:1707x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646522/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_11.14.27_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sdrNRB"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/enhancements-to-google-voice.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s adding new caller ID, missed call, and SMS message features to Google Voice on Wednesday. The otherwise minor update is notable because Google Voice has fallen to the wayside while Google focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;on other messaging boondoggles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD2xqC"&gt;From the missed calls or voicemail sections of the mobile Google Voice app, you can now learn why you might have missed a call (for example, Do Not Disturb was on), and receive directions on how to make sure that doesn’t happen again (turning Do Not Disturb off). Google is also making it easier to redial dropped calls and switch to your mobile network if your Wi-Fi connection was the reason your call failed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eVAqTYpNg6wfH3PMVityxc2_rWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746295/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Voice can tell you why you missed a call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sUqQCE"&gt;If you use Google Voice on iOS to forward calls to your personal number, now you can have the app display your Google Voice number on caller ID rather than the original linked number. SMS messages can now be deleted in bulk on the web version of Google Voice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3YYTT"&gt;Google’s various attempts to connect people outside of Gmail have long been somewhat confused — we’ve even made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;a timeline of the journey so far&lt;/a&gt; — but Voice, in particular, has felt forgotten in the wake of Google Fi offering a more traditional phone service. Voice received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17687862/google-voice-icon-dnd-ios-update"&gt;a redesign in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/08/dark-theme-now-available-for-google.html"&gt;a dark mode in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but as a business-oriented Workspace product, it hasn’t really received as many dramatic evolutions as Google’s wild stabs at text and video chats. For the committed Google Voice user not at risk of forgetting the service exists, that might be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the evidence a fired Blizzard developer’s ‘Cosby Suite’ existed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3G6kvN9mc6N1nNo-63vYWAJVtOI=/0x0:924x616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646496/cosby_suite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5qQmW"&gt;As employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;walk out of Activision Blizzard today&lt;/a&gt; over allegations of “constant sexual harassment” and workplace discrimination — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;how poorly they felt the company responded&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; has released &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; backing up allegations that a fired developer kept a hotel suite named after alleged rapist Bill Cosby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbSPHK"&gt;In case you’re catching up, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the state of California sued Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for gender discrimination last week. The allegations include claims specifically naming Alex Afrasiabi, the former senior creative director of &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft. &lt;/em&gt;The suit says that on top of sexually harassing women, Afrasiabi had a hotel room during BlizzCon 2013 nicknamed the “Cosby Suite” — and it suggested that other employees knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz219z"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;’s report nor the California lawsuit say anyone was sexually abused specifically in the Cosby Suite, but it’s increasingly clear the suite was a real thing. As you can see above, there’s a picture of alleged Blizzard developers literally holding up a framed photo of Bill Cosby. &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says the suite was “a hot spot for informal networking at BlizzCon ... where people looking to make inroads at the company would go to meet and hang out with some of its top designers.” One source told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that the original intent wasn’t sexual — saying it was a reference to Cosby’s “iconic ugly sweaters” — but Cosby already faced multiple sexual assault accusations at the time and other sources apparently understood it as a reference to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08Vuyg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says it has a Facebook album full of photos from the suite, comments of a sexual nature, screenshots of an alleged chat with several named Blizzard developers identifying themselves as the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew,” and sources attesting to the existence of a “boys club” there. One former Blizzard designer allegedly bragged in comments about “gathering the hot chixx for the Coz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBwlZG"&gt;It’s not clear how serious the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew’s” statements were intended to be, but Activision Blizzard confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that it terminated Afrasiabi after it was made aware of the complaint’s allegations last month. That’s something the company hadn’t previously revealed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Mo6SA"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;the full report at &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Robinhood really democratizing finance?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhXuuR9misRtxGy5wRzHBt7WozE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646072/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ksr0Ml"&gt;Robinhood is scheduled to price its stock today before trading begins tomorrow, and yesterday, it disclosed a new investigation: the finance industry’s self-regulator is checking to see whether founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt should be registered with them. Currently, the co-founders aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc6ncp"&gt;Is this a big deal? Maybe, I don’t know. I don’t work at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an organization you may remember from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;the historic fine&lt;/a&gt; it leveled against Robinhood — $70 million — for, among other things, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;the outages that took place in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. (About $12 million went to the people who were harmed, and the rest went to FINRA because that’s Wall Street, baby.) I am somewhat less concerned with FINRA’s investigation than I am with how this was disclosed: in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021014488/robinhoods-1a2.htm"&gt;an amended version of Robinhood’s prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeKMnm"&gt;The prospectus is the regulatory filing investors are encouraged to read before they decide to put money into an IPO. It is very long. If you want to find the exact disclosures, I suggest CTRL+f (or CMD+f) for “on July 26, 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIeZrN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzhwuf"&gt;As part of its go-public plan, Robinhood is offering an unprecedented amount of its IPO to retail investors &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the public trading starts tomorrow. Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ee755c02-dd09-4041-8b14-efad30a662a6"&gt;more than a third&lt;/a&gt; of its shares will go to users of its app, who — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;as Robinhood has also told us in its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; — are often first-time investors (more than half of its customers!). I watched the roadshow for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22592076/robinhood-ipo-roadshow-tenev-questions"&gt;those investors on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, and I did not get the impression that the presentation was for sophisticated investors. This is partly because Tenev wasted time on a question about his favorite planet but also because some of the questions Robinhood chose to answer in the presentation &lt;em&gt;were in the prospectus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GREfpH"&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus. That’s why putting the FINRA thing in there has my eyebrows at my hairline. I know there are restrictions on what a company can say before it goes public, but &lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/quiet-period"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission allows&lt;/a&gt; companies to communicate about “factual business information” during the quiet period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Rm8"&gt;“I’m curious about why this is coming out now,” says Robert Le, a senior analyst at Pitchbook. “Why is it coming out on the eve of the IPO?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOlm1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;CNN first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, and Bhatt, the company’s chief creative officer, weren’t registered with FINRA in February. FINRA has a rule about firms, called broker-dealers, that trade securities on behalf of their customers: their CEOs must be registered. But Tenev is the CEO of Robinhood Markets, the parent company, which is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a broker-dealer. What &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;registered with FINRA is a subsidiary. In the February report, Robinhood told CNN that Tenev “does not directly manage the FINRA-registered leaders of the broker-dealer or clearing broker” and “declined to say who does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tn3ysF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal — but some are more equal than others&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pzh0ky"&gt;Okay. It’s not clear to me that Tenev and Bhatt have &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; done anything wrong here. Our Bitcoin-addled boy, Jack Dorsey, isn’t listed among the registered, for instance — even though his company, Square, has an arm that allows investments, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. In its initial report on Tenev and Bhatt, the registration concern was “a gray area,” Charles Whitehead, law professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN. “If they are the CEO of a shell company that does nothing more than manage the broker-dealer, that’s an issue,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZS1C"&gt;So Square isn’t primarily in the business of investments; payments are the bread and butter, really. With Robinhood, on the other hand, it kind of seems like investments are the entire point. Also, Tenev has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/investing/robinhood-gamestop-vlad-tenev/index.html"&gt;made comments on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; (in an interview with Elon Musk!) about getting a call at 3AM because he needed to round up $3 billion to give to his clearinghouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYJFyL"&gt;I trust FINRA will sort this out. But however the investigation resolves, it doesn’t strengthen my confidence that Tenev and Bhatt’s big talk about democratizing finance is serious. In fact, it underlines something else in the S-1: the difference in voting rights between Class A stock (what IPO investors get) and Class B stock, which is what the founders get. Class B holders get 10x the voting rights of Class A owners. In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal, but — with apologies to George Orwell — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/0451526341?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some investors are more equal than others&lt;/a&gt;. Tenev and Bhatt didn’t discuss this in the roadshow, and I don’t think it was because the planet question was more important. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Tesla will open up its Superchargers to other EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWaKGbigAKCU4PtLZFX_uOLsiEY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645971/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X8I4hI"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, talked about opening up his company’s vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. But earlier this month, Musk tweeted that Tesla plans to do this “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;,” and this week, he finally offered some details about how it might work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWDAWZ"&gt;It will be “real simple,” Musk claimed on an investor call Monday. Owners of other EVs will be able to charge at a Supercharger station by using the Tesla app — which, right now, is geared toward people who’ve purchased the company’s products. That’s about all Tesla will have to do to make this possible in Europe and China, where there are standardized charging cable connectors, Musk said. (Tesla has already committed to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/24/tesla-confirms-plan-open-supercharger-network-other-automakers-next-year/"&gt;opening up the network in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS3tRq"&gt;But Tesla has a proprietary connector in North America, so non-Tesla vehicles here will need an adapter. That could be up to the other automakers to make; Musk has previously said that Tesla has held talks with other automakers about &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;sharing costs&lt;/a&gt; in order to open up the Supercharger network, and in 2018, he said competitors would have to be “able to accept our charge rate and our connector, at least have an adapter to our connector.” Tesla may still make its own, as Musk said he anticipates making them available at Supercharger stations as long as “people don’t sort of steal them or something.” (Tesla energy lead Drew Baglino assured his boss on the call that his team “has a good solution for that.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="eEyOMB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp;amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp;amp; high power charging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2fAnK"&gt;This adapter would likely have to be certified (something typically done by &lt;a href="https://www.ul.com/"&gt;third parties like UL&lt;/a&gt;) and some basic software written to handle the “handshake” that happens between a car and the charger before electrons start flowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZuqAJ"&gt;If Tesla allows other electric vehicles to charge on the Supercharger network, it could be a big boost for the nascent — but growing — EV market. The company has already built out almost 3,000 stations and nearly 27,000 connectors worldwide, which can charge at faster rates than most other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEFl3h"&gt;Plenty of already-open charging networks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;EVgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/491057/chargepoint-completed-business-combination-spac/"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/01/12/2157472/0/en/Blink-Charging-Announces-Closing-of-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock-for-Total-Gross-Proceeds-of-232-1-Million.html"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; have recently gone public and plan to use much of that fresh funding to expand their networks. But  unlocking the Supercharger network to owners of other EVs could more immediately help alleviate the twin headaches of finding available (and working) chargers and time spent charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otEdFe"&gt;It could be a financial boon for Tesla, too, as Baglino said on an investor call Monday. “Increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster. That’s a good thing there,” he said. Something that went unsaid: the possibility that opening up the network could make Tesla’s superchargers more appealing to government subsidy programs. (President Biden has said he wants to build &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;500,000 charging stations&lt;/a&gt; as part of a $15 billion investment in the technology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elp0F3"&gt;There is at least one big potential hangup for this plan, though: capacity — not the energy kind, but the how-crowded-will-Superchargers-get kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWygGu"&gt;As Tesla’s vehicles become more popular, Supercharger stations in some big cities have gotten crowded. In some respect, that’s good for Tesla — hanging out at Superchargers while you charge is a great way to meet other potentially like-minded Tesla owners, which, in turn, helps grow the company’s legion of devotees. But waiting in line only to then wait again while you charge is a drag, and things will only get more crowded if Tesla opens up the Supercharger network to other EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEv7LY"&gt;To solve this, Musk said Tesla may play with dynamic pricing. For instance, the company could jack up prices if your EV charges at a slower rate than a Tesla because, as Musk said Monday, the “biggest constraint at Superchargers is time.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="b7tV9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a lot of work for the Supercharger team”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq3IVa"&gt;The bigger blocker, Musk said, is that Tesla is making cars at a faster rate than it’s building new Supercharger stations. Opening the network is “only useful to the public if we’re able to [build Superchargers] faster than Tesla vehicle output,” he said. “So this is a lot of work for the Supercharger team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrf1Uw"&gt;Access to a large, exclusive network of fast charging stations has long been one of the selling points of buying a Tesla, which could make this transition a tricky one, according to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at &lt;a href="http://iSeeCars.com"&gt;iSeeCars.com&lt;/a&gt;. “Elon will have to balance his desire to widen EV charging access — and increase Tesla’s revenue — with keeping his owner body happy,” Brauer said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That may be a bridge too far, even for Elon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvHrMR"&gt;But opening up the network could also be a powerful marketing tool for a company that famously doesn’t spend money on traditional advertising, &lt;em&gt;Autotrader &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Brian Moody said via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EJA2qM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I bet it leads to more Tesla buyers long term.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5T9bqs"&gt;“The smart thing about this idea is that it gradually exposes motorists, especially those who are already interested in EVs, to the Tesla brand. I bet it leads to more Tesla buyers long term,” Moody wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggRXvw"&gt;As much as an exclusive Supercharger network has been a selling point for Tesla, Musk maintained on Monday that he always hoped to open it up to other electric vehicles — and took a shot at another Silicon Valley giant in the process. “Our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some company,” he said, before fake coughing and adding: “&lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrpYnq"&gt;It’s something that those other charging networks have also anticipated. In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001821159/000110465921094028/tm2122501d1_s1.htm"&gt;financial filing&lt;/a&gt;, EVgo admitted that Tesla opening up its Supercharger network “could further reduce demand for charging at our sites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jk2LE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wma6ta"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> United Airlines will let passengers preorder food and snacks online before flights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8e5aSyqgng_2C5R6H8pn3lVV9M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645922/Inflight_Pre_Order_Hero.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANUdow"&gt;United Airlines announced a new option for passengers to preorder food, snacks, and beverages online up to five days before their scheduled flight. Orders can be made either on United’s website or through the airline’s mobile app. United claims that it is the “first and only” carrier to allow economy customers this option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv7Uee"&gt;Previously, only premium customers on certain eligible flights could preorder their food and drinks. Now, United is extending the option to all ticket-holders. To start out, only passengers on flights from Chicago to Honolulu; Orange County, CA; Sacramento, CA; and San Diego will be eligible to preorder food and drinks. But by early fall, United says it will extend the option to passengers of all flights over 1,500 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBfjVk6Wr9dtLJeKM9o61m5u7Kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745769/Preorder_Multiscreen_Hero_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYOM41"&gt;United has been adding amenities and eliminating nuisance fees as a strategy to help attract customers back inside its planes. Last year, the airline permanently eliminated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;change fee policy&lt;/a&gt;, quickly followed by its main rivals, Delta and American. United also recently added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;Bluetooth option&lt;/a&gt; for in-flight entertainment. With customer demand still below pre-pandemic levels, the airline industry as a whole is seeking to make flying look safe, stress-free, and, most of all, cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAK361"&gt;United is billing the food and drink preorder option as a way to improve service, allowing flight attendants to move through the cabins faster and delivering more personalized service to passengers. Preorders are handled through United’s contactless payment system, which the airline also claims is safer for passengers and flight attendants (although &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4"&gt;evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; that COVID is rarely transmitted through surface contact). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM2TSU"&gt;Customers who choose not to preorder their food and drinks can still do so during the flight. But United is urging customers to load their credit card in the app’s digital wallet in order to facilitate contactless payment while on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KgP8r"&gt;Earlier this year, United announced new food and drink menus for flights over two hours, including alcoholic seltzer brand White Claw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1TAVr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6nFC2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After years of turmoil, Boeing’s Starliner capsule is set for a do-over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA Launches Test Flight Of Boeing Starliner Spacecraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MhBVQWW2v4-qqKn1TTioAsKvlvM=/166x0:5058x3261/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645834/1189661494.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Test-launching its astronaut capsule a second time, Boeing needs a success now more than ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gDspJf"&gt;Boeing, once a major player in space, has suffered a string of setbacks, failures, and legal challenges in recent years that have chipped away its dominance in the space industry. The company’s space unit has been lapped by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and left to watch on the sidelines as other companies have moved ahead with ambitious programs, from sending astronauts to the International Space Station to returning humans to the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oynrNe"&gt;On Friday, Boeing will try to mend its reputation during an uncrewed test of its Starliner astronaut capsule to the ISS. This will be the second launch for the capsule, coming a year and a half after its first attempt failed to reach the space station. Eighteen months of grueling technical investigations and a string of leadership shake-ups has brought Boeing back to the launch pad for a $410 million do-over that would put it on track for its first launch with humans aboard later this year. SpaceX, Boeing’s rival in NASA’s Commercial Crew program, is far ahead, with three astronaut missions already under its belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixid9T"&gt;The company has seen its once-close relationship with the space agency dwindle since the beginning of its Starliner program. Focusing more on SpaceX, NASA officials overlooked Boeing’s software problems that led to Starliner’s failure. Two investigations, one related to potential fraud in its Starliner program and a criminal probe into Boeing’s bid on a lunar lander contract, pushed the company’s reputation in deeper trouble, locking Boeing out of the first major contracts in NASA’s Artemis program. For Boeing, another Starliner failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vC6RD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s of paramount importance that we have a successful flight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hss9cy"&gt;“It’s of paramount importance that we have a successful flight,” John Vollmer, Boeing’s Starliner chief, said last week. “This is a serious and unforgiving business, so we take it very seriously... All that we’ve done in the past 18 months, we are very confident that we are going to have a good flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUH4M3"&gt;The CST-100 Starliner capsule, a gumdrop-shaped astronaut pod designed to carry cargo and up to seven passengers, will launch without humans on Friday at 2:53PM ET. It’ll carry out the motions of a routine mission: launch to space, dock to the ISS for ten days, then come home — blazing through Earth’s atmosphere at first, then floating under parachutes the rest of the way down to a desert in New Mexico. The mission, called Orbital Flight Test-2, is one of the last tests Boeing needs to nail before its final test, flying a crew of NASA astronauts. Once Starliner wins its NASA certification like SpaceX’s Crew Dragon did last year, up to six operational missions to the ISS for the agency follow. Both companies developed their capsules under the NASA program, with Boeing’s Starliner contract at $4.5 billion and SpaceX’s at $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fM5a2i"&gt;Starliner’s 2019 failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm7mQd"&gt;Boeing was banking on success ahead of Starliner’s first orbital test in December 2019. At the time, the company was entrenched in its 737 Max crisis. A clean launch would “restore the Boeing brand,” then-Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told senior NASA officials at Kennedy Space Center hours before liftoff, according to people familiar with the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DC1oZo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Starliner success would “restore the Boeing brand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2yCJ6"&gt;But Starliner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;, and Boeing’s board ousted Muilenburg days later. The capsule didn’t reach the ISS and instead returned to New Mexico just two days after launch. Thirty minutes after liftoff, when Starliner was supposed to enter orbit, a series of software failures led the capsule to think it was in a vastly different phase of its mission, causing its suite of onboard thrusters to fire haphazardly, expending crucial amounts of fuel. An unexpected communications blackout prevented mission control from fixing the spacecraft remotely. Once Boeing got Starliner in a shallow orbit, it decided to send the capsule home early. Hours before Starliner was due to reenter, engineers scrambled to patch another software glitch that would have caused the capsule’s service module — the bottom portion that ejects before reentry — to crash into the capsule itself. Once “catastrophic spacecraft failure” was averted — as NASA safety adviser Paul Hill would describe it months later — Starliner landed safely in the New Mexico desert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule landed safely back on Earth after a hectic two-day mission in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aZHsH9"&gt;NASA and Boeing convened an independent team of veteran engineers to investigate the causes of Starliner’s failures, eventually recommending 80 different fixes — 61 to Boeing’s software and 19 to the capsule’s communications system. Boeing and NASA agreed to a test redo since Starliner never demonstrated its ability to dock to the station. “That’s the part of the flight that, to me, is so critical,” NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich told reporters on Tuesday. The redo and “several performance items” for Starliner cost Boeing at least $410 million, Greg Smith, the company’s then-chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWJuzM"&gt;Boeing has since overhauled the way it tests and validates its software, both on Starliner and across some of its other NASA programs, like its Space Launch System rocket. Starliner’s communications system was upgraded and Boeing hired a new software VP from SpaceX, Jinnah Hosein. Months before Friday’s mission, the company had simulated a full test mission for the first time, from launch to ISS docking to landing — something it didn’t do prior to Starliner’s first mission. That’s on top of “hundreds of hundreds” of other simulations totaling “literally thousands of hours,” Vollmer told reporters on Tuesday. All 80 corrections recommended by the independent Boeing-NASA team have been made, which involved a “relatively small set” of flight software changes, Vollmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Triua"&gt;Though Starliner is back at its launch site, Boeing’s relationship with NASA has taken lasting hits. NASA has shifted toward leaner, cheaper contracting models intended to make the agency a customer — not an owner — of spacecraft developed by companies mainly with their own funds. Boeing, a publicly traded aerospace giant, is accustomed to the opposite: building hardware that NASA will exclusively own under larger development contracts that come with incentives for the contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule sits atop an Atlas-V rocket in ULA’s launch integration tower in Florida ahead of its launch this Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ux9zw4"&gt;Boeing’s waning relationship with NASA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lWvU1h"&gt;With the private, fixed-price model of its Starliner contract, Boeing bears more responsibility and risk than it is used to. Its work on such programs has been cited in financial filings as “inherently risky” that “subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues.” With SpaceX’s Crew Dragon far ahead in operations, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin fiercely competing for more lunar lander funds, Boeing is struggling to adapt to mounting competition from the billionaire-backed space companies. NASA, too, has struggled under this commercial shift. The agency, under political pressure to end its reliance on Russia’s space program for rides to the space station, has also faced pressure from Boeing to bend the rules of its fixed-price Starliner contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FwndUN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$661 million in Boeing deals probed for fraud&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ARWRfg"&gt;In 2019, $661 million worth of Boeing deals with NASA were investigated for fraud by the agency’s inspector general 2019, according to documents obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request. That investigation, previously unreported, focused on two deals that, taken together, raised concerns among auditors of procurement fraud as Boeing was on the verge of canceling its Starliner contract. One involved a $287 million boost to Boeing’s Starliner contract in late 2016, and another involving Boeing’s sale of $374 million worth of Russian Soyuz seats to NASA two months later in 2017. The investigation sheds some light on an early instance where Boeing’s relationship with NASA began to strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5LlRO"&gt;For the Starliner deal in late 2016, Boeing asked NASA to raise the value of its fixed-price Starliner contract after running into months of development delays that Boeing itself caused. As fixed-price contracts typically require the contractor to bear the cost of falling behind, not the agency, several NASA attorneys initially objected to Boeing’s proposal over fears it would violate the contract, according to a partially redacted document NASA refused to release until &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;filed a FOIA appeal. But Boeing, according to four people with first-hand knowledge of the private discussions, threatened to drop out of the Commercial Crew Program if NASA didn’t agree to the contract boost (Boeing denied this in 2019, issuing a &lt;a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-18-Boeing-Statement-Regarding-OIG-Report-on-NASAs-Commercial-Crew-Program"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that said “any implication that we ever wavered in our participation in Commercial Crew is false). NASA ultimately agreed to the $287 million boost, justifying its payment by citing fears that recent rocket failures with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12748752/spacex-launch-site-explosion-cape-canaveral-florida"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13806300/russia-roscosmos-spacecraft-international-space-station-mission"&gt;Russia’s Soyuz rocket&lt;/a&gt; would jeopardize the agency’s ability to send astronauts to the ISS in the next two years. In exchange, Boeing agreed to speed up the time it’d take to build Starliner capsules for crewed missions it said would occur as early as 2019. Boeing has yet to fly humans under the program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next to two cosmonauts, NASA astronaut Andrew Feustel launches to the ISS in March 2018 in a Russian Soyuz seat that NASA paid Boeing $81 million for, records show, as part of a rare $374 million deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrZPrY"&gt;Around the same time, Boeing entered settlement talks in an unrelated lawsuit with Russian rocket firm Energia, where it would obtain the rights to five astronaut seats on Russia’s Soyuz launch vehicle. Boeing offered to sell those seats to NASA for $374 million five days after the agency agreed to the $287 million Starliner boost. NASA ended up buying the seats from Boeing to solve the same schedule issue Boeing’s Starliner commitment was supposed to solve. Highly unusual, it marked the first time NASA bought Russian astronaut seats from a non-Russian entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rmwrk9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Less-than-optimal contract administration”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evzWql"&gt;Two years later, auditors with NASA’s inspector general examined the Starliner and Soyuz deals and referred their findings to the inspector general’s investigative unit for a fraud probe, according to a case memo. Investigators within that unit closed the case, finding that auditors’ concerns about the deals were “valid” but “less-than-optimal contract administration did not equate to fraud.” Boeing and NASA have defended the deals. When it was first reported in a &lt;a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-20-005.pdf"&gt;public audit&lt;/a&gt;, Boeing said it was taking on “significantly more upfront financial risk and is already helping NASA with critical decisions” on the space station, and that without getting the extra $287 million, the original contract structure would have “increased cost and schedule uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7glqdE"&gt;Boeing ran into more problems in 2020 when it sought to compete for a contract in NASA’s multimillion-dollar lunar lander program. The company was removed from the competition and became &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-boeing-exclusive/exclusive-boeing-to-face-independent-ethics-probe-over-lunar-lander-bid-document-idUSKBN2603F2"&gt;the target of a Justice Department investigation&lt;/a&gt; when its senior vice president for space and launch, Jim Chilton, discussed Boeing’s bid with NASA’s then-human exploration chief Doug Loverro. The conversation occurred while the agency was reviewing company proposals — a strict “blackout” period where agency contact with bidders is highly restricted. Loverro resigned, and Boeing &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-boeing-exclusive/exclusive-boeing-to-face-independent-ethics-probe-over-lunar-lander-bid-document-idUSKBN2603F2"&gt;reached an agreement with NASA&lt;/a&gt; that forced the company to carry out a private review of its ethics culture. Boeing fired an in-house attorney and a few employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jim Chilton, Boeing’s senior vice president of space and launch (left), speaks to reporters in December 2019 about problems with Starliner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hCVUDH"&gt;The investigations into Boeing’s Starliner deal and its role in NASA’s lunar lander competition stained the company’s space program. While space might not be a strong source of revenue for Boeing, participating in off-world missions is a source of company pride that boosts its brand and paves a path to future space ventures, including space tourism. “Allowing private citizens to experience the wonder of spaceflight is part of our future plans for Starliner,” a Boeing spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZloSaP"&gt;A successful Starliner mission would be a heavily needed win for Boeing after years of technical and management struggles. The company, though, still has a lot to learn about the spacecraft, and Friday’s flight is vital for its plans. “There are systems on this vehicle that we need to fully understand how they operate in the environment of space,” Vollmer said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="moEWgm"&gt;“Will there be some learning? There absolutely will be some learning. It’s a test flight.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Valve’s Gabe Newell explain why the Steam Deck exists</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJewW7lWAlkAHzIWezvHsPFDeNA=/535x0:2416x1254/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645831/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_10.16.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQzIhN"&gt;Valve president Gabe Newell has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kO6Dj2XNfY"&gt;given a rare interview&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, where he talks about why the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;upcoming Steam Deck handheld&lt;/a&gt; exists and the philosophy the company had when designing it. The interview is worth a watch to see Newell and developer Pierre-Loup Griffais discuss the motivation behind creating an “open” device (with Newell mentioning that you could hook up an Oculus Quest to it if you wanted), along with what discussions inside Valve led to the system’s development. &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-openness-superpower-closed-platforms-gabe-newell"&gt;has a write-up summarizing the interview&lt;/a&gt; if you’d rather read than watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOXzzh"&gt;Newell also discusses the obvious comparison between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch, saying Valve has chosen different trade-offs when creating its portable gaming system. The interview covers more topics, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/22/22244057/valve-gabe-newell-half-life-new-zealand-game-development"&gt;the future of work at Valve&lt;/a&gt;, Newell’s interest in medical research, and how the company is trying to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;the stock problems that have plagued consoles&lt;/a&gt; like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch. Of course, it wouldn’t be an interview with Gabe Newell if he wasn’t asked a question about &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;, which he answers by saying that “[&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s ending] feels like the right progression for where we’re going with &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ugCx7i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Half-Life: Alyx’s ending] feels like the right progression for where we’re going with Half-Life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="srBSOh"&gt;For those interested in Valve and the Steam Deck, this interview is well worth a watch. To paraphrase Newell talking about the Steam Deck: you’ll know if it's for you pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get rid of that irritating Meet tab in Gmail for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kElamayrognHUrlrAaydiKbTUWU=/26x0:1190x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67190053/google_meet_poup.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaSkVR"&gt;I have nothing against Google’s Meet videoconferencing platform — in fact, I’ve used it a few times — but I can’t help being annoyed when the feature is pushed at me via other apps. Specifically, Gmail. Meet first appeared on the desktop Gmail app in the spring of 2020, but it did not take up much space and was reasonably easy to ignore (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598038/how-to-google-meet-gmail-hide"&gt;remove from your screen&lt;/a&gt;, if you so wished).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOJcZ"&gt;A few months later, however, Meet made its way onto the mobile Gmail app via two tabs at the bottom of the screen: one labeled “Mail” and one labeled “Meet.” The problem here isn’t only that you’re being pushed to use a particular videoconferencing app while all you want to do is check your email, but it also takes up space, expanding the bottom margin of the app and giving you approximately three fewer lines to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail with the new bottom-screen tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XYtUnsnTj5HuA8a2U5Lfz46PaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728441/Screenshot_20200811_163146.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail with the new bottom-screen tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail without the new bottom-screen tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1em3NLHjIltFZrClTIAuhYPqQXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728442/Screenshot_20200811_163734.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail without the new bottom-screen tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14k2AS"&gt;If you plan to use Meet regularly, you may not mind. But if you don’t and you want to get rid of the excess tabs, here’s how you do it. These instructions apply to the Gmail app on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZUu4az"&gt;Select the three-line “hamburger” icon in the upper left corner, scroll down, and tap on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TGx5lA"&gt;Select the Gmail account you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jPcxtE"&gt;Scroll down to the “Meet” category and uncheck “Show the Meet tab for video calling.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to your Gmail settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EslLROXK2WTkcqTv6H3urORTsrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728454/Screenshot_20200811_163945.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to your Gmail settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck “Show the Meet tab for video calling.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4tjKkcSQ0MlsC2ipWb2mA6HctD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746129/Screenshot_20210728_131751__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck “Show the Meet tab for video calling.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl14YY"&gt;And that’s it! You’ve reclaimed some space on your Gmail app and can now use Zoom or whatever videoconferencing app you prefer without having to be constantly reminded of Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1HtNJl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free apps for video calling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uRtg5n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 2021, 1:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 11th, 2020. The introductory text has been tweaked, and a screenshot has been replaced to reflect a change in Gmail’s interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s new prepaid offer is a direct play for the Boost customers it sold to Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrffFC9Q_1SR134a9mRQi1GNxBw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645783/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile is offering customers who switch from an MVNO a discount on an unlimited Metro plan with 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPbUJx"&gt;T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fswitch-to-metro-by-t-mobile-get-a-free-5g-phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22598163%2Ft-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;introducing a new prepaid promotion&lt;/a&gt; with incentives for customers on other prepaid MVNOs to switch to Metro by T-Mobile, including waiving switching fees, a discount on an unlimited plan with 5G, and a trade-in offer for a new 5G phone. In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;it’s doing exactly what it told regulators it wouldn’t do&lt;/a&gt; when it acquired Sprint a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883y0L"&gt;The US wireless market is lousy with 5G phone trade-in offers and 5G plan upgrades these days, but this one stands out in its direct pitch to lure Boost Mobile customers to T-Mobile’s prepaid brand — the same customers it was ordered to sell to Dish network with the intention of setting the company up as a fourth wireless carrier to replace Sprint. It’s also what Dish warned might be coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;in a plea to the Federal Communications Commission earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJZy7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many Boost customers need a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vdm8eb"&gt;The promotion also appears to specifically appeal to Boost customers on Sprint’s old CDMA network — a network T-Mobile owns and operates and announced it would be shutting down on an unusually aggressive timeline. This leaves many Boost customers in need of a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate if they switch to Metro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlQkHS"&gt;“Get half off your unlimited line when you switch from Boost or Cricket by bringing your phone number to Metro by T-Mobile and trading in ANY working device for a limited time. Yes, any — even that old flip phone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC1pwS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJpm4H"&gt;The deal provides customers who switch and trade in a phone with a two-year discounted $25-per-month price on an unlimited plan with 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZjE2R"&gt;T-Mobile’s track record of keeping its Sprint merger promises is shaky at best. It has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;failed to create jobs it said it would&lt;/a&gt;, and while it has technically fulfilled its requirements to Dish Network, like selling Boost and providing wholesale network service, it hasn’t exactly been helpful either. This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers — the very customers Dish will need to retain if it’s going to becoming a full-fledged carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
