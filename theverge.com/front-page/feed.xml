    <title>Firefox’s latest security feature is designed to protect itself from buggy code</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oSzZdP"&gt;Firefox 95, the latest version of Mozilla’s browser that’s rolling out starting today, introduces a new security feature that’s designed to limit the damage that bugs and security vulnerabilities in its code can cause, &lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/"&gt;Mozilla announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called &lt;a href="https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/"&gt;RLBox&lt;/a&gt;, was developed with help from researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, and it was originally released &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-for-mac-and-linux-to-get-a-new-security-sandbox-system/"&gt;as a prototype last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s coming to both the desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYa4Yt"&gt;At its core, RLBox is a sandboxing technology, which means that it’s effectively able to isolate code so that any security vulnerabilities it might contain can’t harm the overall system. Sandboxing is a widely used security method across the industry, and browsers already run web content in sandboxed processes to try to stop malicious or buggy sites from compromising the overall browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXouSa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mozilla hopes other programs and browsers adopt the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWksHB"&gt;RLBox differs from this traditional approach, however, and doesn’t have the same costs to performance and memory usage. This makes it possible to sandbox critical browser subcomponents like its spell checker, effectively allowing it to treat them as untrusted code while still running in the same process. This places limits on how code can run or which memory it can access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jB0PO3"&gt;As of today’s release, Firefox is isolating five modules: its Graphite font rendering engine, Hunspell spell checker, Ogg multimedia container format, Expat XML parser, and Woff2 web font compression format. Mozilla says this means if bugs or vulnerabilities are discovered in one of these subcomponents, the Firefox team won’t need to scramble to stop them from compromising the entire browser. “Even a zero-day vulnerability in any of them should pose no threat to Firefox,” Mozilla says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYrnQy"&gt;Mozilla admits that it’s not a catch-all solution and that the approach won’t work everywhere, such as particularly performance-sensitive browser components. But the developer says it hopes to see other browsers and software projects implement the technology and that it intends to use it with more of Firefox’s components in the future. Mozilla has also updated its bug bounty program and will now pay researchers if they’re able to bypass the new sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reveals millions of videos get hit with incorrect copyright claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI4S5QatWSGpqfsLHMtN_DeS5CA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235302/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N4UQ5z"&gt;Over 2.2 million YouTube videos were hit with copyright claims that were later overturned between January and June of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the company today. The Copyright Transparency Report is the first of its kind published by YouTube, which says it will update biannually going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoWMD5"&gt;The 2.2 million incorrect claims represent less than 1 percent of the more than 729 million total copyright claims issued in the first half of this year, 99 percent of which originated from Content ID, YouTube’s automated enforcement tool. When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBHU5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5AssGC"&gt;Though mistaken copyright claims are a drop in the bucket on a larger scale, YouTube creators have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;long complained&lt;/a&gt; about how the platform handles claims, saying overly aggressive or unjustified enforcement can lead to lost income. Copyright claims can result in videos being blocked, audio being muted, or ad revenue going back to the rights owner. This new report gives shape to a problem that YouTube itself has acknowledged needs updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy1eAt"&gt;In 2019, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post that the company heard the concerns from creators and that YouTube was “exploring improvements in striking the right balance between copyright owners and creators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6hp6"&gt;The new report notes that “no system is perfect” and that errors happen even with established guardrails in place to prevent abuse of enforcement mechanisms. “When disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse, and over 60% of these disputes were resolved in favor of the uploader,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber will now let drivers and riders record audio during trips for safety</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6KxwQH5YdEU-oKqEWHRLm6hNjp0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235227/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCrpXZ"&gt;Uber is releasing its audio-recording feature to three US cities later this month, Uber said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Falways-looking-out%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22814616%2Fuber-new-safety-features-ridecheck-audio-recording" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKEnwK"&gt;At the beginning of a trip, riders and drivers can enable this feature by clicking the shield icon in the app’s Safety Toolkit and selecting “Record Audio.” While both riders and drivers can record individual trips, drivers have the option to leave the feature on while they’re actively seeking rides. The app will notify the rider if the driver is using the feature. Uber first launched audio recording in Latin America in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQz3kf"&gt;The move is the first in-app feature that provides audio documentation of rides. Uber &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/driving-and-delivering/article/can-i-use-a-video-camera-?nodeId=efaad152-cbb6-45fe-9d7d-911842d21c8b"&gt;allows drivers&lt;/a&gt; to use their own dashcams to record rides on their own if local laws permit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7OXeF"&gt;As for audio file privacy, the file is encrypted and stored on rider and driver’s devices, but no one can listen to the audio, even Uber. If either the rider or driver decides to submit a safety report, they can attach the audio file, and a trained Uber safety agent will decrypt and review the recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19OZQs"&gt;Along with audio recording, Uber is releasing audible seat belt alerts soon, according to the press release. The seat belt alert will come from the driver’s phone, and the rider will receive a push notification reminding them to put on their seat belt. Uber said that this feature will be available in the US in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAM2Ar"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — or NHTSA — &lt;a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813072"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 2020, the national seat belt use rate was 90.3 percent. NHTSA also &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/seat-belts"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts. NHTSA said they found no significant changes in seat belt use from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRyaWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSvLDT"&gt;Uber also announced enhancements for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868466/uber-ridecheck-detect-vehicle-crashes-smartphone-driver-gps"&gt;its RideCheck feature&lt;/a&gt;, first launched in 2019 to detect accidents and unusual long stops. Now, RideCheck can now detect when Uber drivers take an unexpected route or when a trip ends abruptly before the final destination. If detected, riders and drivers will receive a notification to make sure everything is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvqZMF"&gt;Uber first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;published a safety report&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 looking at data between 2017 and 2018 following increased complaints from occupants regarding its safety practices. Ultimately, these observations included the safety of drivers who have also complained to the company about rider behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G81n1M"&gt;Uber has been steadily releasing new safety features in response to both riders and drivers experiencing unsafe conditions during their trips, including allegations of sexual assault. In March, Uber, along with its competitor Lyft, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;announced that it would share&lt;/a&gt; information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05XEA5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This AI art app is a glimpse at the future of synthetic media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrUQnMvQG3cr_3Rk2WnA3dHgzbc=/167x0:3047x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235161/dream_wombo_ai_art_examples.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few example images generated by the Dream app. You can see the prompts used at the bottom of the picture. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnubep"&gt;If you’ve been hanging out on Twitter lately, then you’ve probably noticed a profusion of AI-generated images sprouting all over your timeline like weird, algorithmic visions. These pictures have been generated using a &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;new app called Dream&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone create “AI-powered paintings” by simply typing a brief description of what they want to see. It’s odd, often uncanny stuff — and extremely fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTlMjq"&gt;The resulting artwork has its own particular aesthetic, defined by swirling shapes and incoherent objects. The real magic, though, is that no matter what you type, the app will generate something that is visually compelling (at least until we get too used to these toys) and that matches your prompt in often surprisingly apposite ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYB12h"&gt;Consider, for example, the image below: “Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars.” Not only has the app created a picture that captures the mind-boggling galactic scale of a nebula, but the star-like highlights dotted around the space are mostly blue — a tint that is &lt;a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20219/relationship-between-metallicity-and-color-should-pop-i-stars-be-blue"&gt;scientifically accurate&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;metal-poor&lt;/em&gt; stars (as metallicity affects their color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2xkb9"&gt;A few &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wombo.art%2F&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wombo%20dream&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=top"&gt;searches&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter reveal plenty more examples, but really, you should have a play with the app yourself to understand it better. (If nothing else, the images it generates are exactly the right size to create a personalized wallpaper for your phone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E6Wscw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars” &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL"&gt;https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CXmFEDwc8F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CXmFEDwc8F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Kaitlin Rasmussen (@toomanyspectra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toomanyspectra/status/1467315733503754240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YT292B"&gt;This sort of AI-generated artwork is not new, but it is becoming higher quality and more accessible. Past examples of these sorts of text-to-image models have included research-orientated programs like &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/"&gt;DALL-E &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://alexasteinbruck.medium.com/vqgan-clip-how-does-it-work-210a5dca5e52"&gt;VQGAN+CLIP&lt;/a&gt;, as well as more specialized commercial projects like &lt;a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/landing_page/"&gt;Artbreeder&lt;/a&gt; (which is particularly good at creating portraits of fictional beings and people). With tools such as these, the AI art scene has exploded in recent years, with practitioners creating everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395115/roman-emperors-photorealistic-portraits-ai-artbreeder-dan-voshart"&gt;lifelike Roman emperors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/"&gt;infinite waifus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nzC649"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI-generated art is quickly improving in both quality and accessibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFuYaC"&gt;The Dream app takes things a step further with its speed, quality, and accessibility. It’s available on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wombo-dream/id1586366816"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.womboai.wombodream&amp;amp;utm_source=web-app&amp;amp;utm_campaign=web-app&amp;amp;pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;and the web&lt;/a&gt; and is the work of a Canadian startup named Wombo. The company previously made that AI-powered app that lets you feed in static images to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323271/wombo-ai-memes-deepfake-app-lip-sync"&gt;create lip-synced renditions&lt;/a&gt; of memeable songs. What exactly powers Dream isn’t clear (we’ve contacted Wombo to find out), but a lot of AI art tech is open-source, which means the firm has likely built on past work to create the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkhMyf"&gt;Generally, programs like these are trained on vision datasets — huge libraries of images that are tagged based on objects and scenery. The programs pick out consistent patterns and themes in these images and then use this information to try and generate something that matches the users’ prompt. We don’t know what dataset Dream’s algorithms were trained on, but based on its output, it’s safe to say it includes a wide range of imagery — able to generate pictures that correspond to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CanalBrushRush/status/1466518885931397121"&gt;anime characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reecee_yt/status/1465057776560967681"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dINF8M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found an app that is an ai attempting to make art and honestly??? This shit be popping off. I could never render these colors so vibrantly. &lt;br&gt;These were all created with the words “Knight armor” in Wombo Dream. Like??? They are gorgeous??? &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEANARv8Qm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mEANARv8Qm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MotherLyra (@Lyraa121) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lyraa121/status/1462336815613067271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1ru1U"&gt;The accessibility of Dream means it’s being put to novel uses, too. It’s been used for viral games (like inputting your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KaySocLearn/status/1467527596250333187"&gt;PhD thesis title&lt;/a&gt; and sharing the result) and for more directed projects as well. In one amazing Twitter thread, the writer and illustrator Ursula Vernon (who publishes under the name T. Kingfisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337"&gt;shared a short comic&lt;/a&gt; they’d made using Dream. The comic’s characters are drawn by hand, but the backgrounds are AI-generated, with the surreal, shifting quality of the images explained as a result of the setting: a dream library overseen by the Egyptian god of writing, Thoth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftw6Lh"&gt;Vernon tweeted about her experience, noting that she had to do a not-insignificant amount of work to prepare the images and that the inability of the program to create scenery from within a space with consistent architecture created its own challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1usH3s"&gt;“In Conclusion—does it work visually? I think the answer is ‘sort of,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467657377809940482"&gt;tweeted Vernon&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m very aware of the weirdnesses as an artist, obviously. As a dream sequence, the messed up architecture kinda works, but how long can you get away with it? Sooner or later, the reader is probably gonna notice that nothing takes place in the same scene from a different angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lWFY5d"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So this weekend, armed with a couple of AI art programs, I started noodling around to see what I could do, and if I could put together one of my Weird Little Comic ideas using mostly retouched computer generated imagery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These nine pages were the result. &lt;a href="https://t.co/POXoBN0Hbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/POXoBN0Hbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kingfisher &amp;amp; Wombat (@UrsulaV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w0aIKA"&gt;Despite its obvious limitations, Dream shows us a glimpse of the future of synthetic or AI-generated media. For evangelists in this space, the promise of the technology is one of infinite variety. In the future, they say, games, comics, films, and books will all be generated on the fly in response to our every prompt and whim. And although we’re a long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; way from such media matching the quality of human output, limited, hybrid applications will be coming sooner than you think — appearing like something first glimpsed in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QT5kt2"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating yet another merger between an EV startup and a special purpose acquisition company, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. This time, it’s the massive deal from July that turned Saudi-owned Lucid Motors into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;a publicly traded company worth more than $20 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUBWSP"&gt;Lucid Motors announced the probe in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465921146500/tm2134520d5_424b3.htm"&gt;a Monday morning stock exchange filing&lt;/a&gt;. The startup said that it received a subpoena from the SEC on December 3rd “requesting the production of certain documents related to an investigation” that “appears to concern” the merger, as well as “certain projections and statements.” Lucid Motors said it’s “cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dvLUw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BduTOx"&gt;The startup, which was founded in 2007 as a battery tech company and rescued by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt; that it was merging with a SPAC run by investor Michael Klein called Churchill Capital IV. Lucid Motors ultimately raised more than $4 billion in the deal and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;shipping its first electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — the Air sedan — in October. The startup’s valuation had soared since, and it recently passed the market cap of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;legacy automakers like Ford&lt;/a&gt;. But Monday’s news sent Lucid Motors’ stock tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL5jLv"&gt;The SEC is already investigating the SPAC mergers that turned Lordstown Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and Nikola into publicly traded electric vehicle startups. The agency has been particularly focused on the validity of the financial projections these companies made when they announced the mergers, as well as any claims they made about the preorders collected for their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Qo6h"&gt;Nikola’s founder was indicted earlier this year on charges brought by the SEC (as well as parallel charges from the Department of Justice), and the company recently said it has set aside $125 million for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/nikola-expects-125-million-sec-penalty-under-proposed-resolution.html"&gt;an expected settlement with the agency&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors’ CEO resigned after the company’s own investigation found he had made misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;preorders for its electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, though the SEC and DOJ are still probing the startup. Canoo said as recently as November that it continues to cooperate with the SEC in its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea Nordmärke portable wireless charger details revealed by the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB3-NvcigpQ_FvfS2ecS77c3Jvw=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235102/ikea3.001.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FCC filing of the new IKEA Nordmärke portable qi wireless power bank | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCJz2L"&gt;Ikea is starting to distribute a new wireless charging puck with a built-in battery. The discovery of this Nordmärke-branded portable charger came from a reader of German tech news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mobiflip.de/shortnews/ikea-nordmaerke-qi-laden-akku/"&gt;mobiFlip&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who purchased the product from an Ikea in Cologne for €19.99 Euros ($22.57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIs6U"&gt;We couldn’t find any references to the new charger on Ikea’s website, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to locate &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108"&gt;the company’s filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, where the product is listed with ID FHO-E2108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is the Ikea wireless charging puck upside down and cut in half showing the electronics inside. Two yellow cylinders are visible which are the battery cells, covered in glue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OklXSNa1QgE4MhrfilNDbwKD9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066152/ikeachargerbatt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ikea Nordmärke wireless charger cut in half, presenting nonremovable 18650 cells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0u4NAK"&gt;The wireless charger carries the same label as Ikea’s other Qi-enabled wireless charging pads, which come in various circular and rectangular plastic bodies finished with materials such as cork and fabric. The new charger is also outfitted in gray fabric — but comes in a square shape and enough height to accommodate the batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qtRW4"&gt;The bottom of the charger mentions that the Li-ion battery’s capacity is 24Wh (6,500mAh) and uses a common 18650 cell. Based on the internal images, the charger contains two heavily adhered and soldered 18650 cells — rendering the batteries hardly user-replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wig6di"&gt;Ikea’s new charger, much like the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%2Fproducts%2F%3Fq%3Dwireless%2520charging&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22816581%2Fikea-nordmarke-portable-wireless-qi-charger-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677980/ikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture"&gt;wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt;, operates at a sleepy 5W rate. According to the FCC-filed &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108/Users-Manual/E2108-User-Manual-Rev1-5558655"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for this Nordmärke charger, the device needs a 10W USB-C power supply — but you’ll have to bring your own charging source and cable. Expect to start seeing these rolled out into Ikea stores in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ikea Nordmärke portable wireless charger manual describes how to charge and use the battery pack." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_k1quRfjXaTZSxkFQqC4MVU698=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067023/ikea_Nordm_rke_manual.jpg"&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Awakens is an interactive tech demo for PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zOb0W7TsB_IKl2m4ojwN0g1Ti8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234957/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_12_06_15_32_47.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CRcZ3y"&gt;Epic Games has created &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, an interactive tech demo built in Unreal Engine 5. A teaser for the interactive &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; experience appeared today, and the tech demo will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You can pre-install the demo right now (29GB) &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP1464-PPSA05754_00-MATRIXUNREALDEMO"&gt;on PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience%2F9ng8rk1f3hcc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820392%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and it will launch during The Game Awards on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDHLj"&gt;Members of the original movie team, including Lana Wachowski, have worked with Epic Games to create &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;. The Xbox store listing promises “a wild ride into the reality-bending universe of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; that features performances by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48ygme"&gt;The teaser video appears to show a digital version of Keanu Reeves and not the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; kind. “How do we know what is real?” Reeves asks, mysteriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o78Vss-KZD-gLf_5SU1Fvr8WNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067059/JC1uYno.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this another digital Keanu Reeves?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IkadvX"&gt;Epic Games originally announced its Unreal Engine 5 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;stunning PlayStation 5 tech demo last year&lt;/a&gt;. It included photo-realistic lighting, incredibly visual quality, and a level of game detail that Unreal Engine 5 promises to deliver for next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CKZni"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;tech demo could be equally impressive, with the teaser claiming it will offer “a glimpse into the future of interactive storytelling and entertainment with UE5 in this free, boundary-pushing cinematic and real-time tech demo.” It arrives just ahead of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; theater release on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches ‘ultra-fast’ delivery in NYC, with couriers who are actual employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZW2DE-pSXexPuT1uiM-gSumueY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234913/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash “fast” delivery comes to New York Cityfv | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cp4RR"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash has &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its “ultra-fast” DashMart delivery service in New York City because apparently delivery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;couriers aren’t already frazzled enough&lt;/a&gt; and no one can possibly wait more than 15 minutes for anything (not quite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95516647"&gt;what Andy Warhol predicted&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re way past that now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWBaqA"&gt;However, there is a key difference between the delivery jobs on the main DoorDash platform and positions with the new DashMart fast delivery service: DashMart workers will be part of what the company calls DashCorps, considered full- and part-time employees — instead of independent contractors — and many will be eligible for benefits. DashCorps workers will have set schedules and be paid $15 per hour, plus tips, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1"&gt;To start in NYC, the ultra-fast deliveries — which will arrive within 10 to 15 minutes of order times — will come from a DashMart location in Chelsea that’s open from 7AM to 2AM daily, with more locations to follow soon. The Chelsea DashMart has more than 2,000 items including fresh and frozen foods, household goods, and local products, the company says. Customers can order via the DoorDash app or website; those who have its DashPass membership won’t be charged delivery fees. DoorDash will donate excess DashMart produce to a local community food bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdCJlU"&gt;“Achieving ultra-fast delivery times inherently requires more structure and organization to ensure orders are fulfilled quickly and merchant and customer expectations are met,” the company’s director of new verticals Andrew Ladd &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. DashCorps workers will use a different app than workers for the standard DoorDash platform, wear uniforms, and in addition to deliveries, will perform other tasks including stocking shelves, customer support, and administrative work. The roles are “fundamentally different from dashing,” Ladd added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QZlF62"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cF3JbK"&gt;DoorDash first &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d"&gt;announced the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its DashMart stores in eight cities in August 2020. Unlike the Chelsea location, the first DashMarts didn’t have brick-and-mortar locations, functioning kind of like ghost kitchens for convenience stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23IllV"&gt;Why would someone want to continue working for the main DoorDash platform when the seemingly more attractive DashCorps jobs are available? Ladd writes that the “binary choice between working as an employee or an independent contractor” is “outdated and doesn’t reflect the needs of the modern workforce.” Its independent contractor “Dashers” prefer the flexibility over their schedules that DoorDash offers, the company claims, and “we’re steadfastly committed to protecting and strengthening this independent workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7iTA"&gt;The benefits for those DashCorps workers who are eligible would include those that “traditionally come with employment,” including medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAitFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Windows app will let you know if games play well on your PC before you download them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOC99JyvdYjl3fRkORcIM1QD7lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234866/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwRcqz"&gt;Microsoft is adding a simple label to its Xbox app for Windows, letting PC gamers know if a title runs well on their machine before they go ahead and download it. The feature is currently in testing and limited to certain games before it rolls out to all Xbox app users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLMSj5"&gt;While system requirements have always been listed in the Xbox app, this simple label should make it easier for PC owners to figure out if a game can run on their system. Microsoft is running a performance check against a variety of PC games to build this label.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxSy3sPOoZ4O-A-JqkF01Y-ttVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066897/qMewYBb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new label in the Xbox app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1RkvPc"&gt;There are a number of games that don’t have the label yet and simply show “performance check not available yet,” which suggests the Xbox app doesn’t just simply check your PC system requirements. It appears Microsoft is building its own database of how well PC games run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kpJpk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t officially detailed this new performance check yet, so it’s not clear if the label is based on the minimum specifications for a game, the recommended ones, or other system information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8psSXU"&gt;If the ratings are reliable, it could be an easy alternative to using third-party tools and websites like &lt;a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri"&gt;Can You Run It&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in trying out this new label or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791013/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-install-folders"&gt;ability to install PC games more freely&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is allowing everyone to test this new version of the Xbox app. All you need to do is download the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-insider-hub%2F9pldpg46g47z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Insider app&lt;/a&gt; and opt into the Windows gaming preview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp now lets you set all chats to disappear by default  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JVDz9wDJ7KBUiebHjbb2bQ0o7A=/0x0:3491x2327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234600/DisappearingMessagesComms_Web_Website_Static_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new features in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHLbm7"&gt;WhatsApp is adding new functionality to its &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages/?lang=en"&gt;disappearing messages feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users set messages in a chat to automatically be deleted after a set period of time. WhatsApp says users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages automatically for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;their new one-on-one chats, so that all future messages will be automatically deleted from the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5J9XD"&gt;The Meta-owned messaging service also says it’s giving users more options for how long before a message is deleted. When the feature first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;launched in November last year&lt;/a&gt;, users only had the option of having messages disappear after seven days. Going forward, however, there will also be the option of deleting them after just 24 hours or 90 days. The new functionality was previously reported as being in development &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-17-16-whats-new/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2dMbk0"&gt;WhatsApp notes that turning on disappearing messages by default won’t affect existing chats. When you start a new one-on-one chat, a notice will appear to say that the disappearing messages feature is turned on, alongside a note that says it’s on by default (so your contacts don’t think it’s anything personal). You also have the option of turning the setting off for individual chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcnyqR"&gt;Although the new default setting doesn’t affect group chats, WhatsApp says it’s added a new option when creating groups to let you enable the disappearing messages feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY8FLD"&gt;WhatsApp says the new features are available now across all platforms. Instructions for how to use them3m4 can be found in &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages"&gt;WhatsApp’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
