    <title>Google may be working on an answer to Apple’s device-locating network</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BED5OO"&gt;Google may be working on turning Android phones into a hivemind capable of finding lost devices, similar to Apple’s Find My network, according to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/18/google-spot-find-my-device-network/"&gt;analysis done by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; A toggle for the feature showed up in a beta of Google Play Services, with code referencing the ability for phones to help locate other devices, potentially signaling that Android phones could soon become easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4By43u"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the current Find My Device system can only find phones that are powered on, have a data or Wi-Fi signal, and have location services enabled. At this early stage, it’s unclear which, if any, of those limitations the relay network feature — apparently called Spot — would solve, but when you’re looking for a lost phone any advantage is good to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s26PeV"&gt;Google has other projects that involve using a network of Android phones — notably, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;earthquake detection feature&lt;/a&gt;. While the implementation is different, the underlying concept is likely very similar: there are more than 3 billion active Android devices, which is a large crowd to source information from, be it accelerometer data, or the location of a misplaced phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq0bvA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; did find a setting that would allow users to turn off the feature, making it so their phone wouldn’t help locate other devices. Given the limited information, it’s unclear whether the Find My Device network will be able to find things other than phones, like Apple’s Find My network or Samsung’s Galaxy Find network are capable of doing. And of course, this being unpacked code from a Beta release, these changes may never see an actual public release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZQdt3"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to request for comment about the prospective feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will bring picture-in-picture to iPhones and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTbV4Gq3GYbLqq25Wm1LBY-4ckM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473425/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rpYADg"&gt;The YouTube app on iOS &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/youtube-pip-support-rolling-out/"&gt;will be getting picture-in-picture support&lt;/a&gt;, allowing all users to watch videos while doing other things on their iPhones and iPads. A YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the feature is currently rolling out to Premium subscribers, and that a launch for all iOS users (including the free ones) in the US is in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqNyOh"&gt;Apple added support for picture-in-picture video for iPads with iOS 9, and brought it to iPhones with iOS 14. Since then, YouTube’s support for the feature on iPhones and iPads has been spotty — it works for iPad if you’re using Safari (though some have reported it doesn’t work &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252090452"&gt;for non-Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;); iPhone users have only been able to access the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9bg8b"&gt;That complication seems to be going away, at least for those in the US: iOS users, with or without a YouTube Premium subscription, will soon have access to it using the YouTube app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7552722"&gt;as Android users have for years&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube did not provide a timeline for when the feature would arrive for free users, but stated the rollout to Premium subscribes is in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4D2RE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article stated that PiP video came to the iPad with iOS 13. It in fact arrived with iOS 9. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We may have our first look at Ring’s Car Cam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IalUdbZ8NMSRrTZhYVATaYal06c=/0x12:592x407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473055/ring_car_cam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-06/rings-car-cam/" target="_blank"&gt;ZatzNotFunny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i45kax"&gt;We may have gotten our first look at Ring’s dashcam, &lt;a href="https://thetapedrive.com/amazon-plans-to-release-a-suite-of-ring-product-including-amazon-fetch-ring-auto-and-this-strange-looking-jaws-camera"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;The Tape Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which posted an image of a Ring-branded camera that looks like it’s made to fit on a car’s dashboard. Based on a support article which &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-06/rings-car-cam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zats Not Funny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered (and claims may have been published inadvertently) Ring’s Car Cam will have Alexa integration and the ability to start recording if you tell it you’ve been pulled over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kQGvm"&gt;The Car Cam was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;announced by the Amazon-owned company&lt;/a&gt; in September as a dashboard-mounted device which would record both the inside and outside of the vehicle, and was priced at $199. However, the &lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049596812-Ring-Car-Cam-Information"&gt;support article about the Car Cam&lt;/a&gt; that’s been posted on Ring’s site says that the camera attaches to the windshield as well. The design, as depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Tape Drive&lt;/em&gt;’s findings does seem like it could allow for that, if it comes apart into two pieces or extends. We’ll likely have to wait for an official announcement to get a good idea of how it works (and to see if this is actually an image of the Car Cam at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VotXVP"&gt;The support article confirms many of the features that were teased when Amazon announced the Car Cam last September, but reveals several new ones as well. It states that the camera will plug into your car’s OBD-II port, and that a subscription service isn’t required for the camera, as it saves videos locally, which you can access via Wi-Fi and the Ring app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dltIqs4jJ9PeUvgGJJ5LIYoNcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21905990/20200921_image_blog_car_cam_desktop_2x_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s announcement of the Car Cam included a picture of the Ring app showing footage from it, but not one of the device itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hANrMd"&gt;However, the document does say that some advanced features will require an optional Ring connectivity plan. The page doesn’t have a list of the features that will and won’t work without cellular connectivity, but it does say that LTE is required for the Emergency Crash Assist feature, where the camera will sense a car accident and have a Ring agent check on the driver and call 911 if needed. The article also says that cellular connectivity is required for saving videos to the cloud when the car is out and about, which could be helpful in the event that the car is stolen. According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;the initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; last year, the device will also hook into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; for connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgTzLv"&gt;There still isn’t any solid information about when the camera will be released, although Ring did say it would be some time this year. The support article, however, notes that the device hasn’t been cleared by the FCC yet, and won’t be available for sale until it is. We’ve reached out to Amazon for additional information on the Car Cam and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get a Tesla Model S Plaid to go from 0 to 60 in under 2 seconds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tr5npM1RNpc7R-gPpUthy3YXAQ=/112x0:1441x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69472545/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.51.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQSaBj"&gt;Tesla’s been talking up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527645/tesla-model-s-plaid-event-watch-how-to-start-time"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt; as “the quickest production car ever” claiming it can go from 0-60 in a blistering 1.99 seconds. It’s a claim that’s drawn a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yigpPSu_o"&gt;lot of raised eyebrows&lt;/a&gt; from car enthusiasts and experts. Can it &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;go that fast? Turns out, it can. But only under some incredibly specific Tesla-dictated conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H2ldH"&gt;That’s what &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;found when it got an exclusive chance to test out the Model S Plaid. Instead of letting the publication put the car through its paces on its usual test track, Tesla’s PR insisted that their drivers use a specific test track, and drive that track in a particular way. Under Tesla’s conditions, &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;went 0-60 in 1.98 seconds, running a quarter-mile in just 9.25 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJvAi"&gt;The entire review is &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2021/2022-tesla-model-s-plaid-first-test-review/"&gt;definitely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. But a key takeaway is that apparently, in order to hit that sub-two-second acceleration record, you’ll need the following ingredients: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="0QocHI"&gt; Find a dragstrip that’s willing to let you drive your Model S Plaid. This may be difficult, &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;points out, as most dragstrips will insist on following NHRA regulations that call for speedy cars like this have added safety features like a roll cage and window safety net. Tesla won’t be offering those features, &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CasCGg"&gt;If you do find a track willing to let you test your shiny new car’s zoom capability, make sure it has a surface prepped with a &lt;a href="https://fansided.com/2017/04/24/nascar-what-is-vht-bristol-motor-speedway/"&gt;grippy resin&lt;/a&gt; that will help the car launch even more quickly. Regular asphalt simply will &lt;em&gt;not do. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uN2pzY"&gt;Allow plenty of time if you want to go fast. You’re going to want to tell the car to switch into Drag Strip mode. The car will start prepping itself for the gauntlet you’re going to put it through. According to &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend: &lt;/em&gt;“Over the next eight to 15 minutes (the time needed varies), the car preconditions the powertrain for hard acceleration, heating or cooling the battery as needed and chilling the motors.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4iRIb"&gt;Once you’ve got Drag Strip engaged, you’re ready to...wait a little longer. Just a few more seconds this time! Hit the brake, hit the acceleration, let the car drop into a “cheetah stance” over 9 seconds. Just like a sprinter, it needs time to prep itself on the block. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sExUui"&gt;Ok, now go fast. Real fast. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="sXOTiS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: If you enrolled in an energy saver program, your smart thermostat may adjust itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Hg9JNt-JdMuQ31ww61smMIsNFA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69472181/dseifert_201115_4301_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Thermostat&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VW5PrM"&gt;Texas’ energy grid, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-freeze-power-grid-failure-electricity-market-incentives-11613777856"&gt;failed spectacularly over the winter&lt;/a&gt; during a stretch of historically cold weather, will be put to the test again this weekend, as temperatures across much of the state are forecast to be in the upper 90s. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/AbbottFailedTexas-ERCOT-heat-Texas-electricity-16249076.php"&gt;assurances from Gov. Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; that “everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid in Texas,” earlier this week the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ERCOT-issues-intermittent-conservation-alerts-16246788.php"&gt;urged customers to adjust thermostats&lt;/a&gt; to 78 degrees or higher and cut back on electricity use for several days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1FUqG"&gt;Texas residents with smart thermostats are &lt;a href="https://enrollmythermostat.com/faqs/texas-faq/"&gt;eligible for a number of programs&lt;/a&gt;, sweepstakes, and discounts which effectively allow energy providers to adjust their thermostats remotely during periods of high energy demand. Known as demand-response programs, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spavis/status/1405872205091704833?s=21"&gt;some Texans were taken by surprise&lt;/a&gt; this week, as their thermostats were turned up without any action from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yiwnqd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These discount programs give energy providers access to change your thermostat remotely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MF4FF"&gt;But that’s the way these Seasonal Savers programs, typically offered via utility companies across the country, are intended to work. Nest owners can also &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/seasonal-savings-nest-thermostat/"&gt;opt-in to Seasonal Savings directly via Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nest’s parent company, even if their local utility isn’t participating in such a program. Raising or lowering thermostats by a few degrees, can, in theory, reduce the strain on the energy grid and prevent the need for rolling blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6ADA"&gt;In Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/remote-thermostat-adjustment-texas-energy-shortage/285-5acf2bc5-54b7-4160-bffe-1f9a5ef4362a"&gt;according to news station KHOU&lt;/a&gt;, customers enrolled in the Smart Savers program in exchange for a sweepstakes entry. Some companies offer discounts or rebates on smart thermostat purchases, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/22/4253594/nest-adds-extra-features-and-rebate-in-power-company-partnerships"&gt;discounts on their electric bills&lt;/a&gt;. And, you can still adjust your thermostat manually if a remote adjustment is too high or too low for your comfort. You may end up playing a cat-and-mouse game with the remote controller, however, which could re-adjust the temperature as long as the high demand period persists. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Earth has been trapping heat at an alarming new rate, study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Summer weather in Leipzig" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TT_EOiCWwAy7Kq6JjlY15ZE-Yh4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69472125/1233519628.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A fountain in Leipzig, Germany on June 18, 2021 | Photo by Sebastian Willnow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ShhvKr"&gt;The amount of heat trapped by Earth’s land, ocean, and atmosphere doubled over the course of just 14 years, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOG71H"&gt;To figure out how much heat the earth was trapping, researchers looked at NASA satellite measurements that tracked how much of the Sun’s energy was entering Earth’s atmosphere and how much was being bounced back into space. They compared this with data from NOAA buoys that tracked ocean temperatures — which gives them an idea of how much heat is getting absorbed into the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOg2oY"&gt;The difference between the amount of heat absorbed by Earth, and the amount reflected back into space is called an energy imbalance. In this case, they found that from 2005 to 2019, the amount of heat absorbed by Earth was going up. Their results &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL093047"&gt;were published&lt;/a&gt; in Geophysical Research Letters this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3LA4G"&gt;“The two very independent ways of looking at changes in Earth’s energy imbalance are in really, really good agreement, and they’re both showing this very large trend, which gives us a lot of confidence that what we’re seeing is a real phenomenon and not just an instrumental artifact,” said Norman Loeb, a NASA researcher and the lead author for the study &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/joint-nasa-noaa-study-finds-earths-energy-imbalance-has-doubled"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “The trends we found were quite alarming in a sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An animated gif showing a graph of planetary heat uptake vs radiation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Px_XW2bjcjNa4IVO6pU96q8LgqQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666998/figure_1_v2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/Tim Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A graph of the study’s results showing the trend upward over time. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uSQvfA"&gt;The researchers think that the reason the Earth is holding on to more heat comes down to a few different factors. One is human-caused climate change. Among other problems, the more greenhouse gases we emit, the more heat they trap. It gets worse when you take into account that increasing heat also melts ice and snow. Ice and snow can help the planet reflect heat back into space — as they disappear, more heat can be absorbed by the land and oceans underneath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUiG2k"&gt;There’s another factor at play too — natural changes to a climate pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Between 2014 and 2019, the pattern was in a ‘warm phase’ which caused fewer clouds to form. That &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;meant more heat could be absorbed by the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSbIVQ"&gt;More than likely, it’s the combination of climate change with those natural shifts that made such a big difference to Earth’s energy balance, Loeb says. “And over this period they’re both causing warming, which leads to a fairly large change in Earth’s energy imbalance. The magnitude of the increase is unprecedented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KKWdL"&gt;Fourteen years isn’t a long time compared to Earth’s long climate history — researchers will have to keep gathering data to get more information about how this fits into the complete picture of the planet’s energy imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQWWUr"&gt;“My hope is the rate that we’re seeing this energy imbalance subsides in the coming decades,” Loeb &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/17/us/earth-trapped-heat-doubled/index.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, we’re going to see more alarming climate changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This alien-like metal may one day power your electronics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Thvze9CSJjdTMY7m9LZlCQjQwnU=/186x0:1806x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471948/Bismuth_1_Textless.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLsabN"&gt;Bismuth is a heavy, brittle metal that forms colorful geometric crystals when melted and then slowly cooled. It’s most commonly known as a main ingredient in Pepto Bismol — less commonly known as bismuth subsalicylate. And someday soon, it might be used to help power your electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC05VW"&gt;Scientists like &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.hoye"&gt;Robert Hoye&lt;/a&gt;, a lecturer in the department of materials at Imperial College London, are using bismuth-based compounds in photovoltaics — materials that convert light into energy. Bismuth has unique electronic properties that not only make it a good candidate for solar cells, but make it great for &lt;em&gt;indoor&lt;/em&gt; use — a place where traditional photovoltaics don’t perform too well. That means it might one day replace the need for batteries in billions of indoor electronics, like home sensors and health monitors, says Hoye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rII1F0"&gt;Aside from its ability to absorb light, bismuth makes for an ideal battery replacement because it’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170718113713.htm"&gt;completely nontoxic&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other metals which can harm people and the environment, bismuth is benign. If it ends up in a landfill, it won’t leach toxic metals into soil and water — a real problem with current electronics that contain metals such as lead, cadmium, and tellurium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqoJG0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; brought some raw bismuth to Staten Island’s MakerSpace to grow some other-worldly crystals, and we spoke to Robert Hoye about the exciting future possibilities for this unique and often under-appreciated element. Watch our latest video above to see what we discovered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company reportedly pitching wider tunnels that could transport freight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvrU1_UP-WzoDaadGqQkgpBeLKE=/0x512:1536x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471851/elon_musk_the_boring_company_tunnel_photo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nUUUvq"&gt;The Boring Company has been pitching potential clients on a much wider tunnel than any it has built so far, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/elon-musk-s-boring-co-pitches-double-wide-tunnels?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, which could be used to transport freight. Since its inception in 2016, the Elon Musk-helmed tunneling startup has been focused on tunnels that would transport passengers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17464612/boring-company-chicago-elon-musk-cost-estimate"&gt;with a goal&lt;/a&gt; to “solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic” in cities. But the new pitch deck &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; obtained shows how wider tunnels could be used for transporting freight, something that would greatly expand Boring’s potential business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwfo5K"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the company’s new pitch includes tunnels that are 21 feet in diameter, nearly twice the size of the 12-foot tunnels the company has built so far, which could accommodate two shipping containers side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l27yRE"&gt;The company most recently completed 1.7 miles of tunnel under Las Vegas. That’s part of a larger proposal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;build a massive tunnel system running under the whole city&lt;/a&gt;, including the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran International Airport. The Boring Company has claimed such a system could handle roughly 50,000 passengers per hour. The current tunnel under Las Vegas is meant to eventually transport some 4,400 people each hour, but a &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; report suggested that company documents show it may only be &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised/"&gt;able to transport 1,200&lt;/a&gt; people per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzoNfS"&gt;The Boring Company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Apple TV 4K and Sony’s XM3 headphones are discounted ahead of Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WLrvpQfYQKxWsuAq9hJ2LiA9qes=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471815/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wT5e8"&gt;Prime Day 2021 is kicking off in just a few days. Prime members will get to enjoy exclusive tech and gaming discounts on Amazon. In addition, other retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target will each be having deals of their own that don’t require a subscription. We’ll be covering the deals in-depth starting Monday morning, June 21st, so join us then. We’re collecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"&gt;best early Prime Day deals&lt;/a&gt; right here, but here are a few more excellent deals to take us into the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4m29Ss"&gt;Through Sunday, people who sign up for a free My Best Buy account can get $150 off most of Apple’s last-gen iPad Pro in both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes. This limited-time price cut results in the best prices we’ve seen for the Wi-Fi and LTE-connected tablets. To give you a sense of the prices, the base 11-inch model with 128GB of storage costs $600 — the same price as the iPad Air with half that amount of storage. The 256GB 11-inch model is just $100 more at $700. If you want a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 128GB base model costs $850.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBwD3M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="d67eBk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5xqw7z"&gt;The latest Apple TV 4K model that has the A12 Bionic processor, 32GB of storage, and the improved Siri Remote included has been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0933D3SN6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted for the first time at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, it’s a small price cut of just $10, but it’s rare to see any discount on brand-new Apple products. Doubling the storage costs just $20. If you want to read more about this model, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;my colleague Chris Welch’s review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LGU8Te"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFkXKN"&gt;The digital version of Paper Mario: The Origami King for the Nintendo Switch is discounted at several retailers (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15094171-paper-mario-the-origami-king-switch-digital-version-41-99?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Normally $60, you can snag a copy from Amazon, Target, Best Buy, or GameStop for $42, which is the lowest price we’ve seen yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;We called it a “laugh-out-loud funny RPG”&lt;/a&gt;, and its clever origami art style lends itself to interesting battles and environmental set pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kwYeSE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kFWkiQ"&gt;Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling headphones are just $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for the black model. Originally $350, this is the lowest price that we’ve seen for new models at major retailers. The differences between this and the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XM4&lt;/a&gt; are minor, depending on who you ask. They look identical and have the same fantastic sound quality, but the XM4 feature an improved noise cancellation effect and microphone performance, a “remove to pause” feature, and they support two concurrent Bluetooth connections. Those are great features to have and are worth the extra money for some, but if you can live without them, the XM3 is about as good as you can get for this price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="csNyXe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="fWYISr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywjAHJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Windows 11 leaks, RCS encryption, and this week in antitrust policy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mES6inNuIWBaV-h3jetINJI0G-g=/0x86:1280x939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471726/windows11_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbbaiR"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l21oub"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/7asgS5F7kQYJsZJfgKFVnb" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TPljHB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjbWlv"&gt;In this episode, the show is split into three sections. First, Nilay and Dieter talk to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren about this week in Microsoft: leaks of the Windows 11 UI, announcements from E3 2021, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella doubling as the company’s chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lZIT7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 leak reveals new UI, Start menu, and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QTdpV7"&gt;In section two of the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; politics reporter Makena Kelly returns to explain the continuing push by the US government to enact antitrust legislation on tech monopolies — this week, five new bills were introduced and the Senate confirmed a new commissioner of the FTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OpGhbA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Tech antitrust pioneer Lina Khan will officially lead the FTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="97Vqbr"&gt;In part 3, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz joins in to chat about this week in gadgets and Google — the company is adding end-to-end encryption to their Messages app, Sonos officially announced their picture frame speaker, and Telsa’s Model S Plaid made its big debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
