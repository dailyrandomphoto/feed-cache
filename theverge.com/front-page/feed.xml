    <title>Facebook releases a report on the most-viewed content in News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GkyEO"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; to show what content was most widely viewed by Americans in the last quarter, and the list includes a post from President Biden, a video from 5-Minute Crafts, and arguments about whether you should put sugar on spaghetti. Facebook’s report comes as a response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10/status/1428031221875961858?s=20"&gt;frequent reports&lt;/a&gt; that some of the platform’s posts with the most interaction are from right-wing sources that critics say could have a radicalizing effect on users. Facebook says that the report shows what people actually see on the platform, as opposed to what content on Facebook gets the most interaction, and that it’ll be creating these reports on a quarterly basis in the future. However, the picture the report paints is, by Facebook’s own admission, an incomplete one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGbDjj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;Wednesday’s report&lt;/a&gt; covers the public News Feed content seen by Facebook’s US viewers between the beginning of April and the end of June. It contains sections including showing the top 20 domains, links, pages, and posts in terms of views. Facebook also &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/companion-guide/"&gt;released a companion guide&lt;/a&gt; that describes how it got and analyzed the data for the report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cB-ZUonIVAFD-cV6LOjJyRUzmeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790432/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_10.16.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Post: Gaur Gopal Das&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook says this post had 80.6 million viewers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7bTfl"&gt;According to the report, the most-viewed post is a letter scramble that invites users to pick out the first three words they see. The second most-viewed posts asks users over 30 to post a picture of themselves if they look young. Facebook has the full list of posts, along with links and screenshots, in its report, which &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;you can view here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLTAGK"&gt;Looking through Facebook’s lists, it’s all rather tame stuff. The most-viewed domains (which shows which websites’ links were the most viewed, as opposed to which specific links got the most eyes) include sites like YouTube, UNICEF, Spotify, and CBS News, while the most-viewed pages include a page called “Woof Woof” and “Kitchen Fun With My 3 Sons.” The seventh most-viewed link is &lt;a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2d32d91bcdfa6e17f18df90f1fada473/6094b00761d82f16-76/s400x600/f0383899ecb1484b10e3420a368d871d7dc68f91.gifv"&gt;an adorable GIF of kittens&lt;/a&gt;, and the third is &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/coronavirus/unicef-responding-covid-19-india"&gt;UNICEF’s response page for India’s COVID-19 crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A0PXgQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says it wants to give an “accurate representation” of the platform’s content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uEQlHX"&gt;For some, this may seem surprising or suspect. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/22/21332774/facebook-crowdtangle-kevin-roose-nyt-tweets-interactions-reach-engagement"&gt;heard before&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s own tools show that right-wing content from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/19/1013793067/outrage-as-a-business-model-how-ben-shapiro-is-using-facebook-to-build-an-empire"&gt;Ben Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; and Sean Hannity is what captures the most interaction from the site’s users, and Facebook is reportedly well aware of that perception. In July, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ran a story that described how data published by journalists &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;led to a battle within the company&lt;/a&gt; about whether it should be as open as possible with what its users engage with, or if limiting access to that data made Facebook look good. As the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; put it, it was a clash between transparency and image management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCEKyu"&gt;Facebook denied that characterization then, and it still does. “The narrative that has emerged is quite simply wrong,” Facebook’s VP of integrity, Guy Rosen, said on a call with reporters Wednesday. He added that the goal of releasing the data is to give an “accurate representation” of content on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNy2Xq"&gt;While the report’s contents may be interesting, they’re not exactly representative of everything that Facebook users actually see. Facebook itself says in the report that the top posts were less than 0.1 percent of the content viewed by the site’s US users. According to the report, the percentage is similar for the top 20 links as well, though the domains made up for 1.9 percent of US news feed content views.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qeuiJEQGuBbkGick1W2azNf-ofU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790321/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_9.30.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graphic: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content that links out to other sites doesn’t make up a large portion of the views.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N9qntC"&gt;Another caveat is that the views Facebook’s report show are the ones for public content — things shared in private groups or on private profiles aren’t included, as Facebook says that would be a violation of privacy. Groups specifically, though, are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/7/9/20686955/facebook-groups-border-patrol-anti-vaxx-misogyny"&gt;seen as a large source of misinformation and bad behavior&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, and the company has had to continuously navigate how to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22436973/facebook-myanmar-military-coup-ban-arakan-army-resistance"&gt;enforce existing rules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;create new ones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443742/facebook-health-groups-recommendations-new-admin-rules"&gt;manage them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AC6yhc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The News Feed is personalized, so we’re only seeing a sliver of what Facebook’s users are scrolling past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fIJ9b"&gt;All this goes to say that, while &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/"&gt;the report from Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is interesting to look through, it’s important to keep in mind what it is and what it isn’t. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/what-do-people-actually-see-on-facebook-in-the-us/"&gt;been very clear&lt;/a&gt; that there’s a difference between what people see on Facebook and what they interact with, and this report really only touches on the former. There is an argument to be made, though, that what people interact with is what will actually affect them the most — you’re more likely to remember something you commented on than something you scrolled past. Plus, as noted before, the report only shows a tiny slice of News Feed views — with Facebook’s users getting a custom news feed, Facebook can only really summarize so much, which ends up leaving out a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is making it easier for other apps to point to Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgb5Ikdw8tLo_ppZXIxSWNgr0y8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69743550/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HeaGVe"&gt;Twitter is updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;its API v2&lt;/a&gt; so that developers can look up its Spaces social audio rooms, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2021/shape-the-future-of-twitter-spaces"&gt;the company announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, which could allow them to share information about Spaces more easily outside the Twitter app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YaQ1K"&gt;Twitter has been rapidly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;improving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, but before now, you could only see them on Twitter’s own apps. But starting Wednesday, “all developers using the new Twitter API v2 will be able to look up live or scheduled Spaces using criteria like Spaces ID, user ID, or keyword,” Twitter says, which sounds like it means that a developer can use that information to point you to a Space from within their own app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kbVUZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can still only attend a Space on Twitter, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXMY9p"&gt;This doesn’t appear to mean that developers will be able to let you listen to or attend Spaces inside their apps, however — it sounds like you’ll still only be able to attend a Space on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBx9lX"&gt;Despite that limitation, the new features could be an enticing carrot for developers to adopt Twitter’s API v2, the company’s rebuilt API that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"&gt;launched in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3263481/twitter-api-third-party-developers"&gt;For some time&lt;/a&gt;, the company opted to limit how developers could build upon Twitter and integrate it into their services and apps, but the ongoing updates to API v2 seem to signal that Twitter is continuing to welcome developers into the fold once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cryptocurrency supporters are in the middle of their first big fight in Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I32TNgGDYO53w3EKnQhm3F0G66Q=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69743504/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KjAtyn"&gt;Last week, the Senate approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618448/senate-bipartisan-infrastructure-package-schumer-broadband-cryptocurrency"&gt;a massive infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; making serious investments in building out the US’s roads and bridges. It would be the largest domestic spending bill in almost a decade, and nearly every powerful lobbying shop circled Washington for months trying to shape its language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Wu0XB"&gt;But one industry was surprisingly thrown into the fight last minute: cryptocurrency. When the Senate finally announced the bill text earlier this month, it included a provision that could impose devastating new tax requirements for wallet developers and miners. Suddenly, the cryptocurrency industry and its few lobbying shops faced one of its largest regulatory threats ever. They needed all of the digital foot soldiers they could get to help rally senators and fix the problematic language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svY74v"&gt;So, they turned to their vast and vocal online community of investors and posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAXFW5"&gt;“We are at an advantage in grassroots organizing because we’re a structurally networked community,” Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications for Coin Center, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Everybody in cryptocurrency knows everybody else for the most part so information moves really fast across various social channels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fknPJO"&gt;Advocacy groups and blockchain organizations were quickly able to direct their grassroots digital community’s energy toward the fight. Fight for the Future and the Electronic Frontier Foundation were able to prompt more than 40,000 calls to senators ahead of the bill’s final vote on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ucDbj"&gt;High-profile celebrities and influencers like Ashton Kutcher and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also came out in opposition of the bill, posting tweets prompting their followers to call on their senators to fix the language. These tweets inspired other community members to take part in the effort by making calls and posting their own tweets with information from Fight for the Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FjeuCo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reason this even became a conversation in Washington was because of Twitter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdPiTv"&gt;“Senators who were probably not even paying very much attention to this section of the infrastructure bill suddenly saw their Twitter feeds swamped with messages from their own constituents,” said Rainey Reitman, EFF’s chief program officer. “It was so much they couldn’t ignore it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNBLOI"&gt;“The reason this even became a conversation in Washington was because of Twitter,” Reitman continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ost6NT"&gt;Even crypto-focused YouTubers and TikTok accounts pivoted toward advocacy, informing their followers about the bill and how it could affect the industry. One TikTok user posted a video dancing behind text that said, “Dance if ur an 87 year old senator single-handedly ruining the economy over a $50 billion military dispute,” calling out Sen. Richard Shelby’s (R-AL) objection to an amendment to fix the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFbLo9"&gt;It’s a surprising shift for an industry that has typically been an outsider in Washington, often directly opposed to well-established players like law enforcement and the banking industry. But as digital assets companies have been drawn into regulatory fights, they’ve had to engage with the process to defend themselves, whether against regulators calling for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;more authority&lt;/a&gt; over the industry or a growing concern over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbBxbr"&gt;The new push drew heavily on infrastructure from previous online organizing drives. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745974/net-neutrality-day-of-action-tech-companies"&gt;2017 net neutrality fight&lt;/a&gt; was fought largely online with organizations like Fight for the Future and EFF using social media to prompt internet users to get involved in a policy battle that affected their favorite websites. Once the controversial language was added to the infrastructure bill, those same groups used the tactics they’d perfected in the net neutrality fight to push back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZrmM9"&gt;Reitman says the shift to digital organizing has also been a factor, as cryptocurrency fans “are using online platforms like Twitter and &lt;em&gt;Hacker News&lt;/em&gt; to educate themselves, educate other people, and then start speaking out about regulation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zBJ9h"&gt;Even with the heightened political pressure, it’s too early to say where Congress will land on the new cryptocurrency rules. Cryptography groups failed to stop the provisions in the Senate, and all hopes now rest on stripping the language from the House version of the bill. As of publication, it’s unclear if congresspeople will have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/house-democrats-disagree-over-infrastructure-bill-vote-strategy.html"&gt;one last opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to amend the bill before it reaches its final vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48n9Hp"&gt;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) faces an uphill battle in passing the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-faces-infrastructure-squeeze-between-moderates-progressives-n1276910"&gt;infrastructure package at all&lt;/a&gt;. Progressive members say they won’t vote for the Senate-passed $1 trillion package unless it’s tied to a broader $3.5 trillion social services bill. Some moderate Democrats pushed back, saying they wouldn’t vote to begin writing the larger bill unless the infrastructure package is approved first. If the two bills get tied together, it could make it harder for any lawmaker to bring an amendment to change the cryptocurrency language to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiBrsV"&gt;Still, last week’s organizing efforts proved that the cryptocurrency community has grown into an impressive political force in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfGz5Z"&gt;“It was really amazing to see how quickly they were able to turn that functionality on and get so many people involved,” Kristin Smith, executive director at the Blockchain Association said. “It’s definitely a turning point for the industry and I think one that will hopefully lead to better policy down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDqaBS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2feKt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators ask FTC to investigate Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ promises</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFg7-OsKQJFW48cWR3dYFltJnWU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69743331/akrales_170414__1610_0497.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BoKsid"&gt;Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have asked new Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to investigate Tesla’s marketing of its advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot. The Senators are particularly concerned with how Tesla has been charging customers thousands of dollars for what it refers to as “Full Self-Driving capability,” despite the fact that buying that package does not make the company’s cars fully autonomous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2muSsc"&gt;“Tesla’s marketing has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road,” the senators &lt;a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-and-blumenthal-call-for-ftc-investigation-into-teslas-misleading-advertising-of-driving-automation-systems"&gt;wrote in a letter published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “Accordingly, we urge you to open an investigation into potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla’s advertising and marketing of its driving automation systems and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure the safety of all drivers on the road.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlISKh"&gt;The letter comes as the Biden administration has been steadily increasing the scrutiny of tech companies. Much of that focus to date has been through the lens of antitrust policy — especially at the FTC under Khan — but Tesla has drawn some heat as well. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;an investigation into Autopilot’s tendency to crash into parked emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p6WXus"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The request comes days after safety regulators announced a new probe into Autopilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gScCGn"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spent years claiming that his company’s cars were on the verge of being able to drive themselves without any human intervention, though that functionality has never arrived. In 2015, he said fully autonomous Teslas &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/"&gt;were just two years away&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, Tesla announced that all its new cars &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware"&gt;had the hardware required to accomplish this&lt;/a&gt;, and that the company just needed a little more time to dial in the software. That turned out to not be true, as Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;has since created a new&lt;/a&gt; computer that these older cars would need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aMiHF"&gt;At the same time, Tesla started offering customers a “Full Self-Driving” option when they bought their cars, essentially asking them to prepay for one day having a fully autonomous car. In exchange, these owners would get more advanced capabilities than what is offered in the standard Autopilot suite as Tesla developed them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6TP9N"&gt;In late 2018, Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/20/18000884/tesla-full-self-driving-option-gone-musk-autopilot"&gt;pulled this option from its website&lt;/a&gt;, with Musk admitting that it caused “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053068635940388865"&gt;too much confusion&lt;/a&gt;.” But just a few months later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245370/tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-musk-2019"&gt;it was back&lt;/a&gt;, and Musk again promised that full autonomy would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245370/tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-musk-2019"&gt;available by the end of 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEWzY9"&gt;Since then, Tesla has continued to charge money for the “Full Self-Driving” option — the price currently stands at $10,000 if you buy it when you buy one of the company’s cars, though Tesla also recently started selling “subscriptions” to the Full Self-Driving package if owners want it after purchase. The company is explicit on its website that the option &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot#usingautopilot"&gt;does not make its cars fully autonomous&lt;/a&gt;, though as of writing it still promises the functionality will be available by year’s end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYO5sR"&gt;Even then, Musk now says a “feature-complete” version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1354576531029430272"&gt;is defined as&lt;/a&gt; the car being able to drive someone from home to work “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature%2Dcomplete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;most likely without interventions&lt;/a&gt;,” which does not describe a fully autonomous vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iL91Gm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla once pulled the “Full Self-Driving” option from its website because of “confusion”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KFH7MJ"&gt;Tesla has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;beta testing&lt;/a&gt; this more “feature-complete” version of the Full Self-Driving software for months now, with a few thousand owners in the program running the software on roads across the country. Many of these owners have filmed their experiences with the software, which gets updated every few weeks or months. The results are a mixed bag; for every &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPGTOJ5Nks"&gt;intervention-free video&lt;/a&gt; of a Tesla gliding through a cityscape, there’s another where the car &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Ill_OYZTI"&gt;refuses to take a left turn&lt;/a&gt; or dives toward &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-fsd-full-self-driving-videos-flaws-glitches-2021-7"&gt;oncoming traffic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfSqFt"&gt;Musk’s many claims, as well as the beta, and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlThdr3O5Qo"&gt;video released in 2019&lt;/a&gt; showing an early version of the Full Self-Driving software navigating roads in the San Francisco Bay Area make up the bulk of what the Senators cite in their letter. They also say Tesla has been misleading in its advertising of Autopilot and Full Self-Driving — though the company doesn’t engage in traditional advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvHB8V"&gt;“We fear that Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features are not as mature and reliable as the company pitches to the public,” the Senators wrote. “Tesla drivers listen to these claims and believe their vehicles are equipped to drive themselves – with potentially deadly consequences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlRMQC"&gt;Safety advocates and other regulators have long pushed for more scrutiny over the way Tesla treats its driver assistance technology. In early 2020, the National Transportation Board found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;the design of Autopilot and overconfidence in its abilities&lt;/a&gt; were what led to a fatal crash in Mountain View, California. Musk has even admitted that drivers can get too complacent when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt;using Tesla’s driver assistance features&lt;/a&gt;. But for years, he’s only allowed a passive form of driver monitoring when Autopilot is engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFCC4E"&gt;Charging thousands of dollars for a feature that doesn’t wholly exist while also beta testing it in the real world, after spending years of moving the target for creating an autonomous car, is certainly still causing confusion like the kind that once made Musk step back from the Full Self-Driving option. In Wednesday’s letter, Markey and Blumenthal mistakenly say that the Full Self-Driving beta software is now available to “all Tesla owners” through a subscription. That promise, like many others Musk has made, has not yet been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Taliban may have seized biometric data that can ID US allies in Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US And Afghan Forces Man Border Crossing With Pakistan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8aXThOlPmJHK7D-QpHCvIkaNBU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69743101/122259189.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Moore/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="171QZO"&gt;The US military created a vast database of biometric data — one report suggests it had a goal of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956705029/first-platoon-examines-how-war-on-terror-birthed-pentagons-biometrics-id-system"&gt;25 million entries&lt;/a&gt; — as part of its effort to track terrorists in Afghanistan. Now that the US has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/15/22626082/kabul-capital-fall-afghanistan-government-taliban-forces-explained"&gt;withdrawn from the country&lt;/a&gt;, reports from &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/08/17/afghanistan-taliban-military-biometrics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-tech-conflict/afghans-scramble-to-delete-digital-history-evade-biometrics-idUSL8N2PO1FH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the Taliban could potentially use it to target allies left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpiXoH"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes, the collection of biometric data &lt;a href="https://www.army.mil/article/32609/bats_helps_id_insurgents_hostages"&gt;was primarily billed as a military project&lt;/a&gt;, but Afghan civilians who worked for US embassies and the broader coalition government were reportedly also included in the database. The biometric information that could be on file for those people varies: the Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment (HIIDE) used by the military collects everything from iris scans to fingerprints, along with identifying biographical information, according to the sources &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; spoke to. Those devices are now reportedly in the Taliban’s possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7I3cIJ"&gt;There’s some conflicting information on whether the Taliban can actually access and take action with the information that’s been collected, however. “The Taliban doesn’t have the gear to use the data,” a former Army Special Operations official told &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;. Accessing the biometric data that’s been collected might then fall to others, like Pakistan’s intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters, &lt;/em&gt;local reports said the Taliban has used government biometric data in the last five years to “target members of the security forces, checking their fingerprints against a database,” which only clouds things further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wyy8D"&gt;However urgent the immediate risk is, the possibility of widespread abuse of the collected data makes evading biometric scanning and securing civilians’ digital identities all the more important. Human rights organization Human Rights First has published guides on &lt;a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/evading-misuse-biometric-data"&gt;biometric recognition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/steps-protect-your-online-identity-taliban-digital-history-and-evading-biometrics-abuses"&gt;protecting digital identities&lt;/a&gt; in English, Farsi, and Pashto that should be a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aTWBtPwZTKbOu1r44PjNSdICUk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742617/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.12.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsLXHf"&gt;It’s been almost a year since Apple first debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;the iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe accessory system&lt;/a&gt;. So where are all the MagSafe chargers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDOKq4"&gt;Don’t get me wrong. There are plenty of accessory developers making cases, wallets, car mounts, desk stands, and even magnetic Qi chargers and battery packs that &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; with MagSafe — but almost no actual MagSafe accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp2oo1"&gt;And that’s a big difference because of how Apple has designed the MagSafe standard. Anyone can wirelessly charge an iPhone 12 device using a Qi charger at Apple’s standard rate of 7.5W. Magnets, being a physical phenomenon, are even more universal, meaning that device manufacturers can easily stick an iPhone 12 and a Qi charger together. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;Many already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bevw0"&gt;But those two things alone don’t make a wireless charger a MagSafe charger; actual, Apple-approved MagSafe chargers offer a charging speed that’s twice as fast, up to 15W. And that’s only available on a paltry handful of accessories: Apple’s official charging cable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s official MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt; (even then, only when it’s plugged in), and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;pair of pricey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin stands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS3fDO"&gt;Theoretically, there’s no reason that Apple &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to restrict 15W charging to official MagSafe chargers. Any number of Qi chargers are available that offer 15W charging speeds and work with a plethora of devices. Some of them are even made by Apple’s MagSafe-approved partners, leading to awkward product lineups where some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fmagsafe-magnetic-accessories%2Fmagsafe%2Fboost-charge-pro-2-in-1-wireless-charger-stand-with-magsafe-15w%2Fp%2Fp-wiz010%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-capable 15W chargers&lt;/a&gt; sit side by side on a website with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fchargers%2Fwireless%2Fcharging-stands-docks%2Fboost-charge-magnetic-wireless-charger-stand-7-5w%2Fp%2Fp-wib003%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identical-looking 7.5W, MagSafe-compatible wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt; that won’t charge your phone as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_18Q9UHe7v_NvLYlHc2hVQdvL54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788687/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Belkin charger has MagSafe, costs $99, and charges an iPhone 12 at 15W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GIDwlhonrFGCRfdMXc42emXLDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788689/webdam.web.1000.1000__1_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Belkin charger has magnets, costs $35, and charges an iPhone 12 at 7.5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB2GVg"&gt;The reason appears to be simple: &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;Apple hasn’t actually let anyone else&lt;/a&gt; make MagSafe chargers yet. &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a wireless-charging-focused site that’s obtained details and a unit for Apple’s MagSafe modules — Apple is only allowing MagSafe chargers to be built using &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/teardown-of-apple-official-15w-magsafe-module/"&gt;an MFi-approved module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ooeeb"&gt;Much like the Apple Watch charger (and to some extent, Lighting cables), Apple works with factories to provide the basic parts here, which developers can then integrate into a charging station or mount. Technically, there’s not a huge difference between offering a slot for a MagSafe cable versus the integrated module; the advantage is largely in size and cost, allowing for accessories that are smaller, cheaper, and nicer to use than the awkward, kludged-together options we have today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnqAn7VxyxBOup03H8QBLPG85ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788701/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_5.56.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/dont-let-third-parties-confuse-you-about-apples-magsafe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Apple’s MagSafe module for device makers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2KTD7A"&gt;But crucially, the company only announced that it would be offering the modules &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;on June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the iPhone 12 launched. Hardware developers were only then able to apply to get their hands on samples and apply to get true MagSafe products approved (which will presumably take even more time), followed by actually manufacturing and shipping those accessories, which could take months by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR8Sx1"&gt;It’s a similar timetable that we’ve seen with other proprietary Apple chargers. Apple didn’t offer developers the option to build their own integrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9023443/apple-watch-charging-stands-mfi-program"&gt;until July 2015&lt;/a&gt;, four months after the Watch hit the market, and it took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12271108/diskus-apple-watch-cable-third-party-charger"&gt;almost a year after that&lt;/a&gt; until the first third-party products arrived with the proprietary charger built in. Those products have proven to be excellent options for consumers, offering functionality that Apple didn’t, like integration with other wireless charging pads, removable cables, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/zens-apple-watch-power-bank/"&gt;or a built-in power bank&lt;/a&gt;. But because of how Apple’s system works, it took months for them to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07iaLL"&gt;Or take USB-C to Lightning cables, where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;first started selling&lt;/a&gt; its own models in fall of 2016 — but only opened the gates to developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/04/mfi-lightning-to-usb-c-cables-early-2019/"&gt;in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with the first cables showing up a few months later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/15/18183251/anker-usb-c-to-lightning-cables-release-date"&gt;in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1m8ul"&gt;Each time, that slow start has had direct consequences: a lack of diversity and competition in the products you can buy. Apple’s virtual monopoly on accessories in the first months or years means customers have fewer — and worse — options for their brand-new iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNFXr"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231718/magsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process"&gt;still no MagSafe car mounts&lt;/a&gt; that will charge your iPhone 12 at full speed, even a year after launch — perhaps the most blindingly obvious use of MagSafe. The closest Apple-sanctioned accessory is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;magnetic car mount&lt;/a&gt; that just holds up (but doesn’t charge) your phone. And if you want a MagSafe charger for your desk or nightstand that can prop your iPhone up, you’re limited to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2F3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand-magsafe-apple-exclusive%3Fcpn%3D12608711214%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw3_KIBhA2EiwAaAAlimkyPkeNamF7rAVdkW8eCMAHyfvjyAeo2y9m2RW2yf7UOV3mIn4WHxoCJbQQAvD_BwE%26kw%3D%26mkwid%3D_dc%26pcrid%3D509075182700%26pkw%3D%26pmt%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bulkier workarounds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fforte-for-iphone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that require&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/magsafe-mount-silver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threading through&lt;/a&gt; an existing Apple-bought cable (or Belkin’s two options, which are usually even pricier). Apple spent the better part of the year without giving access to developers to build their own products, while also not working to build anything on its own to fill those niches, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B1PBRs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iML5YK"&gt;And while developers can try to keep up with Apple, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;Anker’s MagSafe-compatible battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, they’re not playing on a level field without access to the MagSafe modules that Apple is rationing out. Forget Apple’s software additions that make its MagSafe battery pack more useful than a third-party option: right now, Apple’s pack is the only one that can even charge an iPhone at full speed, and even then, only while it’s plugged in with specific adapters and capable cords. It’s the sort of area where competition could lead to better products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyr6PY"&gt;Maybe a third-party can figure out a way to provide full-speed charging from a battery pack that Apple didn’t, or simply offer things at a lower price point or with a larger battery than Apple’s pack offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DNzDx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyjqMY"&gt;That, of course, assumes that Apple even lets competitors make officially approved MagSafe battery packs. The company’s MFi program means that developers have to get their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;hardware approved by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and be built using Apple-approved parts from Apple-approved factories. (Apple also gets a fee from each product, of course.) And if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;company doesn’t like a design&lt;/a&gt;, it can simply &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;withhold its seal of approval&lt;/a&gt; and the necessary parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWrz29"&gt;Of course, proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new, and while today’s MagSafe licensing feels slow, it’s better than things used to be. The original iteration of MagSafe on laptops wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/185781/magsafe.html"&gt;licensed out to third party companies&lt;/a&gt; at all: if you wanted a spare charger or to charge your Mac from an external battery pack, you were pretty much out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAlVX5"&gt;The most famous example of this is accessory maker Sanho, which famously bought $79 MagSafe chargers, disassembled them, and used the original cable to allow Mac owners to charge their computers with its &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/202098/hypermacbatteries.html"&gt;HyperMac batteries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/09/apples-magsafe-lawsuit-tests-limits-of-first-sale-doctrine/"&gt;Apple then sued Sanho&lt;/a&gt;, which was forced to come up with a workaround that instructed customers to buy their own chargers and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/hypermac-sidesteps-apple-patent-headache-with-diy-solutions/?comments=1"&gt;modify the cables themselves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH87fY"&gt;But a year out, it’s hard to feel like MagSafe isn’t a missed opportunity for Apple. When the iPhone 12 first came out, MagSafe looked like a way for the company to build an ecosystem of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;snap-on modular accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the sort of thing that Motorola had tried and failed to accomplish with its Moto Mods system. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;visions of port-less iPhones&lt;/a&gt; that could rely on MagSafe exclusively for charging and connecting to external devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnO5e8"&gt;But instead of that thriving new accessory ecosystem, Apple has effectively left us with a handful of Apple-designed cables. It makes Apple’s magnetic standard look less like a stepping stone to the portless future, and more like another brick in Apple’s walled garden. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At Virtual Realms: Videogames Transformed, game designers tackle a new realm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rQorJN"&gt;When you build a procedural tree of life, there are going to be branches. This was a learning process for the Irish artist David OReilly, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5857458/mountain-game"&gt;existential simulation games&lt;/a&gt; started making their way into galleries around the world. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;, which was long-listed for an Academy Award, was launched in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The game allows players to control, bond, and shift between objects at various scales, from subatomic particles to land animals and planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc1pfC"&gt;“To make &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;, it involved making this incredibly detailed library of objects,” OReilly says. “And so all the interaction was done by having a really big catalog of things, along with information about their relationship with other objects: their color variation, their size, their sound effects, how they move, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MpevV"&gt;This came in handy when OReilly was asked to translate his virtual worlds into physical art installations. &lt;a href="http://www.davidoreilly.com/eye-of-the-dream"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an adaptation of this remarkable library of metadata, an audio-reactive Kaleidoscopic film for 360 domes and planetaria. OReilly calls it an &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; branch because of how it grew out of the game’s development repository. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Kj7h"&gt;Initially, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt; was engineered to be more interactive, with the simulation parameters controlled by a website on participant’s smartphones. “But once it was put in practice, it was total chaos,” OReilly says. “You have this very harmonious simulation experience with all of this beautiful music, but when you have 100 people with controllers on their phones in the darkness, you get a lot of people going back and forth from zero to 100 over and over again to figure out what their level of control is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54dvWp"&gt;As a result, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt; toured Europe and America as a recording of this algorithm, a “&lt;a href="http://www.davidoreilly.com/eye-of-the-dream"&gt;ballet choreographed by math&lt;/a&gt;” to which observers could surrender. The interactive infrastructure was left behind, but it wasn’t long before another branch sprouted from the &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; tree. &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt;, a collaboration between OReilly and media designers onedotzero, is currently on display at Singapore’s ArtScience Museum as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions/virtual-realms.html"&gt;Virtual Realms: Videogames Transformed&lt;/a&gt; exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PclDlh"&gt;Virtual Realms is a bold opportunity for video game developers to transpose their virtual worlds into physical space, confronting new challenges and exploring the medium’s boundaries. As well as gazing into OReilly’s &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt;, attendees will be able to experience installations from Kojima Productions (&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;), Enhance (&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;), thatgamecompany (&lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;), Media Molecule (&lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;), and Tequila Works (&lt;em&gt;Rime&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3B1vcW"&gt;Instead of 100 people fighting the algorithm from their phone screens, OReilly’s &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt; offers three oversized discs that participants can spin to scale and warp a mandala of assets like flowers, shells, and cars. Music from the London Symphony Orchestra reacts to the simulation, with non-interactive participants lounging on spongey seats, basking in its infinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdO9Od"&gt;OReilly has long been inspired by the abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who synchronized films to jazz and classical music in the early 20th century. “This is very much taking the game engine and the codebase but interacting with it more like you’d interact with a musical instrument,” OReilly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZZYt8h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The game is spinning out from the digital world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YFX4Bw"&gt;Virtual Realms was curated by Enhance’s Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who OReilly calls “the master of audiovisual interactive experiences.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"&gt;Mizuguchi has pushed the medium forward throughout his career by attempting to summon feelings of synesthesia in players&lt;/a&gt;. In his 2001 rail shooter &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt;, Mizuguchi managed this by combining abstract visuals, eclectic dance music, and strong haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57pjhE"&gt;Mizuguchi’s pedigree meant that reaching out to potential collaborators was an easy process. Working with London performing arts center The Barbican, he made a list of designers and artists with ambitions beyond the broad strokes of video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXCb4T"&gt;The response was immediate; as soon as they heard the concept, developers were attracted to the unique challenge of turning their virtual visions into something that people could experience in meatspace. “The game is spinning out from the digital world,” Mizuguchi says. “This is a very deep architecture, one that is unlimited, and we are growing as technology evolves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="awfMrD"&gt;Enhance’s contribution to Virtual Realms is a collaboration with media artists Rhizomatiks called &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt;, which Mizuguchi describes as “an experiment to crystallize the game mechanism of &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt; into a real spatial experience.” Four participants enter a dark room and wield haptic spheres. When they move around the space and interact with others, music and visuals react in real time, building a unique synesthetic performance. “It’s the same mechanism as a game, but with much more freedom,” Mizuguchi says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSc055"&gt;For Enhance, it was about stimulating as many senses as possible. “We are trying to make a new kind of emotional chemistry that is not only emotional but emotional and physical,” Mizuguchi says. “It’s a new kind of storytelling, a synesthetic experiential narrative … where the visuals and sound become borderless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiZlAO"&gt;Ayahiko Sato of Rhizomatiks said that it took countless adjustments to get the audio and visuals in tune with each other to create “sounds which can be seen and visuals that can be heard and felt.” Mizuguchi hopes that &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; will move people in a way that they can’t explain, inviting them into the world of video games by showing them what the medium is truly capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6u5nH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are trying to make a new kind of emotional chemistry.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qUjVZ"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; is about a 90-minute to three-hour experience in general, or maybe five or six hours if you want to unlock everything,” OReilly says. But when designing physical adaptations, the conventional rules of video games have to change. “In a gallery, you don’t know when people will enter and leave, so you adapt the systems for that and unlock more things, as there’s no start or endpoint. You let go of control,” OReilly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNJAWB"&gt;Anyone who visits Virtual Realms during its proposed world tour will experience their own version of &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; due to how the installations have been designed. “I think that ephemeral quality makes each moment unique to what you’re able to see of it,” OReilly says. “It’s not something you can do with other forms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYXJdJ"&gt;Without the comfort of conventional controllers, installations present a challenge for exhibitors, but the breathing room and immersion that physical space provides can be liberating. “I had spent, you know, the better part of 15 years, releasing everything online, with things being part of people’s internet experience,” OReilly says. “But I felt like that hit a certain limit, a saturation point, where there’s just too many things going on, and it’s very difficult to create this kind of experience I want when it might be one tab away from social media or the news or whatever, so I really love the idea of doing it in a physical space.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="w7tOF9"&gt;“I completely took the entire roof off, but if it had rained, my house would be ruined.” John Beech is tilting his webcam to show me the makeshift ceiling above his head. A former construction worker turned lead designer at Media Molecule, his past experience was a boon when developing the studio’s Virtual Realms installation, &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAjRFr"&gt;“The knowledge of what I knew as a builder actually really helped, especially with the early development of &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; when we hooked up with Marshmallow Laser Feast, who are very much in that physical realm,” Beech explains. “I could be that bridge between them and the artists and audio people from Media Molecule, both with my sense of physicality and my experience making stuff in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnNbHL"&gt;Marshmallow Laser Feast is an experimental design collective based in London known for crafting exhibits that blend cutting-edge technology with physical space. Accordingly, &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a dark room and has participants donning helmets and waving giant soft play shapes in front of an interactive screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0gcSLa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nothing was right, and nothing was wrong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8QA3c"&gt;Robin McNicholas of Marshmallow Laser Feast called it “exploding the game controller and distributing it in space.” The combined vision for &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; was one of regression. Beech says Media Molecule wanted to break down the structural barriers that form with age and inhibit the childlike wonder of play. “You would go into a soft play amusement area, and nothing was right, and nothing was wrong,” Beech says. “You picked up some shapes; you fiddled around here; there was no sort of structure to it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJWWwI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; props are embedded with trackers which interface with a virtual environment that Media Molecule built entirely in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, the studio’s latest commercial release, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21136244/dreams-ps4-game-creation-tool-exposure-problem-curation-media-molecule"&gt;PlayStation-based game creation engine&lt;/a&gt;. “It really does just run off a PS4; there isn’t any sort of cheating in that sense,” Beech says. All of the development took place using DualShock 4s and PlayStation Move controllers. The only external tweak was allowing &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; to interpret the tracking coordinates on the soft play props, but even then, the data was fed to an in-game gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWcDh"&gt;The development of &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; raises an interesting discussion about the democratization of interactive art. Beech says that &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; users and indie game developers could easily make their own art installations out of the box, pointing to how others have interpreted the engine for their own means. “One of our audio coders, Bogdan [Vera], he took &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihF5WQdtyaM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; to something called Algorave&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a cool generative rave synth party scene,” Beech says. “And he did it with the music tools in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rel753"&gt;Media Molecule’s intake of motion capture data for &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; is something that isn’t possible in the public version of &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, but Beech says the studio is always looking for ways to expand the engine’s digital toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFjssN"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not a finished project,” Beech says. “We will keep adding cool features that will hopefully facilitate ways to use &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; in more and more ways that people don’t expect … we’re hoping people won’t have to necessarily hack it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="x3PFoK"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic also caused serious problems for the Virtual Realms exhibit. Mizuguchi mentioned that after initial meetings in Tokyo to discuss the idea, he couldn’t regroup with local collaborators like Hideo Kojima due to the impact of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZ48to"&gt;Testing ambitious installations in quarantine also demanded creative solutions. Enhance and Rhizomatiks simulated the &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; installation space in virtual reality, all the way down to the position of its many speakers. The two teams used Oculus Quest 2 headsets to walk through the virtual venue and fine-tune audio spatiality and visuals, though they naturally had to compromise when it came to testing high-end haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGA2um"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m excited to have something that will bring people physically together.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KawWny"&gt;Media Molecule’s work on &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; started before the pandemic, but the project faced its own challenges due to remote collaboration. “We were doing it pre-COVID, but it may as well have been because we were in two separate offices,” says Media Molecule’s John Beech. “Marshmallow Laser Feast ran around with the shapes doing random stuff, but not knowing what they were interacting with, and they sent back that recorded data which we could then play as like a replay that informed &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; what to do,” Beech explains. “So you would see if it was technically working, but you wouldn’t be able to see if, in the game scenario, people would respond to the interaction,” Beech added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6wmNN"&gt;Unable to attend in person, many developers will have to wait for restrictions to lift or until the exhibition tours their part of the world. Meanwhile, they just have to trust that visitors, game-savvy or not, will respond to their unique installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEwKBS"&gt;OReilly’s former work in glitch art has steeled him for any potential errors. “In general, with my work, you acknowledge that it has a digital origin, so you know parts of these errors are part of the experience. But at the same time, you want the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; errors; you want the right kind of accidents,” OReilly says. “We go and see musicians live because on some level, there’s a potential that an accident will happen and that it won’t be exactly like the album you’ve been listening to, and it’s the same here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otX3Xb"&gt;As the world starts to tentatively open up, social experiences like Virtual Realms provide a way for people to reconnect after spending so much time in lockdown, which can be profound for creators, too. “A lot of this comes out of concentrated periods of time between me and the computer,” OReilly says. “And even though this project was set back by all of this, I’m excited to have something that will bring people physically together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RLQpeG"&gt;“This is a young medium that’s totally undeniable and an absolutely natural evolution of all artistic forms that have come before it,” said OReilly. “And it can produce emotional effects that nothing else can do. I don’t particularly care how the intellectuals parse these things, but I know that people will come away from [Virtual Realms] with a feeling that they’ve never had from any other kind of art form before, and that’s its power. “&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn off unwanted ‘memories’ in Apple Photos, Google Photos, and Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gsmAx8Ipp_Y86f-eylq2xg2n1o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742560/akrales_191007_3710_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbCiHm"&gt;The memory machines that Apple, Facebook, and Google have built to remind us of our favorite moments can, like any algorithmic creation, serve up subpar output. Instead of evoking recollections of those times we felt like we were living our best lives, they can invoke the low points of our existence — a miserable job, a rotten commute, a bad breakup, or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7iGuo"&gt;Apple Photos, Facebook, and Google Photos provide tools to manage what their “memories” features can push out to you. But these settings to control what pictures and posts get algorithmically bubbled up to your screen aren’t always easy to find — even, in some situations, after these apps have presented a gut-punch of a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdElfi"&gt;Here’s how to control, at least in part, what memories you will see in each of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9nb5kG"&gt;Apple Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="smUYpj"&gt;If you’re using iOS 14, Apple’s implementation of its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207023"&gt;Memories feature&lt;/a&gt; provides less control compared to those offered by the other two companies here. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;once you move to iOS 15 later this year&lt;/a&gt;, that should change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oYB2YS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 14 device:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THgyn0"&gt;If Photos presents you with a memory you’d rather avoid, long-press the video or photo and then tap on the “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” button below the photo… and hope for the best, as iOS 14 does not provide options to exclude certain people or dates from its Memories feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjTPK9"&gt;You can also go to the “For You” section of Photos (found at the bottom of your screen), find the photo or video you want to avoid, and long-press it to get the same menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uC9kvj"&gt;To stop Photos from notifying you of new Memories, open the Settings app, select “Notifications” &amp;gt; “Photos” &amp;gt; “Memories” and toggle off “Allow Notifications.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6Nv1wW"&gt;If you’ve added the Photos widget to your iPhone’s homescreen, pictures from your Featured Photos memory collection can also show up there. To remove one from that list, tap and hold it until a menu appears, then scroll down and tap on “Remove from Featured Photos.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DP18bP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 15 device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBNBRm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; operating system adds an option to feature a particular person less often in Memories, or delete that person entirely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OWywTa"&gt;In the Photos app, tap on the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen, and then tap on People (under “People &amp;amp; Places”). Select the person whose Memories you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spWHT5"&gt;Tap on the three dots at the top right. You’ll get a pop-up menu that lets you, among other things, feature that person less or remove them from the “People” list entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rLADi6"&gt;If you tap on “Feature This Person Less,” you’ll get two choices: to feature that person less in Memories or never feature them at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ciZr9H"&gt;If you tap on “Remove This Person from People,” you’ll be invited to reset the people album, which will clear it of all names and favorites from all your iCloud-connected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iOS 15 will offer more say over your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WodsTmSXw1SSvm6I7SFfdY-C6pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788062/IMG_A114459CB882_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 will offer more say over your Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can feature a person less, or never feature them again." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbtFj1USRmXeghawzrtXWEAnNnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788065/IMG_53D5B76DA8FF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can feature a person less or never feature them again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3F0tcN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Mac &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="McA7an"&gt;Right-click on the photo and select “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” to get fewer such reminders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICByer"&gt;To stop the operating system from notifying you of new Memories, go to the Photos menu at the top left-hand corner of the screen, select “Preferences…” and under the “General” tab, uncheck the box next to “Show Memories Notification.” You can also uncheck “Show Holiday Events” if holiday photos are a special irritation for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4FK3lw6I7Pr_XmWBZUFXceuiAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788111/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_2.16.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjsxcc"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e9jrsn"&gt;The social network took a few months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8284703/facebook-on-this-day-nostalgia-recap"&gt;launching its nostalgia inducer as “On This Day” in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to add the ability to filter out people or dates. The tool has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16202094/facebook-on-this-day-update-seasonal-monthly-recap-memories"&gt;built out since then&lt;/a&gt; and is now called Memories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krRmIt"&gt;You can use either the web app or the mobile app to change your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Hsehnl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wIJEta"&gt;Select “Memories” in the left-hand column (you may have to click on “See More” to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAcQfV"&gt;Click on “Hide People” or “Hide Dates” on the left. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook’s web app lets you hide specific people from your Memories notifications." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjarnbLCgYWcgWx7ST8ZysiQYxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788159/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_2.42.55_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s web app lets you hide specific people from your Memories notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Pfzkiy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mobile app &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RVP2Yr"&gt;Tap the menu icon at the top right (Android) or bottom right (iOS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UVmN8y"&gt;Tap “Memories” and then the gear icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cNFkDq"&gt;Look under “Hide Memories” and select “People” or “Dates.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Memories in the menu after tapping the three parallel lines." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMJ1SV39_9rOWs9kTo5_cCuGTdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788185/Screenshot_20210817_144705.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Memories in the menu after tapping the three parallel lines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Besides hiding people or dates, you can choose how often to be notified about Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8C8A27tTKSNT3SV2B7BWeaA3Nc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788187/Screenshot_20210817_144739.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides hiding people or dates, you can choose how often to be notified about Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="762bAN"&gt;Whether you’re on a mobile device or a desktop, you can now type in the names of any people you don’t want in your Memories, or any dates you want to exclude. Note when you type in a name, you may sometimes get public pages or profiles of random strangers before you get the names of friends — at least, that was my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrGLNs"&gt;One item you can’t exclude from Memories: posts from other people who tagged you in them. (Consider this paragraph a feature request, Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4nPVW"&gt;The Memories settings screens also let you regulate how often Facebook notifies you of new Memories: a maximum of once a day, algorithmically chosen highlights, or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orhdTM"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1m6c"&gt;The Memories feature Google added to Google Photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20860938/google-photos-memories-prints-cvs-walmart-canvas"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; also offers options to hide people (and pets) or dates from your notifications of past events that bubble up in its mobile apps. The Photos web app doesn’t offer those settings because it doesn’t push notifications to your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g51Klu"&gt;On the mobile Google Photos app, tap the account-profile picture at the top right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="07qt64"&gt;Tap “Photos settings” (in Android) or “Google Photos Settings” (on Apple devices). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7fSqQk"&gt;Tap “Memories.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E08zPw"&gt;Tap “Hide people &amp;amp; pets” to remove one from these flashbacks. This will be easier if you’ve already added names to the faces that Google Photos automatically recognizes and classifies. And if Google Photos misses a picture of somebody — say, if it was taken at a strange angle or in poor light — it can still resurface in Memories. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oI8skK"&gt;The “Hide dates” tool (also on the “Memories” page) is far simpler. Tap “Hide Dates,” and select the day or days you want gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aRqYt5"&gt;To have Google Photos stop notifying you about some or all Memories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hk1L0h"&gt;Tap the “Notifications” link on the Memories page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vcwueM"&gt;On the next page, look for the “Memories” section. Here, you can opt out of having Google Photos nudge you about on-this-day memories from previous years or “Themed memories” (like the “They grow up so fast” compilations of pictures of my daughter that it somehow knows to push when a work trip has me away from my family).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos’ Memories page lets you hide people, pets, or dates." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t3uUtWqFg22cjzULDTdKIXCEKm0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788245/Screenshot_20210817_145034.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos’ Memories page lets you hide people, pets, or dates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also choose when you want to see Memories notifications." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-TaLjakXtzKwhu-_tlRHZrCdYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788247/Screenshot_20210817_145228.png"&gt;

    <title>Waymo is building a hub for its autonomous trucks in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuxP7ZjFLiEF8dqiiqJ83Elp98o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742176/vpavic_191202_3827_0042.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3nXuIa"&gt;Waymo announced plans to build a hub for its autonomous semi-trailer trucks on a nine-acre site near Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. The Alphabet-owned company also said it is partnering with rental truck company Ryder on fleet management as it looks to grow the delivery and logistics portion of its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Pgsjd"&gt;The hub in South Dallas will be Waymo’s “primary operations center” in the state for its fleet of autonomous trucks. The hub will be built to accommodate “hundreds of trucks and personnel” as the company gets closer to launching a full-scale freight-hauling operation using its fully autonomous vehicles — though Waymo has yet to say exactly when that will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wjcnqg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“primary operations center”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ljza"&gt;Currently, Waymo is testing the fifth generation of its “Driver,” which is the term used to describe its combination of hardware, sensors, and AI software, on its fleet of Class 8 trucks. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527430/waymo-jb-hunt-autonomous-truck-freight-test-texas"&gt;working with JB Hunt Transport Services&lt;/a&gt; to haul freight along several interstates in Texas. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;Waymo is continuing its work with Daimler&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, on a fully autonomous, Level 4 system for trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJ_rU_F0unAiNBvFPmnAiEKiCs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787793/Waymo_Via_facility.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syWFP0"&gt;While much of the public’s focus has been on Waymo’s autonomous minivans that operate in Arizona as part of a limited ride-hailing service, less attention has been paid to the company’s stated plans to eventually launch a commercial freight hauling business. Waymo has a modest fleet of Peterbilt trucks that have been retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors and software, and it is currently testing them in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078438/waymo-self-driving-minivans-trucks-texas-new-mexico"&gt;Arizona, California, and Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79DABw"&gt;The trucks operate autonomously during tests and commercial deliveries but include two Waymo employees, a commercially licensed driver, and a software engineer, who sit in the cab and monitor the driving. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9FGOGT_fYnw5XEkPbnWh1M84SM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787794/Ryder_Waymo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7uskpr"&gt;Waymo also said it would be teaming up with Ryder, one of the nation’s largest rental truck operators, for help with fleet management services. This will include fleet maintenance, inspections, and roadside assistance — though both companies see opportunities for future services. Waymo has similar deals for its robotaxi fleet in Arizona and California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17762326/waymo-self-driving-ride-hail-fleet-management"&gt;with Avis and AutoNation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wKBFU"&gt;Waymo has been working on autonomous trucks since 2017 and plans to eventually launch a full-scale freight hauling and delivery service called Waymo Via. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; detailed many of the company’s struggles to grow beyond the experimental phase into a commercially viable business. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve Minutes is a strange interactive thriller that’s better with friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTZNe0riZ1sNuV9hzW0BzWTDJQ0=/60x0:1860x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742105/TwelveMinutes_Screenshot_03__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e2sjbN"&gt;I’m not sure I could’ve solved the intricate mystery of &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; on my own. The interactive thriller — which boasts a star-studded cast including James McAvoy, Daisy Ridley, and Willem Dafoe — forces players to relive the same short span of time repeatedly. Over that time you’ll die repeatedly at the hands of Dafoe, but during each loop you’ll also pick up some tiny new breadcrumb of information to help explain what’s happening. It can be frustrating, with fiddly controls and an ending that goes completely off the rails. But as a group experience, it’s a lot of fun; even though it’s technically a single-player game, I found myself sharing ideas and theories with my partner, and it was helpful having an extra pair of eyes to spot clues I might’ve missed. &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can be tedious and repetitive — but like most games, it’s much better with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlhrtc"&gt;The game starts out simple enough. &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; opens with an unnamed man, played by McAvoy, arriving at his apartment in the early evening. He’s greeted by his wife, voiced by Ridley, who has a special night planned. She’s made his favorite dessert and is going to break some big news while they eat. The romantic evening is quickly interrupted by a man claiming to be a cop (Dafoe) breaking in and arresting the woman for murdering her father. He then demands to see a pocket watch, and when the wife refuses, the cop starts to choke her husband to death. Upon dying, McAvoy’s character returns to his front door, 12 minutes earlier, as if nothing happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="22W8OJ"&gt;As the title implies, that brief loop is the core of &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes. &lt;/em&gt;The entirety of the game takes place during that window of time and inside of the couple’s small apartment. If you try to leave through the front door, it resets. If the cop kills you — which he will, repeatedly, with his bare hands and with weapons — it restarts. You can’t change that, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use that time to search for information. And you do this by experimenting, using the limited options at your disposal to find ways to live those 12 minutes differently. At times, &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can almost feel like a really ominous toy, where you’re constantly changing the variables to see what happens, often with grisly results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="kLcFeQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10707224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3upOpN"&gt;You view the world from an overhead perspective, and the game plays out a bit like an old-school point-and-click adventure. You have the ability to talk to people, pick up certain objects, and interact with a few parts of the apartment. The world is small — there’s just a living room, bathroom, bedroom, and a tiny closet — and you’re relatively limited in terms of what you can do. You can’t, for instance, search through every object in a dresser drawer or dig through the fridge. But those things you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; interact with are usually important and can be combined in different, usually intuitive ways. If you pick up a mug, for instance, you can drag it over to the sink to fill it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIoEPE"&gt;As you play and learn more, your options start to open up. Initially, I had no idea what to do. I tried explaining to the wife that I was in a time loop, but of course she didn’t understand. The small space and limited options felt restrictive. But then I started to experiment. I decided to see what would happen if she got mad, or if she fell asleep, or if I used that big knife as a weapon. Usually I just died, but sometimes I would find something interesting — a hidden item or a phone number — that I knew could be used during the next loop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Je2LEQ"&gt;The problem is this structure means a lot of repetition. It’s not so bad early on, when everything still feels new, but the further you progress the more the repetition sets in. You’ll hear the same lines of dialogue many times, and often play through near-identical scenarios. Toward the end, as the complexity ratcheted up, I found myself writing a to-do list of everything that needed to happen in the next loop, lest I forget something. It’s really annoying to end up with Willem Dafoe’s hands around your neck because you forgot to lock the door. On consoles these issues are exacerbated by the controls. I played the game on the Xbox Series X, but the interface is clearly designed for a mouse, as you have to drag a cursor around the screen to do just about everything. With a gamepad it’s slow, which is extra frustrating in a game where time is constantly working against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7OUev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can be fiddly at times, but it does nail that incredible feeling of slowly unraveling a mystery. Each new breadcrumb is a victory. The game rarely gives you overt clues or hints, so that sense of accomplishment is only more pronounced. This is also what makes it a good game to have someone watch along with you; missing even the tiniest detail can mean getting stuck. And since the game is essentially about experimenting with each loop, it’s a lot of fun to toss around wild ideas with someone else, in hopes of finding a new route. Unfortunately, while the world and story initially feel very grounded — aside from all the time travel — things get a bit too outlandish toward the end. I’ve been thinking about it for two days, and the game’s ending still doesn’t make much sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfknXq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; tries to do something very specific, and in many ways it succeeds. There are few games where solving a mystery feels so playful and organic, and the game does a great job at creating tension. My heart always started racing when I heard the elevator open in the hallway, knowing the cop was about to barge in. But those good parts are muddied by the often tedious structure and an ending that is more unbelievable than shocking. Your enjoyment will depend mostly on your tolerance for repetition — and if you have any mystery-loving friends to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9YshP"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Twelve Minutes &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches August 19th on Xbox and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
