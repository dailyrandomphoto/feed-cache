    <title>PlayStation Network was down globally for over an hour</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="alN1yQ"&gt;If you were having issues with the PlayStation Network (PSN) this evening or afternoon, you weren’t alone. The service suffered an outage, with multiplayer, store services, and more going down for around an hour. The outage appeared to be global — the official Ask PlayStation Japan Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPS_JP/status/1387165181709627394"&gt;reported the issue&lt;/a&gt;, and we saw many users from Europe also reporting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evjd8R"&gt;It seems like it’s resolved now, with the &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;PSN status page&lt;/a&gt; showing that everything is up and running. I’ve also confirmed that I’ve been able to download a game from the PlayStation Store, and hop into a multiplayer match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PSN status page at 6:55PM ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3F9Krh"&gt;The outage affected all the categories listed on the PSN’s status page — account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and PlayStation Direct — all were marked as being down for about an hour (though reports of the outage started rolling in around 20 minutes before the status page lights started turning red).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBuKsy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Players may experience an issue logging in through the PlayStation Network. We'll post an update when this is resolved. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QPt8nuvwy2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QPt8nuvwy2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1387157311421140994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8zaYDQ"&gt;During the outage, multiple&lt;em&gt; Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers had difficulties downloading items from the store, playing multiplayer games, checking leaderboards, and loading the PlayStation app on their phones. Reports &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; peaked around 44,000, after they started to flow in at about 5PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DruH1s"&gt;Sony didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sailor Moon’s newest movie is hitting Netflix on June 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDoMRS7Et5rjq4Nfp37-0GKhozI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69196012/SME2020MVzenki.02412720200721_6814_1i5ylsp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie &lt;/em&gt;Part 1 and Part 2. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBpvgY"&gt;The newest movie in the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; franchise, &lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie &lt;/em&gt;(which was originally released in two parts), is hitting Netflix on June 3. The movie’s arrival on Netflix marks its premiere for the first time outside of Japan, where Part 1 debuted in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exqKNw"&gt;You can watch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_D2statICww"&gt;a teaser trailer for it here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rDuS3n"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D2statICww?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nVDyIe"&gt;Here’s Netflix’s synopsis of the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0YaJpj"&gt;The upcoming adventures are set in April, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom and Tokyo is in a festive mood as it celebrates the largest &lt;em&gt;Total Solar Eclipse&lt;/em&gt; of the century. As the new moon obscures the sun and gradually dims its light, Usagi and Chibi-Usa encounter &lt;em&gt;Pegasus&lt;/em&gt;, who is in search of the chosen &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; who can break the seal of the Golden Crystal. Meanwhile, a mysterious troupe called the &lt;em&gt;Dead Moon Circus&lt;/em&gt; appears in town who’s nefarious plan is to scatter the nightmare incarnations known as Lemures, seize the &lt;em&gt;‘Legendary Silver Crystal,’&lt;/em&gt; rule over the moon and the earth, and eventually dominate the entire universe…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1T1znX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal &lt;/em&gt;is Netflix’s latest addition to its ever-growing anime slate. Anime is quickly becoming a key focus for Netflix — the company committed to launching 40 anime titles in 2021 alone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353848/netflix-launch-anime-ragnarok-zeus-resident-evil-streaming"&gt;just last month&lt;/a&gt;, as animation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349203/doj-crunchyroll-investigation-sony-att"&gt;becomes a front in the ongoing streaming wars&lt;/a&gt;. That lineup includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22373405/yasuke-netflix-flying-lotus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show about a Black samurai in feudal Japan that premieres on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ovZNx"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; movie joins Netflix’s already jam-packed summer movie lineup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404701/netflix-summer-movie-preview-2021"&gt;which I wrote about earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899 ($100 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; B&amp;amp;H Photo has &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604827-REG%2Fapple_mgn93ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price-matched&lt;/a&gt; Amazon, but only the silver and gold models are discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,170&lt;/a&gt; ($79 off) or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($69 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but it’s on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604811-REG%2Fapple_myda2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it currently for its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738979441805036476#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams usage jumps to 145 million daily active users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgEyJvpdH-oMM3vjFh1FmSm9O8=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195378/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0tcfT"&gt;Microsoft now has 145 million people using its Microsoft Teams communications app. This is another increase of 26 percent since Microsoft revealed Teams usage had jumped during the pandemic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million daily active users in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Usage of Teams has spiked over the past year, with businesses continuing to flock to services like Teams, Slack, and Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNJcT1"&gt;To put the 145 million figure in perspective, at the beginning of the pandemic, Microsoft had around 32 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241972/microsoft-teams-75-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;jumped to 75 million&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of weeks, and these numbers have more than doubled since even the early days of the pandemic. It’s an impressive amount of growth, just as Microsoft has been aggressively pushing businesses to move to the cloud and adopt Teams over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAKx51"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftTeams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftTeams&lt;/a&gt; now 145 million daily active users    - thank you to customers, partners, and team&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Teper (@jeffteper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffteper/status/1387141320519557120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="lsm0ak"&gt;As always, it’s difficult to compare to rival services. Google and Zoom don’t reveal daily active users and opt for a more vague daily active participants. This means a single user could be counted multiple times if they participate in different meetings during a day. Zoom revealed it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement"&gt;300 million daily active participants&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Google said last year it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240434/google-meet-three-million-users-per-day-pichai-earnings"&gt;100 million daily active participants&lt;/a&gt;. Slack revealed it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195092/slack-new-user-records-coronavirus-pandemic-remote-working-growth-concurrent-users"&gt;12.5 million concurrent users&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of the pandemic last year, but the company has shied away from daily active user counts ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiD8KK"&gt;Microsoft’s explosive Teams growth might explain why the service has experienced troubles this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405300/microsoft-teams-down-outage-worldwide-issues"&gt;Teams went down worldwide&lt;/a&gt; for many users for two hours this morning, after a similar outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362975/microsoft-teams-xbox-live-down-outage-issue"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; and connectivity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;issues last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting live hockey, thanks to a new NHL deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Toronto Maple Leafs v Winnipeg Jets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JG14zzwjy9W1dS0EsL13sKLd0w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195374/1232510519.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Kozub/NHLI via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsHUzz"&gt;Live hockey is coming to HBO Max, thanks to a new seven-year deal between the National Hockey League and WarnerMedia’s Turner Sports. The news may come as a bit of a surprise,  as, only a few weeks ago, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/hbo-max-warnermedia-streaming-jason-kilar-1234713108/"&gt;sports would not appear&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVCGR1"&gt;Alongside HBO Max stepping into the sports streaming spotlight, Turner Sports also announced that TNT and TBS will air the Stanley Cup three out of the seven years outlined in the deal. (Specifically, WarnerMedia’s channels will air the championship series in 2023, 2025, and 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-turner-sports-reach-tv-deal-for-games-on-tnt-tbs/c-324075352"&gt;according to the NHL&lt;/a&gt;.) The remaining years will be hosted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323789/disney-nhl-deal-espn-plus-stream-abc-hockey-sports"&gt;Disney’s ESPN Plus and ABC&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the sports league’s other major streaming deal, now that its contract with NBC is ending this year. WarnerMedia’s various properties will also be able to broadcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sbGKkQ"&gt;Half of the conference finals and half of the first two rounds of playoffs each season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKHzPg"&gt;72 regular-season games per season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jFK5Mq"&gt;The NHL Winter Classic each season (exclusively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WrRzOX"&gt;For any diehard cord-cutting NHL fan, this creates a tricky scenario. To make sure you’re able to watch the Stanley Cup for the next seven years, you’ll have to either alternate between HBO Max and ESPN Plus or use the NHL’s own streaming service, NHL.TV, if you live somewhere one of the other services isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2voS"&gt;ESPN Plus currently costs $5.99 per month, or $13.99 per month bundled with Disney Plus and Hulu. HBO Max costs $14.99 per month. NHL.TV costs $34.99 for an “All-Access Pass” to the 2021–2022 season or $29.74 for one specific team’s games. (The NHL says some games won’t be on NHL.TV if they’re available on local over-the-air TV.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYMhSS"&gt;Bringing live hockey to HBO Max is notable because the brand really isn’t known for live sports. Outside of airing some tennis and boxing, HBO’s biggest investment in sports media has come in the form of documentaries and series, including the Peabody Award-winning &lt;em&gt;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Px5NG3"&gt;While it may confuse the already-confusing HBO Max content library, having some kind of live sports programming increasingly seems to be table stakes for any streaming service that wants people to stay subscribed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; does it, Disney does it on &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/espn-plus-launches-hulu-1234927368/"&gt;Hulu and ESPN Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/paramount-plus-stinks-heres-why-im-subscribing-anyway#:~:text=Paramount%20Plus%20streams%20other%20live,streams%20and%20golf%20as%20well."&gt;ViacomCBS’ Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; also has a solid sports offering. If anything, WarnerMedia is doing the expected — which, for any hockey fan who’s already subscribed to HBO Max, should be a nice addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhW58P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijad6G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon confirms there are problems with phone calls in Southern California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5uYohPrrW1XYNybYSJ5xRXQML0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195325/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California are reporting difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company has confirmed to The Verge that there is a “network issue” affecting parts of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm9D8h"&gt;“We are experiencing a network issue impacting voice services for some customers in parts of Southern California,” a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our engineers have identified the issue and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4u39G"&gt;If you are having trouble making calls, the spokesperson recommended putting your device in airplane mode or restarting your phone, which they said should fix the issues. And in response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon’s support account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx0gQT"&gt;I’ve found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlisleshelley/status/1387139550410010627"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeGoff20/status/1387140510335205377"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RickyJimenez/status/1387140515435466752"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tscarrithers/status/1387140551258951681"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; making phone calls in Southern California, but it’s not clear exactly how far the outage extends or exactly which areas might be affected. Downdetector’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;map of user reports&lt;/a&gt; strongly indicates that the outage is affecting Los Angeles, San Diego, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyZS7tN_0NfpXa4gKbvJbGVRV_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22474098/Screen_Shot_2021_04_27_at_2.09.59_PM.png"&gt;

Reports on Downdetector have since fallen, but I’m still seeing reports of issues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TuurtleLover/status/1387164305431285760"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/that7x7/status/1387161888543240192"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is okay with Joe Rogan telling 21-year-olds not to get vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcfLO3Af2fkLqrV4vQrUspVU4n8=/220x0:1708x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195283/Screen_Shot_2020_05_21_at_10.07.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joe Rogan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWQ6Fz"&gt;In a recent episode of &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, the world’s most popular podcaster suggests that healthy young people don’t need the COVID-19 vaccine, contrary to the advice of health professionals trying to stem a pandemic that’s killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/world/covid-deaths-3-million.html"&gt;more than 3 million people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azdHSN"&gt;Rogan said he believes “for the most part it’s safe to get vaccinated” and that his parents are vaccinated. But then he adds: “But if you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go no.” The remarks were highlighted by &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/spotifys-joe-rogan-encourages-healthy-21-year-olds-not-get-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a transcript of Rogan’s April 23rd conversation with fellow comedian Dave Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDDv6h"&gt;A source close to the situation says Spotify reviewed this Rogan episode and left it live because he doesn’t come off as outwardly anti-vaccine. He also doesn’t make a call to action, this source says, noting that the company has taken down other, explicitly anti-vaccine podcasts and music. One show that was pulled said vaccines kill, they say, while another said vaccines cause skin conditions. Musician Ian Brown &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ian-brown-says-spotify-have-taken-down-his-anti-lockdown-song-little-seed-big-tree-2899613"&gt;also had a song taken down&lt;/a&gt; in March in which he said the vaccines inserted microchips into people. In January, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/pete-evans-spotify-ban-2021-1"&gt;removed Pete Evans’ podcast&lt;/a&gt; over COVID-19 misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPy1Pc"&gt;At the time, Spotify issued a statement saying: “Spotify prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health. When content that violates this standard is identified it is removed from the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PJJN4"&gt;The company declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxgRRU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A source close to the situation says Rogan didn’t make a direct call to action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Bt0XT"&gt;Spotify brought &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; exclusively to its platform last year, and since then, he’s courted multiple controversies, particularly around &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-09-16/caitlyn-jenner-joe-rogan-kardashians"&gt;remarks that have been criticized as transphobic&lt;/a&gt;. Episodes of the show have &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/spotify-deletes-joe-rogan-podcast-episodes/"&gt;mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt;, and Spotify employees have &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8jq4/spotify-joe-rogan-transphobic"&gt;voiced their dissatisfaction&lt;/a&gt; at their employer paying Rogan and keeping his show live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNkNfe"&gt;His recent recommendations on vaccines aren’t based in science. While older people are at a higher risk of contracting the most severe forms of the disease, healthy 21-year-olds can and do get COVID-19. Some might suffer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/18/health/long-term-effects-young-people-covid-wellness/index.html"&gt;long-term chronic symptoms&lt;/a&gt; after contracting the disease. And as more older people get vaccinated in the US, researchers have noticed that the demographics of the disease are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/04/young-kids-vaccines-covid/618650/"&gt;starting to shift&lt;/a&gt;. In Michigan, which is currently a COVID-19 hotspot, hospitals are seeing more young people coming in with severe symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaPtqA"&gt;“I am putting more patients in their 20s and 30s and 40s on oxygen and on life support than at any other time in this pandemic,” emergency room physician Erin Brennan, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/us/michigan-covid-younger-people-hospitalized.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca2uHg"&gt;Unvaccinated people can also put others at risk by spreading the disease. An unvaccinated care worker in Kentucky &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395551/covid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-rare-cdc"&gt;spread a variant&lt;/a&gt; to more than 40 people in a nursing home where they worked. The Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine has also been approved for people aged 16 and older, while Moderna is approved for use in people aged 18 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ggM0qJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9549070"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QB2iAy"&gt;Other tech platforms have flagged or removed posts, videos, and other content that spreads untrue vaccine information. Twitter, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system"&gt;labels tweets&lt;/a&gt; that spread misinformation. The labels include links to relevant information from official bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the company says it enforces a five-strike system for repeat offenders that can lead to locked accounts and permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Np3xXu"&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removes posts&lt;/a&gt; that spread vaccine misinformation or anything that’s “debunked by public health experts.” This includes conspiracy theories — like vaccines containing microchips — and false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients, or side effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYADrp"&gt;Spotify has, so far, not introduced any label or banner on its content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h3Huf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eddy Cue wanted to bring iMessage to Android in 2013</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eddy cue" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZJuycE0C_knwiA0LOubDkGYm1g=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195174/iPhone5_0622.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x2NoyR"&gt;Eddy Cue pushed to bring iMessage to Android as early as 2013, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20691843-epic-games-depositions"&gt;a new deposition&lt;/a&gt; made public as part of the Epic case. Currently Apple’s senior VP of software and services, Cue wanted to devote a full team to iMessage support on Android, only to be overruled by other executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIDREN"&gt;The line of questioning is likely to play a significant role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that iOS app store exclusivity represents an illegal use of market power. Epic has made clear in previous filings that it plans to make iMessage exclusivity part of that argument, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;citing a 2016 email from Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; that argues iMessage expansion “will hurt us more than help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VLFPX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry standard”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJaIwK"&gt;The latest deposition cites a specific email exchange between Cue and Craig Federighi, currently Apple’s SVP of software engineering, beginning on April 7th and 8th, 2013. The exchange came after news circulated that &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/google-acquiring-whatsapp/"&gt;Google had attempted to purchase WhatsApp for $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. According to the exchange, Cue took the rumors as a sign that iMessage should expand to Android to cement Apple’s hold on messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2blxWJ"&gt;(Note: we have reconstructed the email based on portions verified in the deposition since the underlying exhibit has not yet been made public. Typos have been corrected throughout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3NokTr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue: &lt;/strong&gt;We really need to bring iMessage to Android. I have had a couple of people investigating this but we should go full speed and make this an official project.... Do we want to lose one of the most important apps in a mobile environment to Google? They have search, mail, free video, and growing quickly in browsers. We have the best messaging app and we should make it the industry standard. I don’t know what ways we can monetize it but it doesn’t cost us a lot to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Axsu0H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federighi: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you have any thoughts on how we would make switching to iMessage (from WhatsApp) compelling to masses of Android users who don’t have a bunch of iOS friends? iMessage is a nice app/service, but to get users to switch social networks we’d need more than a marginally better app. (This is why Google is willing to pay $1 billion — for the network, not for the app.)...In the absence of a strategy to become the primary messaging service for [the] bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned [that] iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tTFYZN"&gt;Elsewhere in the deposition, Cue says, “I remember the time of wanting to do an iMessage app on Android ourselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kneGza"&gt;“Would there have been cross-compatibility with the iOS platform so that users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages?” the questioner responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="841kd3"&gt;“That was certainly the discussion and the view that I had,” Cue says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEA05q"&gt;Cue’s argument with Federighi mirrors &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-jobs-promised-to-make-facetime-open-source-its-time/"&gt;earlier confusion over FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;, which Steve Jobs initially pledged to make available as an open standard but ultimately restricted to iOS devices. iMessage availability has been a particular sore point in the rivalry between Android and iOS, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624681/apple-imessage-android-blue-green-bubble-color-meaning-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;iMessage’s “green bubbles”&lt;/a&gt; attaching significant social stigma to Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08eHXT"&gt;Eight years later, it seems unlikely that iMessage will ever come to Android, but another passage in the deposition suggests Cue still isn’t entirely won over by Federighi’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnPR2N"&gt;“Do you believe that not having iMessage on Android has created an obstacle to families giving their kids Android phones?” the questioner asks Cue in the deposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Js5sXC"&gt;“No, not at all,” Cue replies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration says DHS can’t collect even more social media info at the border</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zqgFH2"&gt;The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has denied a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) request to expand its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647401/state-department-visas-social-media-trump"&gt;collection of social media account information&lt;/a&gt; from people entering the country, &lt;a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202007-1601-001"&gt;saying that the DHS hadn’t proved&lt;/a&gt; the information collection was practically useful. The DHS was mandated by former President Donald Trump to collect and surveil visa applicants’ social media accounts, but President Biden rescinded the executive order requiring it, a fact that was cited in the rejection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNpQyU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/a-promising-first-step-towards-curtailing-social-media-surveillance"&gt;According to the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;, the DHS’s proposal would have required 30 million applicants to include their social media accounts on immigration or foreign travel forms, expanding the measures that were already in place. The concern with the DHS requiring applicants to show their social media accounts is that it could have a chilling effect on speech — people may censor themselves out of fear that saying the wrong thing would cut off their access to travel or immigrate to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJF0Al"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that the denial doesn’t get rid of the existing measures that have been in place since 2019. However, the administration &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/183e7f1c-8a08-4bde-86a8-0c4f813bba0a"&gt;is currently taking a look at those&lt;/a&gt; as part of a review that’s set to finish on May 20th. Today’s news could be an additional sign that the new administration is interested in rolling back the current social media requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google banks big in Alphabet’s post-pandemic-peak Q1 2021 earnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YARmSwerMPL3eCEEYXj-YpUluVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194964/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sgnfKJ"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year, Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;the rare tech giant&lt;/a&gt; that actually saw a revenue decline — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345014/google-youtube-alphabet-revenue-decline-q2"&gt;the first in the company’s history&lt;/a&gt; — but only by 2 percent. To say Google has now recovered would be the understatement of the week: Alphabet’s just-released Q1 2021 earnings show it raking in a stunning amount of cash this spring, nearly as high as the all-time record revenues and profit it set last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9OcK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78"&gt;Alphabet’s filing (PDF&lt;/a&gt;) shows revenues of $55.3 billion, nearly as much as the $56.9 billion it pulled in Q4 2020, alongside $17.9 billion in profit compared to $15.2 billion. That’s also 34 percent more revenue year over year, though that’s admittedly comparing to March 2020 when the effects of some pandemic shutdowns may have been included in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCcwIN"&gt;Alphabet’s all-important Google Cloud business does still seem to be losing money — last quarter, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263048/google-cloud-loss-alphabet-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;broke out Google Cloud sales for the first time ever&lt;/a&gt; to reveal an eye-watering $5.6 billion loss in 2020. But the bleeding has slowed, with the company losing less than a billion dollars ($974M, to be precise) on over $4 billion in revenue. Each prior reported quarter saw &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; a billion in losses after pulling in &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; $4B, so those are both improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9tMBu"&gt;We also learned for the first time last year how much money YouTube brings in (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;it was a $15-billion-a-year business in 2020&lt;/a&gt;), and while YouTube didn’t pull in &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;as much money in the spring quarter as in Q4 ($6.0B vs. $6.9B previously), it’s still a huge increase from the flat $4 billion YouTube’s ads delivered a year ago in Q1 2020. Back-to-back $6B quarters for YouTube would suggest we’ll be looking at far more than a $15 billion-a-year business — assuming people don’t dramatically cut back on their YouTube viewing as vaccine availability spreads and people get back out in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nBn8Vg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In the pandemic economy, tech companies are raking it in","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5mDlgw"&gt;It’s hard to tell how Google’s hardware business is doing because Alphabet bundles it into a giant “Google Services” category that not only includes YouTube and Search but also the company’s entire ads business, the Chrome browser, and Android’s software revenue. But the company does have a “Google other” category that it makes distinct from its search and ads businesses, and that category pulled in $2 billion more year-over-year to reach $6.49 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG8XAK"&gt;Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” comprised of its experimental projects like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-waymo"&gt;self-driving company Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21401124/alphabet-verily-insurance-coefficient-stop-loss"&gt;health company Verily&lt;/a&gt;, and Google Fiber, is unsurprisingly still small. It pulled in only $198 million in revenue for an operating loss of $1.15 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEpLZk"&gt;During the earnings call, Google executives attributed some of the growth in search specifically to the pandemic, including information about the coronavirus itself and a big uptick in searches for local businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
