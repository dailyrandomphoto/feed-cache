    <title>Unionizing Amazon warehouses was never going to be easy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RverNg"&gt;For more than a year, a group of workers in Bessemer, Alabama have campaigned to unionize their warehouse under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), hoping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;force the retail giant to collectively bargain with its warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. On Friday, those hopes came to an abrupt end. In a unit-wide election, workers at the warehouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;voted against unionization by a more than 2-1 margin&lt;/a&gt;, with 738 votes in favor to 1,798 against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVDHs"&gt;It’s a devastating loss for the RWDSU and the labor movement broadly. The union is still fighting the result — filing objections and arguing that Amazon’s campaign violated labor law — but those challenges are unlikely to change the result. After dreaming of a domino effect that could unionize Amazon warehouses across the country, organizers are now fighting to keep that dream alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2FLyUC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our labor law is stacked against the people it’s meant to protect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gquXJ9"&gt;But while the lopsided result was a surprise to many, it’s part of a long, frustrating history for American labor organizers. In simple terms, not very many American workers are unionized, and organizers are used to facing an uphill battle in unionizing new workplaces. Outside of government jobs, just &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"&gt;6.3 percent of US workers&lt;/a&gt; belong to a union, a number that has fallen slightly over the past 10 years. Southern industrial workers have been a particularly sore point for the labor movement, with similar drives losing out at &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/15/733074989/tennessee-workers-reject-union-at-volkswagen-plant-again"&gt;a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2017/08/why-did-nissan-workers-vote-no"&gt;a Nissan plant in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Seen in that context, the Bessemer loss is less of a surprise victory for Amazon and more of a depressing return to the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g977bn"&gt;“It’s a blow to the labor movement, but it’s part of a pattern that’s been going on in corporate America for a long time,” says Professor Dan Cornfield, a labor sociologist at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeOb7j"&gt;Another force working against organizers is US labor law, which gives employers broad leeway to promote an anti-union message in the workplace. Amazon had campaigned aggressively against the union in recent months, posting anti-RWDSU flyers in warehouse bathrooms and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;bombarding workers with targeted text messages&lt;/a&gt;. But while organizers saw those tactics as fighting dirty, they’re all within the bounds of current law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8alpvI"&gt;“Our labor law is stacked against the people it’s meant to protect,” says Rebecca Kolins Givan, an Associate Professor at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “It’s extremely hard for workers to organize a union and ridiculously easy for employers to bully them out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eB0U9R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lethal combination for workers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQMd2a"&gt;Tactics like the “captive audience” meeting — in which employers force workers to attend anti-union workshops as part of their job — are particularly controversial among labor activists. “Part of the problem is that the law gives the employer too much latitude to interfere,” says Benjamin Sachs, Kestnbaum Professor of Labor and Industry at Harvard Law School. “So the union can’t challenge a lot of what Amazon did, like captive audience meetings, because the law is that the employer has the right to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1GJgU"&gt;Some are also pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/bessemer-alabama-amazon-union/"&gt;tactical missteps made in the campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Organizers minimized house calls with workers because of the pandemic, instead focusing on reaching workers in the area immediately outside the warehouse. There was also significant confusion over the unit itself, with organizers underestimating the number of eligible workers by thousands in the early stages of the campaign. While the 1,060-vote margin might seem daunting, it’s dwarfed by the thousands of in-unit workers who did not cast a ballot at all, whether because of indifference or intimidation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aurohb"&gt;For Cornfield, the most important force was the economics of the region. Like much of the country, &lt;a href="http://www2.labor.alabama.gov/"&gt;Alabama’s unemployment rate spiked during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, going from 2.6 percent to 13.6 percent from March to April. It was a huge economic shock to the region, and may have put a dark cloud over the union effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQXTg"&gt;“If an employer does behave aggressively and much of the workforce has experienced recession level unemployment,” Cornfield says, “that’s a lethal combination for workers who might otherwise see the merits of unionization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySRrEJ"&gt;Now that the Bessemer fight is over, there’s a lot labor groups can do to level the playing field. There’s particular hope that, under Biden, the National Labor Relations Board will start to change the rules around captive audience meetings and other tactics. The PRO Act, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975259434/house-democrats-pass-bill-that-would-protect-worker-organizing-efforts"&gt;currently awaiting a Senate vote&lt;/a&gt;, would go even further, establishing monetary penalties for executives who skirt labor laws, among other measures. But in the meantime, any future efforts to organize Amazon warehouses will face much longer odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CKOcB"&gt;“I know the outcome is not what a lot of people wanted to hear,” said Michael Foster, one of the leading RWDSU organizers in Bessemer, in a press conference on Friday. “But I believe this is the foundation for something great… by no means is this the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The week in NFTs, ranked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEodcf9wWg9rJwBaLzi1e8eAev4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106239/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NdFXNU"&gt;It’s another day in 2021, and so of course it’s another day where someone, somewhere is launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of making a ton of easy money. This week’s NFT launches were headlined by some big names — M.I.A., Tfue, Spike Jonze — and collectively posed the question: can you still, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s blockbuster NFT sale&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s, make a stupid amount of cash off these things in part by being in the right place at the right time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngUUdo"&gt;The answer, it seems, is mostly yes. And several of this week’s NFT creators were clearly here for just that possibility. Not that this NFT thing was always the exclusive realm of fine art — I present to you &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:322068:0x63f69c262122fac7fa4a1bf4eb599f63d7cb6506"&gt;this golden Pringles can&lt;/a&gt; that raises its eyebrows at you as if to say &lt;em&gt;come and try me &lt;/em&gt;— but there’s a clear feeling of function (making money) over form (being a piece of artwork) with some of these latest projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPBm9K"&gt;Because I cannot look away from the endless stream of NFT launches — good, bad, fascinating, and facepalmingly dumb — I now present you with a list of my favorite / least favorite of the last seven days. I assure you, this list is nowhere close to comprehensive; it is merely a collection of the NFTs I could remember off the top of my head while writing this story. There are truly too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BIT3o1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="vNTX8T"&gt;6. Tfue’s NFTfue collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bt3dpl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My NFTfue auction is now LIVE on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opensea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;! Head over to &lt;a href="https://t.co/gm72oFIlY1"&gt;https://t.co/gm72oFIlY1&lt;/a&gt; or tune into my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JoinClubHouse&lt;/a&gt; session tonight to learn more about the collection! &lt;a href="https://t.co/unSqzit1zl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/unSqzit1zl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tfue (@TTfue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTfue/status/1380295162849595393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tILDpc"&gt;Tfue, a popular esports player and Twitch streamer, launched &lt;a href="https://www.nftfue.com/"&gt;an NFT series&lt;/a&gt; based around cartoony versions of himself inserted into major video games. The videos look like they were quickly thrown together by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/27/267018900/for-taiwanese-news-animators-funny-videos-are-serious-work"&gt;the Taiwanese studio&lt;/a&gt; that makes those uncomfortably unnecessary animated news clips. There’s also a series of NFT bobbleheads, which, at least, come bundled with a physical bobblehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tRuNZ"&gt;“This NFT is digitally signed by Tfue, the physical Bobblehead is not signed,” the sales page warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAfm89"&gt;The team Tfue worked with expects the NFTs to sell for “somewhere between $300,000 and a million,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/04/06/tfue-nft/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xN0qlM"&gt;5. 100 Thieves’ 100 Thieves NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="T0YraC"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ2Woc"&gt;The hugely buzzy esports group 100 Thieves, which counts Drake as a co-owner, launched a series of NFTs showing their logo imposed on a vibey animation of a spinning, metallic galaxy. There are eight versions of the same animation with different color combinations used on each one. It’s kind of like buying a pin or sticker from your favorite sports team, except in this case, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/100Thieves/enter-infinity-gateway-001-19807"&gt;it’ll cost you 3 Ether&lt;/a&gt;, or around $6,250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="peBCAe"&gt;4. A film anthology featuring Flying Lotus and Spike Jonze&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQSOTN"&gt;I have no idea what you’re really buying here when you buy the NFTs associated with this collection of short films. What does it mean to own a film’s NFT, when presumably that film will continue to be screened and sold by the actual owner of the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqsPHK"&gt;Each of the short films &lt;a href="https://nftfest.io/"&gt;in this collection&lt;/a&gt; (save for one) is being sold individually as an NFT, and then the anthology as a whole (plus that additional short) is being sold as an NFT, too. Buyers get the ever-ambiguous NFT, plus a Blu-ray of the film and a display featuring a clip from the shorts. Whoever buys the anthology will get a full box set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjAC1n"&gt;The one thing I do think is compelling here is the pitch for the anthology: most of the proceeds are meant to be put back into making films so the creators can make a second volume of the anthology. I doubt NFTs are the future of film financing, but they might help supplement a Kickstarter someday soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0I0tId"&gt;3. M.I.A.’s old art NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6fOXd2"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iCUH3"&gt;M.I.A. put a few NFTs up on &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that include some old artworks of hers. Two of them are just &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/gifty-2-19511"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/gifty-1-19509"&gt;clips&lt;/a&gt; of herself from the late ’90s doing a weird dance / possible exercise class routine, and truthfully they are great. There’s also some &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/MIA/kala-coyn-17865"&gt;kaleidoscopic GIF of a coin&lt;/a&gt; that sold for 25 Ether, or around $52,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QtG2Ao"&gt;2. Another 200+ year old auction house is selling an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhtiO"&gt;Phillips, Christie’s slightly younger neighbor in London, is getting into NFTs with the sale of &lt;a href="https://www.phillips.com/mdj"&gt;an artwork called &lt;em&gt;REPLICATOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r54Vtv"&gt;At its most basic, the work is just a short video clip of a photocopier. But the twist is that the NFT will produce additional NFTs over time, all of which will be owned by the buyer of the initial work. Those NFTs will in turn produce more NFTs, and some NFTs can “jam,” stopping further replication but producing a unique “jam artwork.” After seven generations, the works will stop reproducing (so it will not be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;total &lt;/em&gt;ecological nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, like the rest of the blockchain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCuwNZ"&gt;The NFT seems like a reseller’s dream, since they’ll be in possession of a growing number of works that can be split up and resold. And what are NFTs (all of cryptocurrency, really) about if not making a questionable investment and reselling it years later for inexplicable returns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m6DTrh"&gt;At first glance, this looks like a grift on a grift: an NFT sale, of a tweet, of a photo, &lt;em&gt;from Fyre Fest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;is being put up for auction&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of raising $80,000. But the seller, Trevor DeHaas, is using the sale to fund medical bills to pay for a kidney transplant — turning it into a sort of GoFundMe in the latest bizarro horror story from America’s health care system, as my colleague Kim Lyons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in a story speaking with DeHaas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI6bPB"&gt;Honestly, this is the ultimate NFT sale, and it deserves a $69 million price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For many, COVID-19 vaccines come with a side of side effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtkY1f"&gt;Getting a COVID-19 vaccine comes with a lot of benefits. There’s the protection against a world-altering virus, the ability to travel more safely, and hanging out in people’s houses again. There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/covid-19-vaccine-krispy-kreme-donuts.html"&gt;also doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s also &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778441"&gt;a pretty good chance&lt;/a&gt; that a vaccine will be accompanied by a few unwelcome side effects. Most of these are pretty benign — like a sore arm or fatigue. Some are more serious, but those are also extremely rare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfkShI"&gt;Here’s a cheat sheet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to help you figure out what to expect after your COVID-19 shot.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMmkKj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some common side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tw5nkv"&gt;Your arm might feel sore after you get the shot, and there might be some redness or swelling near the injection site. There’s also a chance that you could develop a headache, fever, muscle pain, chills, fatigue, or nausea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN4AMa"&gt;This is all according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html"&gt;has a helpful &lt;/a&gt;page about side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Yxj1SY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NM2a9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I notice something else, not on that list? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiM9Br"&gt;The CDC’s list is of the most common side effects — there may be others that occur less frequently, or that haven’t shown up in studies yet. Researchers are still gathering data on vaccines and their side effects. In fact, one brand-new study is looking for a possible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374523/covid-vaccine-period-heavy-survey"&gt;connection between vaccines and irregular menstrual cycles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV0MZV"&gt;As with any medical treatment, take note of your symptoms and if any concern you, talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhnU6o"&gt;If you’re in the US and you want to help researchers gather data about vaccine side effects, you can also enroll in the CDC’s v-safe program once you get your shot. It’s a smartphone-based system that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;asks you about your side effects&lt;/a&gt; after you get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSDOZe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard it’s the second shot that gets you — is that true? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix3B7z"&gt;Yes, if you get a two-dose vaccine like Pfizer or Moderna, your symptoms may be more intense after your second shot than they were after your first. It’s not inherently a bad thing — it means that your body has learned its lesson from the first dose, and your immune system is now ready to fight off the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfbBqG"&gt;“Your body is primed by that first dose of vaccine.” said Melanie Swift, co-chair of the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution Work Group at Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/understanding-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-why-second-dose-could-feel-worse/"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;. “The second vaccine dose goes into your body, starts to make that spike protein, and your antibodies jump on it and rev up your immune system response. It’s kind of like they’ve studied for the test. And it’s acing the test.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A person gets their first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine in Los Angeles on April 9.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jtdWCn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is more likely to get side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mu22N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-vaccine-side-effects-women-younger-adults-2021-4"&gt;Younger people&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to see side effects. The immune system gradually weakens as you get older, this is called immunosenescence. Younger people’s immune systems are more likely to react strongly to a vaccine, making them more likely to feel side effects as their bodies go through a practice run of fighting off an infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTokuY"&gt;Women are also more likely to report side effects after getting a shot. Many women tend to have stronger immune responses to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccines are no different. But other factors, including gender bias in trial design, and inconsistent reporting &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/04/10/covid-vaccine-women-report-more-side-effects-than-men-heres-why/7139366002/"&gt;might also play a role&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez2odz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;know &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to be sore — should I take something ahead of time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoHuwP"&gt;No. “It is not recommended you take over-the-counter medicine – such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen – before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent vaccine-related side effects.” the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/prepare-for-vaccination.html"&gt;page on preparing for your COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt; says. Researchers aren’t sure if those medications might change how well the vaccines work, so they ask that people hold off, and don’t take those pain relievers, or antihistamines ahead of your appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnxsaZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After &lt;/em&gt;your appointment is a bit of a different story. While the CDC still recommends talking to your doctor before you decide to take medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html"&gt;it also says&lt;/a&gt; that you can take over the counter medications “to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD6gfo"&gt;If you are sore after your shot, the CDC recommends putting a cool washcloth over the site and moving your arm around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOWjyn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are some vaccines more likely to cause side effects than others? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Seqdv"&gt;Looks like it. A&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371665/covid-vaccine-side-effects-moderna-pfizer"&gt; study published this week found&lt;/a&gt; that people who got Moderna’s vaccine were more likely to say they experienced side effects than people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vWB3z"&gt;Both vaccines are still considered to be safe and effective. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Agriculture Workers In California Receive COVID-19 Vaccination" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkhaqy_Jupi_A-TSCGqfWzWkTwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434470/1310980701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People wait in a medical observation area after getting their shot. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bwHK9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rare, scary side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvL1IS"&gt;There have been some instances of people having a severe allergic reaction to their shots — severe enough that they need to take epinephrine or go to a hospital. That’s one reason why people are asked to hang around for medical observation for about 15 minutes after they get their vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGYnTS"&gt;Other people might have what is still considered an ‘immediate’ allergic reaction (hives, wheezing, swelling) within four hours of their shot. In those rare cases, or if you are&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html"&gt; allergic to something in the shots&lt;/a&gt;, doctors may advise you to get a different vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGTiTk"&gt;Outside the US, some researchers have noticed that in very rare instances, some people who get AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine develop serious blood clots. This &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/health/vaccine-blood-clots-astra-zeneca.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;may be because of an unusual antibody reaction&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still not certain what’s causing the clots, or who is at highest risk, though it &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/rapid-response-recommended-use-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-younger-adults.html"&gt;does appear to be safer in older people&lt;/a&gt;. This particular vaccine is not authorized for use in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjBW7q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I worry about side effects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNDFbJ"&gt;The CDC recommends that you talk to a doctor if your side effects don’t go away after a few days, or they start worrying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nipVMO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I don’t have side effects, does that mean that it’s not working? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cKpjT"&gt;While it is true that side effects are a sign that your body is building up its COVID-19 defenses, if you don’t have them, that doesn’t mean that the vaccine isn’t working. &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-you-dont-have-covid-vaccine-side-effects-are-you-still-protected/"&gt;You’re still protected&lt;/a&gt;, you just happen to be one of the lucky people whose immune system isn’t being a total jerk to you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYMHzc"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaOuuy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antivirus will be taking a break next week, April 17th. We’ll be back on April 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s well worth the read. (Monica Chin/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a big change from earlier in the pandemic, when we were all washing everything that came into our homes. Cleaning is still important — especially around someone with an active infection, but many experts now think the bigger risk of transmission is through the air. (Emily Anthes/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

If it works, it could make a big difference in the push for global vaccination. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check, Please is the feel-good queer hockey / baking comic you didn’t know you needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nF4nb69qccm7c1LsXZn3b0cTak=/0x5:1300x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106059/CheckPlease_Banner_1300x875_b13a84c2_318e_4200_b50a_eb042de304ed_1300x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ngozi Ukazu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6wu9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2KOhu"&gt;Comics can be pretty depressing these days. Existential drama, dark storylines, and epic battles for the fate of the galaxy are all regular occurrences. But on the other side of the spectrum is &lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt;, a heartwarming hockey comic that’s the feel-good equivalent of a slice of warm apple pie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTpnz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; is a webcomic / graphic novel by Ngozi Ukazu. It’s set across the four years of college for Eric “Bitty” Bittle, a gay NCAA hockey player at the fictional Samwell University. He is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a baking vlogger who loves to make pies and basically anything else. The comic’s name is a pun — “check,” like the hockey move that Bittle is terrified of as a former figure skater and “check, please” like what a customer might say at a diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIbApm"&gt;The comic spans Bittle’s time on the Samwell Men’s Hockey team, and it has something for everyone. Sports action? Check. An honest and cute queer romance? Check. Drama? Check. Baked goods? Double check. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0sJ5RrpUk7Ra6hBesWB3gZDR0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433325/CheckPlease_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ngozi Ukazu&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yxBDLd"&gt;Rounding out the cast is Jack, the captain of the team and son of a former NHL legend with his own struggles, along with the rest of the team: a group of the nicest, most diverse, fun-loving college bros that you’ll wish you could have partied with in real life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGONmh"&gt;The comic bounces from lighthearted to serious from chapter to chapter. One might deal with Bittle coming out to friends or family, another a triumphant hockey game, and a third with the team just hanging out at a diner. Ukazu gives everything its fair attention. A raucous party is treated as important as a visit from Bittle’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIlo5W"&gt;Adding to everything is the incredible artwork: Ukazu’s art is perfect for the tone, with friendly characters and warm colors that help further build out the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asI1Oq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; is written and illustrated by Ngozi Ukazu. Ukazu also ran an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/omgcheckplease?lang=en"&gt;in-universe Twitter account for Bittle&lt;/a&gt; during the run of the comic for an added dimension to the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vayofh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;You can read &lt;em&gt;Check, Please&lt;/em&gt; for free in its webcomic form through &lt;a href="https://www.checkpleasecomic.com/comic/01-01-01"&gt;Ukazu’s website&lt;/a&gt; or pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Please-Hockey-Ngozi-Ukazu/dp/1250177960?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-volume&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Please-Book-Sticks-Scones/dp/1250179505?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; (which features updated art and some additional content) if you prefer your comics in print. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic antitrust case versus Apple in Australia gets three-month stay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGTM665yR__G3wga7bj27k3Pf-Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106057/apple_fortnite_1984_parody.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qF227E"&gt;An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/04/epic-vs-apple-australia-court-case-temporarily-suspended/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo Australia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/03/apple-tried-to-kill-epics-australian-fortnite-lawsuit-this-week/"&gt;asked for a permanent stay&lt;/a&gt; of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umZUrn"&gt;The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, &lt;/em&gt;and the fees Apple charges&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; In August, Epic set up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;own in-game payments system,&lt;/a&gt; effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from its iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and tried to rally &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;protest video&lt;/a&gt; mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6PyAm"&gt;In November, Epic filed a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;similar legal claim&lt;/a&gt; against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;similar claims against Google&lt;/a&gt; and its mobile app store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLQHTl"&gt;Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clF5lN"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Apple and Epic filed proposed findings of fact documents&lt;/a&gt; for the US court case, which is set to open in California on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvDPV4"&gt;Neither Epic nor Apple immediately replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech officially discontinues its Harmony remotes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UoBIA92PUa0RZmK-mZtE6SpbSZE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69105937/jbareham_160729_1150_0031.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SAW6qz"&gt;Logitech said Friday it is discontinuing its line of Harmony universal remotes, ending years of speculation that the devices were on their way out. Models that are currently in stock at retailers will be available while supplies last, and the company says it will continue to provide support and service for the Harmony remote “as long as customers are using it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAfPQZ"&gt;“While Harmony remotes are and continue to be available through various retailers, moving forward Logitech will no longer manufacture Harmony remotes,” according to a&lt;a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000658341"&gt; blog post on Logitech’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. “We expect no impact to our customers by this announcement. We plan to support our Harmony community and new Harmony customers, which includes access to our software and apps to set up and manage your remotes. We also plan to continue to update the platform and add devices to our Harmony database. Customer and warranty support will continue to be offered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rmnj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.logitech.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2004/Logitech-Acquires-Intrigue-Technologies-Maker-of-Acclaimed-Harmony-Remote-Controls/default.aspx"&gt;Logitech acquired Intrigue Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the original maker of the Harmony remote, back in 2004. Harmony universal remotes were popular among consumers seeking one remote to rule them all— cable box, gaming console, and streaming devices. Some newer models were even able to be used with smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgEOKl"&gt;Logitech’s business has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic as people worked and schooled at home; in January, &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Logitech-F3Q21-Prepared-Remarks.pdf"&gt;the company reported its third-quarter sales&lt;/a&gt; were up 85 percent year over year to $1.67 billion, enough that it could splurge on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260033/logitech-pandemic-super-bowl-ad"&gt;its first-ever Super Bowl commercial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUE2hb"&gt;But with the rise of streaming services over the past few years, universal remotes are no longer as crucial as they once were. Logitech CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20905042/logitech-ceo-harmony-universal-remote-streaming-smart-tv-voice-assistant-bracken-darrell"&gt;Bracken Darrell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Harmony was a small business for the company; he said the remote business was only about 6 percent of the size of Logitech’s massive keyboard business, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxLzNr"&gt;“I think over time, you’ll have fewer and fewer people who feel like they really need that universal remote,” Darrell said at the time. He added that the company appreciated hardcore Harmony users who love the device: “it’s so rare to have users that love something as much as a lot of our Harmony users do. We’ll always take care of them because we really believe that that’s part of the responsibility of the brand,” Darrell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So we do love Harmony for that reason. How long it will be out there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3KbA6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx-group-1122947-nbXkQWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0fFfz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celebrate your COVID vaccination with these off-the-wall tchotchkes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDLi-SCVT3eZAVKsbcIzBaoKu_0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69105874/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hHDhe"&gt;Photographs of people getting triumphantly vaccinated against COVID-19 are all over social networks, as are announcements of upcoming appointments, first and second injections, and how well (or badly) they reacted to the vaccine. Like births, weddings, and graduations, the act of getting your Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson injection has become a cause for public celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74NCUs"&gt;So don’t you want something to mark the occasion? A souvenir of the first indication that you can begin to think seriously about hugging your relatives, entering a store without tension, and even &amp;lt;gasp!&amp;gt; eating comfortably in a restaurant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9bkd1"&gt;Sites such as Etsy, Zazzle, and Redbubble are overflowing with T-shirts, hats, and buttons proclaiming “Fully Vaccinated,” “Hug me, I’m vaccinated,” “Vaccines cause adults,” and “Vaccinated AF.” (I just report these; I don’t write them.) There are necklaces, hats, toys, keychains, and cardholders. Okay, it’s a little weird, but still... So if you want to mark your future reentry into society with something to wear, hold, or just laugh at, here are a few samples.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Q Link Wireless made private customer information accessible with just a phone number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJb9u-kfluFGrk5cnoj9cYzkYHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69104765/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5GNoTZ"&gt;A mobile carrier allowed anyone with one of its customers phone numbers to access their personal information, including name, address, phone number, and text and call history, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/no-password-required-mobile-carrier-exposes-data-for-millions-of-accounts/?comments=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The carrier, Q Link Wireless, &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/south-florida-based-hello-mobile-beats-nationwide-prepaid-prices-1028340029"&gt;claimed to have over two million customers&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETd9uD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/"&gt;noted a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; saying that the app used by the carrier and its subsidiary Hello Mobile never asked for a password or any identifying information when the user was logging on with a phone number. Looking &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-mobile-account/id1408895511"&gt;through the reviews&lt;/a&gt;, there are references to the poor security practices (to put it mildly) going back to December of 2020. While it’s unclear when the credential-less login system appeared, there is an update note from two years ago that mentions an “updated login process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apWHAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A ton of information was available in the app, which didn’t ask for a password&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKaEKS"&gt;The carrier has reportedly fixed the issue — though &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/gty65gj?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;it seems it may have done so&lt;/a&gt; by just turning off logins to the app altogether. Before the change, &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; was able to see, but not change, a bevy of information from a Hello Mobile customer who volunteered their phone number, including their name, address, account number, email address, and which numbers they’d contacted or been contacted by. The last one is probably the most sensitive — while the contents of texts or phone calls weren’t shown, there’s still a lot of information that can be gleaned from knowing who you talked to and when you talked to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J98r4"&gt;The app’s description mentions that it allows users to add more minutes or data to their plans, but it’s unclear if that required extra authentication. Regardless, there’s still a ton of information that was available to anyone able to get the phone number of one of Q Link Wireless’ customers. Reportedly, Q Link Wireless hasn’t notified its customers that their information had been accessible — which seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;a worrying trend&lt;/a&gt; among companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;that leak user data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEFee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; found no evidence that the security vulnerability was widely exploited, but having to worry about others having access to a ton of their sensitive data isn’t something that anyone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET8OCR"&gt;Q Link Wireless didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox will no longer support Amazon’s Fire TV or Echo Show devices on April 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uI4m1Zg2ilRzrQCjM1nRH9TK_v8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69104734/dseifert_210219_4433_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9L8qV"&gt;Firefox will no longer support Amazon Fire TV or Echo Show devices starting April 30th, Mozilla announced on Friday (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/09/firefox-is-ending-support-for-amazon-fire-tv-and-echo-show-devices/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n3pmQ"&gt;“You will no longer be able to install [Firefox] on FireTV, receive security updates, or be able to reinstall the app if you uninstall it starting on April 30, 2021,” &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-support-firefox-amazon-devices"&gt;Mozilla said in a support document&lt;/a&gt;. “If you have Firefox set as your default browser on Echo Show, you will be redirected to Amazon Silk for web browsing starting April 30, 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdc5Lz"&gt;Mozilla first brought Firefox to Fire TV devices in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16801908/mozilla-firefox-amazon-fire-tv-app-google-youtube-feud"&gt;December 2017&lt;/a&gt;, giving Fire TV owners a way to watch YouTube in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices"&gt;a bitter feud between Google and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2019, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;Google brought the YouTube app back to the Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;, giving users one less reason to use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7TPq1"&gt;The Mozilla-made browser first came to Echo Show devices alongside Amazon’s Silk browser with the introduction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/20/17883456/amazon-new-echo-show-2018-screen-features-price-fabric"&gt;Echo Show 10 in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;. There’s still no YouTube app for Echo Show, so the two browsers have offered a way to watch YouTube on the Amazon-made smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvfWdV"&gt;Mozilla now suggests using Silk to browse the web on Fire TV and Echo show devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mIMF9C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is back on the Fire TV, and Prime Video launches on Chromecast starting today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"},{"title":"Amazon introduces a redesigned Echo Show with a larger 10-inch display","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/20/17883456/amazon-new-echo-show-2018-screen-features-price-fabric"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X released a Montero lo-fi remix to help you study for your Demonology test </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RRssDjlhrMOz7tV4lIEf54TFTc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69104169/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_2.31.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lil Nas X&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqeGBQ"&gt;In the latest virtuoso move to promote his hit song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name),” Lil Nas X posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgh-zQJICbU"&gt;a lo-fi remix of the track to YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; Friday evening. According to his Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1380526435782127620"&gt;it’s his birthday&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems he has given us all this gift in celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPO9Al"&gt;The video, which has the full title “Lil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) but it’s lofi and something you can study to lol,” is honestly perfect. It sounds &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like something you’d hear on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow"&gt;Lofi Girl’s channel&lt;/a&gt;; if it ever gets slipped into the rotation on the channel’s iconic “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to&lt;/a&gt;” video, I wouldn’t bat an eye (ear?). Lil Nas X’s video even has five anime drawings of iconic looks from the rapper, clearly taking inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22325348/youtooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine"&gt;famous anime girl&lt;/a&gt; that is the face of the Lofi Girl channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWEbHs"&gt;This genius lo-fi remix idea isn’t Lil Nas X’s first clever adaptation of the song that he’s posted to YouTube. At the end of March, he shared “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/54KlB1Fp9Ww"&gt;MONTERO but ur in the bathroom of hell while lil nas is giving satan a lap dance in the other room&lt;/a&gt;,” which is just as excellent as the lo-fi remix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5Q08e9"&gt;There’s also “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dPp1HUKNXio"&gt;Lil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) [But Lil Nas X Is Silent The Entire Time]&lt;/a&gt;,” if you’re looking for that.&lt;/p&gt;
