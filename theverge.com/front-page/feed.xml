    <title>New York Auto Show canceled as delta variant spreads</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1oiU7a"&gt;The 2021 New York International Auto Show has been canceled as the delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States. The show was supposed to run from August 20th to August 29th at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BLTip"&gt;The show’s organizers announced the cancellation Wednesday “with great disappointment,” according to a statement, citing the spread of the delta variant and increased safety measures such as the new proof of vaccination requirements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt;announced by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week&lt;/a&gt;. The decision came suddenly, as just last week organizers revealed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMartinez_AN/status/1422970236400193536"&gt;a poster for the event&lt;/a&gt; titled “The Future is Bright.” This year’s show was supposed to have a special focus on electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3jb9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All signs were positive... but today is a different story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3e1MX"&gt;“At the onset of planning for the August Show, we were increasingly excited at the prospect of hosting the event as the number of vaccinations in New York continued to climb and mask-wearing reduced the spread in the City,” the organizers said in the statement. “All signs were positive, and the Show was coming together stronger than ever, but today is a different story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjsNlg"&gt;The 2020 New York Auto Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173663/new-york-international-auto-show-2020-canceled-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;was one of the first to get delayed&lt;/a&gt; last year as the pandemic took hold, with organizers first pushing it to August before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267785/new-york-international-auto-show-nyais-2020-canceled-coronavirus"&gt;outright canceling it&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s show was meant to be one of the first to return, following the &lt;a href="https://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/illinois-news/chicago-auto-show-2021-special-edition/article_17ca652d-baa0-58f9-9f99-3b39e6ac6e73.html"&gt;Chicago Auto Show last month&lt;/a&gt;. Others slated for later this year, such as the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, now hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXlZnB"&gt;“The Covid pandemic has challenged our City, the country and the entire world, but just like the automobile industry, we know that the New York Auto Show will rebound and be bigger and better than before,” the organizers wrote. “We firmly believe that will be the case when the Show returns to its regular spring schedule in April 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrhl1Q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whhrjv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail 101: How to increase the time you have to unsend an email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qmHbArtknVt9jT9QN7gwgLnBi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677952/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6dPXS"&gt;If you’ve ever hit “Send” on a Gmail email and regretted it ten seconds later, you’ll know how handy — even necessary — a delayed send function can be. It could be the sudden realization that you accidentally hit “Reply all,” or a feeling that you may have sent it to the wrong contact, or that there is a misspelling somewhere in there — or, perhaps worst of all, the knowledge that you just sent off an angry missive that you probably shouldn’t have. In any of these cases, a few seconds to stop that email could keep your day from imploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pt5Sc"&gt;(Gmail, of course, isn’t the only email app with this ability; other apps offer it as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwHx4K"&gt;Gmail offers a standard five-second window to allow you to change your mind and unsend the email, but if you feel that you need a little more time, you can arrange it. I find it valuable to allow myself a longer time to rethink an email; while I’ve only had to stop an email from going out a few times, those few times probably saved me from, at the very least, having to send out an apologetic follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW7NmW"&gt;You set it up using the web version of Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Ofqpzt"&gt;Click on the “Settings” cogwheel in the upper right corner, and on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kbHzEe"&gt;Under the “General” tab, look for “Undo Send.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iFX0no"&gt;Choose how long you’d like Gmail to give you to change your mind: you can select five seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, or 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pj5hW0"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1UTv0wlhqE0hJVVKpq195CPd9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759448/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.06.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUMzf0"&gt;When you click on send, you’ll see an option in the lower left corner to “Undo” your email that will last as long as you’ve set it to; it will also be available in the mobile app. If you want, you can click on “Undo” and you’ll be brought back to your email draft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Undo” link at the bottom left will let you bring back your email, unsent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XmsEr7UInHhyS6qv4KbqXtF69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759459/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.11.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Undo” link at the bottom left will let you bring back your email, unsent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Code for America employees are unionizing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDj7CHqe0oenEBxNdOyeqJZBvpM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677844/CFA_169.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nV4pEz"&gt;Employees at Code for America (CFA) announced today they are unionizing with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 1010. Organizers say 62 people have signed authorization cards, meaning 77 percent of eligible employees have indicated their support for the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWpQEf"&gt;The national nonprofit builds tech products for government agencies, including helping &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/criminal-legal-system/clear-my-record/"&gt;county courthouses automatically clear peoples’ records&lt;/a&gt; once they are eligible and operating one of the &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/social-safety-net/getcalfresh/"&gt;biggest intake sites for California food stamp benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHt3Um"&gt;Employees say they are largely happy with the work — and are better paid than colleagues at other nonprofits. Still, they feel a union could give them more of a say in business decisions. “A union gives independent contributors a seat at the table,” says Ash Campo, a CFA employee and organizer. “Unionizing allows us to rethink the barrier between staff and management, so that regular staff can have a meaningful say in decisions that affect them and benefit the organization collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV9eYQ"&gt;The announcement is part of a larger movement of white collar workers unionizing. In 2020, workers at Kickstarter formed&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt; one of the first unions made up of full-time white collar workers&lt;/a&gt; in the tech industry, also with OPEIU. Earlier this year, employees at Glitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa"&gt;signed one of tech’s first collective bargaining agreements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ryJcA"&gt;CFA’s organizing effort began almost a year ago. At first, some employees were skeptical, noting that the organization already gives employees input on policy decisions. But organizers felt this wasn’t enough. “Folks are generally happy with the way things are going and speak to the collaborative nature of management,” explains Ben Calegari, a software engineer and union organizer. “But I think an issue with that is it relies on having a relationship with managers to create change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQdQyS"&gt;Another union organizer who asked to remain anonymous agrees. “A union would give us collective power, where right now we have to rely on individual power to get things changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpPigP"&gt;Employees say they plan to advocate for better compensation and promotion policies and possibly a seat on the board. “We have an opportunity as nonprofit workers who make a little more and are better funded than others to prove that nobody is above dignified work, with the consent and input of workers,” says Calegari. “There are many people in worse conditions than ours who do not have the latitude to speak and move as freely as we do. So it’s our responsibility to use our freedom for the collective good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud6pWn"&gt;Ash Campo also says the union is a chance for CFA to fully realize its goals. “Code for America’s mission is to build technology by and for people, and for me unionizing is the actualization of that mission internally,” they explain. “We want to create policies that are built by people for people and unionizing is the only way to give us a seat at that table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW5dcz"&gt;On Monday, the union asked Code for America management for voluntary recognition. Grace Reckers, a lead organizer with OPEIU, says she’s hopeful that will happen, but notes employees are prepared if it doesn’t. “I have full confidence they would win an election if we needed to go there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCXfrc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6I4v4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s multiplayer mode is getting new content and a standalone release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-Ujovrm_2w2a2sx-Bsj7aVfWNI=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677809/51355499484_95d501812b_o_scaled.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Legends’ new Rivals mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d73nRP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima’s&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer mode, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt;, is getting some new free content and a standalone release, Sony and developer Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The standalone release will be available on September 3rd for $19.99 / €19.99 / £15.99 on both PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG1TNl"&gt;That same day, a big new 2v2 mode called Rivals will be introduced to &lt;em&gt;Legends.&lt;/em&gt; Here’s how Darren Bridges, a senior game designer at Sucker Punch, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;describes it in a blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NK5z5y"&gt;In Rivals, two teams of two will compete to defeat waves of enemies. With each defeated foe, you’ll collect Magatama that you can use to harm the other team. For example, you can spend Magatama on Shades to block your opponents’ purchases, Curses (health drain, exploding bodies, etc), Hwacha fire, and more. Once you’ve spent enough Magatama, you’ll unlock Final Stand waves. Complete these before the opposing team to win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ahg62g"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCgjNK8etz8"&gt;check out this video for a preview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zTtpyT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mCgjNK8etz8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXthDP"&gt;Alongside Rivals, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will also get a Gear Mastery system to further kit out your gear. According to Bridges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P4Npfj"&gt;Players who’ve earned 110-level gear will now be able to bind it to a class and activate “Mastery Challenges.” This will allow a piece of gear’s Ki level to be upgraded to 120 and eventually unlock a second perk slot! As you activate Mastery Challenges, you can also unlock a new Ability and new Techniques for each class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mprtsS"&gt;Sucker Punch is also launching an update to &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; on August 20th, the same day as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;the release of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that includes rebalancing Survival mode. And the developer is promising that &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will receive a “new piece of content each week from September 10th through October 1st,” including a new map for Rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahz6OL"&gt;If you pick up the standalone &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; and want to play the &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;single-player campaign, you can upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;a new island to explore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587775/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-expansion-pet-cats-deer-monkeys-sony-sucker-punch"&gt;more animals to pet&lt;/a&gt;, for $40 / €50 /£44 on PS4 or $50 / €60 / £54 on PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake for PS4 and PS5 is half off through August 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKeKP807QHUY7ZaylOBnixZs2Q8=/37x0:1657x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677587/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_E3_2019_screenshot_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SSqJ1d"&gt;If you haven’t yet played the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, now is a good time to jump in since you can get the game for up to half off its usual cost. Square Enix has slashed the price of the digital copy of the base game for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free, with &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-guide/22524412/ff7-intergrade-save-transfer-data-download-ps5-ps4"&gt;your game saves intact&lt;/a&gt;) down to $30. This matches the best deal we’ve seen yet for the digital version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPXOSg"&gt;Though, if you’re a PS5 owner and want access to the &lt;em&gt;Integrade &lt;/em&gt;downloadable content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;containing a new episode focused on Yuffie&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a great deal for you, too. Normally $70, you can get the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; for $50 — essentially making the Yuffie-focused episode a complimentary goodie on top of the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgRSm1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; launched in April 2020 for the PS4, but it received a big PS5 update in June 2021 that speeds up load times and improves graphical fidelity. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;Read our review of the game right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiAZ6Q"&gt;Flooding poses a grave risk to tens of millions more people than researchers previously estimated. Up to 86 million more people lived in flood-prone areas around the world in 2015 compared to 2000, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03695-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiuxAD"&gt;Thanks to satellite remote sensing, researchers were able to build what they say is the most comprehensive dataset of observed floods yet. It shows that more people have moved to waterfronts where they’re at risk. The findings also suggest that older flood maps used to inform urban planning and insurance policies might be underestimating the real-world risk of flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjqvpR"&gt;Just in the past month, shockingly severe floods have taken hundreds of lives in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58056667"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/world/europe/europe-floods-germany-belgium.html"&gt;Germany, and Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. In just a few days, a year’s worth of rainfall inundated Zhengzhou, a city in China’s Henan province. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/16/europe/germany-deaths-europe-severe-flooding-intl/index.html"&gt;Record-smashing rainfall&lt;/a&gt; across Western Europe overwhelmed dams and nearly washed away entire towns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLzxnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9pJJ3e"&gt;“It just really hits home, the urgency of the issue,” says Colin Doyle, one of the authors of the new study and the director of technology at Cloud to Street, a flood tracking and risk analytics platform. “It’s urgent now that we deal with the resilience issue — both adapting to the events and also creating infrastructure as a safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP1yeK"&gt;The proportion of people living in flood-prone places grew by 20 to 24 percent since 2000, according to the new research. That’s up to ten times as much as previous studies had estimated. That rise was driven by a few different factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWk9am"&gt;First, satellites have given scientists a better view of flood events. In the past, most flood maps relied on models and not observations of actual floods. Now, with more satellites in space and greater cloud computing ability, researchers like Doyle have new tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6zIwH"&gt;For their comprehensive global study, Doyle and his co-authors were able to look back at images taken daily by two NASA satellites to study floods that took place between 2000 and 2018. They paired that with data on population growth in affected areas to come to their findings. (An interactive Global Flood Database went live today to accompany the new study. On the database &lt;a href="https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, you can explore the new maps that Doyle and colleagues put together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp2o57"&gt;The satellite data also allowed Doyle and his co-authors to look at more kinds of floods than typical flood maps. They included flooding from dam failures, snow melt, and surface water floods. Modeling, on the other hand, tends to limit traditional flood maps to hazards posed when heavy rainfall causes rivers and other bodies of water to swell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QyMLA"&gt;But the rise in flood risk that Doyle and his colleagues documented isn’t merely a reflection of technological advances. New development seems to have gotten more concentrated in flood-prone places. Population growth in those risky areas outpaced global population growth over the same period. That’s partially driven by poverty and a lack of other options for many vulnerable populations, the study notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aSE3rW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdSchH"&gt;While more accurate flood maps can give city planners a better idea of where to beef up protective infrastructure, they can also tell them where &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to build in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwuCPe"&gt;“The only option for some communities will be to manage their retreat out of flood-prone areas,” writes Brenden Jongman, a senior disaster risk management specialist at The World Bank who reviewed the study and wrote an accompanying opinion article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGMG1S"&gt;There’s still more work that can be done to improve flood maps for big cities, both Doyle and Jongman note. The satellites had a harder time peering down into densely packed areas. “If you’re above New York City and looking down, you’d mostly be seeing the tops of all the skyscrapers,” Doyle says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAv26"&gt;Newer commercial satellites can take images with higher resolution, but it’s still expensive for researchers to access that data. And while newer satellites might be able to take a better picture, they haven’t necessarily been up long enough to let researchers look as far back as Doyle and his colleagues were able to with NASA’s satellites.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5blrp"&gt;Hopefully, time will unlock those tools for researchers, too. They’ll need all the help they can get to forecast future flood risk. Climate change is pushing up sea levels and eating away at coastlines and river deltas that millions of people call home. Rising global average temperatures can also &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/"&gt;soup up storms&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/extreme-precipitation-and-climate-change/"&gt;intense rainfall&lt;/a&gt; in some regions. The &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study forecasts that by 2030, even more people will be exposed to dangerous flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeYBsk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s stripped down Tab S7 FE comes to the US starting at $529 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ow9NYMTjBPfZ3pJL8754_7-x8wY=/1x0:6666x4443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677239/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_Single_KV_Mystic_Black.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab S7 FE comes with a stylus in the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uszaBp"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 FE is officially coming to the US starting on Thursday for the 5G version with the Wi-Fi model expected a few weeks later, the company has announced. The specs of the stripped-back FE, or “Fan Edition,” version of Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;flagship tablet from last year&lt;/a&gt; have been public since a listing for the tablet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451398/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-germany-no-oled"&gt;appeared on its German store in May&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have full details of its US pricing and availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz3yhb"&gt;The first version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE to release in the US will be its 5G model. It’ll be available to order starting Thursday, August 5th, from AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Samsung’s own online store, with prices starting at $669. It will also be available from other retailers, as well as T-Mobile and US Cellular “in the coming days,” according to Samsung. Meanwhile, the Wi-Fi model will be priced lower at $529, and will release beginning in September. Preorders for the Wi-Fi version open Thursday. That compares to a starting price of $649 for the Tab S7 Wi-Fi, or $849 for its 5G version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQ-9hnB0L-WWgXA23ykA_aIz74o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760297/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wi-Fi version of the tablet comes in black, silver, green, and pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zg3HR"&gt;The big selling point for the Tab S7 FE is its large 12.4-inch display, which is the same size as last year’s $849 Tab S7 Plus, although it’s LCD rather than OLED. Internally the 5G version of the Tab S7 FE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G, while the Wi-Fi version has a Qualcomm SM7325 chipset. Rounding out the specs are 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, and a 10,090mAh battery. There’s an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, and a 5-megapixel camera on the front, orientated so it’s on the top while you’re using the tablet in landscape. You also get an S Pen stylus in the box, which is helpful for note taking and sketching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh2kGg"&gt;As well as the Tab S7 FE, Samsung has also announced that the 5G version of the Galaxy Book Go laptop will be available from AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon this month. AT&amp;amp;T preorders open on August 5th, while Verizon’s availability starts on August 13th. AT&amp;amp;T is selling the laptop for $799.99. It will be available to preorder on August 5th, and will be available “in the coming weeks,” AT&amp;amp;T says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PowerA’s Fusion Pro is an enthusiast Switch controller that won’t enthuse everyone</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Customization aplenty, but the omissions are hard to ignore&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hErqEB"&gt;PowerA’s $99.99 Fusion Pro for the Nintendo Switch is made for gamers who want a more customizable controller. It’s more similar to Microsoft’s Xbox Elite than Nintendo’s Switch Pro gamepad, with a handful of components you can physically swap out to better fit your preferences. For instance, if you don’t like the way that the Fusion Pro’s analog sticks feel out of the box, you’re welcome to swap them. There are two extra sticks in the zip-up case that it ships in. In addition to the two standard sticks, there’s a much taller concave stick, as well as a tall smooth convex stick that feels more like something you might find on an arcade stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="985thc"&gt;The customization doesn’t stop there. The Fusion Pro supports swappable face plates, too. The default white plate is matte textured and feels similar to many other controllers, but the black plate has a grippier texture that blends in more seamlessly with the Fusion Pro’s rubber-coated grips. The Fusion Pro is a little bigger than the Nintendo Switch Pro, but it doesn’t stray too far in ergonomics and layout. It connects wirelessly and is just as reliable as the Nintendo-made controller when it comes to long battery life, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335994/powera-nano-enhanced-nintendo-switch-pro-look-controller-review"&gt;PowerA’s smaller Nano Enhanced controller&lt;/a&gt; that I reviewed last year. PowerA claims up to 20 hours per charge, and it has no trouble meeting that metric. This controller includes a 9.8-foot USB-A to USB-C cable to recharge or to play in wired USB mode (a switch on the back of the Fusion Pro toggles between wireless and wired modes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="trxd4G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10684120"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo9SUs"&gt;The real highlight of the Fusion Pro is on its back, where up to four mappable paddles can be installed onto a removable module called the “Pro Pack” that snaps on. You can map up to four controller functions (aside from analog movement) to the paddles, making the Fusion Pro more customizable — and accessible — than other controllers made for the Switch. The module is optional, though. If you don’t want it on the controller, it pops off easily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FNQX_zrWRlw5l0Pok6ZmpSY47Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526566/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping the paddles to one of the Fusion Pro’s buttons is simple, requiring a few button presses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk8Diz"&gt;The Fusion Pro’s rear paddles came in handy in games that have complicated control schemes like &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter: Rise&lt;/em&gt;. Even in games with simpler schemes, it can sometimes just be nice to not have to reach for a button or two, and instead rely on the paddles. I enjoyed drifting around corners in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; with a paddle instead of reaching up for a shoulder button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHrmNR"&gt;Assigning functions to the paddles is simple. There’s a button on the controller’s rear that’s dedicated to programming each paddle, and the process involves holding it for three seconds until an LED lights up on the controller’s front side. Then you tap the button you’d like to have remapped, then press the paddle to which you’d like it to be assigned. In addition to being great for simplifying a controller layout, the paddles could be a boon to some people from an accessibility standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIz2VM4xZgVBMONhyNU_8x-0re8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526569/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The level of customization is tough to beat for a Switch wireless controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerA Fusion Pro controller for the Nintendo Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eZCKg3-0y9-HzmeZxCkeQePviOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526567/cfaulkner_20210511_4580_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll only get audio through the Fusion Pro’s 3.5mm audio jack if you’re in USB mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LisG30"&gt;You can gain a lot of utility by using the Fusion Pro, but it doesn’t come particularly cheap. At $100, it’s $30 more than Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller. It’ll be worth purchasing for people who really want a few extra levels of customization, especially since it’s not a huge price boost over Nintendo’s Switch Pro controller. But it’s missing some crucial features that some people may not be ready to cut out — and ones that Nintendo’s Pro controller has up on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="391fIP"&gt;The Fusion Pro lacks vibration, and it doesn’t feature an NFC chip to read Amiibo cards and figures in games that support that functionality. Those omissions are common among third-party controllers, but it’d all be nice to have in a controller at this price. I initially was excited to discover that the Fusion Pro has a 3.5mm audio jack, but that faded once I realized that it can only be used when it’s wired to the Switch dock with its included cable. It would have also been nice if the directional pad could be swapped out for a different one, which is something that Microsoft’s Xbox Elite controller allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGFZzz"&gt;The Fusion Pro isn’t a perfect all-in-one replacement for the Switch Pro controller, and I wouldn’t suggest that most people purchase it if their needs are already met. Though, despite its flaws, the deep level of customization that it offers makes it compelling enough if you want or need custom controls on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slim keyboards for your iPad, Xbox accessories, and more are discounted today</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaHeL2"&gt;If you plan to get some typing done on your iPad, Apple’s Smart Keyboard might be a good accessory to pick up. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F5KCT/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Right now, it’s $115 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $44 off its usual price. It has plummeted to around $100 before, according to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, but this is a great deal if you need to buy right now. This model can work with the previous and current generation of the base 10.2-inch iPad, as well as the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Air or the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVPg0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uejlOK"&gt;For a little less, you can opt for a more protective and capable keyboard from Brydge. Its 10.2 Max Plus model supports the previous and latest generation of the iPad, and it adds not just a keyboard, but also a large trackpad. You’ll need to keep it charged, unlike the Smart Keyboard above, but each charge is said to last up to six months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;Read my colleague Sam Byford’s review of the larger version made for the 12.9-inch iPad&lt;/a&gt;, which has similar features to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IXreaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PCBGhd"&gt;Antonline is still offering an excellent discount on a bundle containing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; and one of Microsoft’s new Xbox wireless controllers in a bold color. Instead of paying $165 for both separately, you can get them together for $140, saving you $25. You can choose between a bundle that has &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431921"&gt;a pulse red controller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431922"&gt;a shock blue controller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431825"&gt;one with an electric volt controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FS1z6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683559"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KcROKY"&gt;If you’re &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;into making coffee, Stagg’s EKG electric kettle is steeply discounted at Nordstrom (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15190174-stagg-ekg-electric-kettle-with-wooden-accents-119-9?src=jfy%7Crecombee%7Cb8ddfda789ad3ff15ff2cb66228c75fd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Usually $150, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=1237&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals080421&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Ffellow-stagg-ekg-electric-kettle%2F5887568" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $120 in both the matte white or blue colorways&lt;/a&gt;, each with maple accents. That’s still pricier than some people may want to spend, but this product got some praise when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437846/coffee-tea-gadgets-tech-gear-accessories"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s staff shared their favorite coffee and tea-making gear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mwFkyF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685193"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRw27k"&gt;Here are some other deals that you might be interested in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dyoc83"&gt;Ponket makes a four-in-one wireless charger that can simultaneously charge your iPhone 12 series device via MagSafe, your Apple Watch, and a set of AirPods.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nET6Ee"&gt;Nissan’s Leaf 2022 range &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;starts at just $27,400&lt;/a&gt;, making it the cheapest mass market electric car currently available in the US, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/03/nissan-slashes-2022-leaf-price-below-30k-now-the-cheapest-ev-available-in-the-us/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That starting price drops to as little as $19,900 if you include the full $7,500 federal tax credit, for which Nissan vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml"&gt;are still eligible&lt;/a&gt;. These prices don’t include other charges like licensing and destination fees, or additional state-level incentives, but it’s a promising sign of how affordable electric vehicles are becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1k8F3"&gt;The exact price difference between Nissan’s 2021 and 2022 Leaf cars varies from model to model. The entry-level Leaf S, which has a 40kWh battery, has reduced by $4,270 from $31,670 to $27,400, undercutting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936110/bmw-electric-mini-cooper-ev-range-price-release"&gt;electric Mini Cooper’s starting price of $29,990&lt;/a&gt; (the electric Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-most-affordable-electric-cars-on-the-market-11619206485"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/car-lists/cheapest-evs-2021/"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; as the cheapest electric car currently available in the US). However Nissan’s biggest price drop can be found with the top-of-the-range 62kWh Leaf SL Plus, which has gone down in price by $6,570 from $43,970 to $37,400. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zncCdYFigBqA0UFN9oO5Sl-7amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760339/21LEAF7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nissan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Leaf is available with up to an estimated 226 miles of range. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zPFhm"&gt;Despite the drop in price, the specs of the new Leaf cars are broadly unchanged from previous years. You should still get an estimated 149 miles of range from the 40kWh model, or between 215 and 226 miles from the 62kWh version. However, all 2022 models now include a CHAdeMO quick-charging port, plus a portable 240-volt charging cable, which should provide more flexibility when topping up the car’s battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gzk6Ep"&gt;The Leaf is currently the only electric car Nissan sells in the US, but later this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324125/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-crossover-specs-price"&gt;it will release the Ariya&lt;/a&gt;, a new electric crossover SUV with up to 300 miles of range. Announced last year, the Ariya is due to go on sale in Japan in the middle of the year, with the US and Canada to follow and pricing starting at around $40,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyeXeH"&gt;Nissan’s 2022 Leaf is on sale now, &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;Nissan says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
