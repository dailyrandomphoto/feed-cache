    <title>Arm’s first new architecture in a decade is designed for security and AI</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5tgzt"&gt;Chip designer Arm has announced Armv9, its first new chip architecture in a decade following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/28/2522146/arm-reveals-64-bit-architecture-armv8-expects-prototype-systems-in"&gt;Armv8 way back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. According to Arm, Armv9 offers three major improvements over the previous architecture: security, better AI performance, and faster performance in general. These benefits should eventually trickle down to devices with processors based on Arm’s designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWCTbJ"&gt;It’s an important milestone for the company, whose designs power almost every smartphone sold today, as well as increasing numbers of laptops and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300097/fugaku-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-top500-riken-fujitsu-arm"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple announced its Mac computers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;transition to its own Arm-based processors last year&lt;/a&gt;, and its first Apple Silicon Macs released later in the year. Other manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have also released Arm-based laptops in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQxszL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Benefiting the wide array of machines using Arm-based processors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7iO0ck"&gt;First of the big three improvements coming with Armv9 is security. The new Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), attempts to protect sensitive data with a secure, hardware-based environment. These so-called “Realms” can be dynamically created to protect important data and code from the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4j4VN"&gt;Next up is AI processing. Armv9 will include Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2), a technology that is designed to help with machine learning and digital signal processing tasks. This should benefit everything from 5G systems to virtual and augmented reality and machine learning workloads like image processing and voice recognition. AI applications like these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;are said to be&lt;/a&gt; a key reason why Nvidia is currently in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;buying Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qTar0"&gt;But away from these more specific improvements, Arm also promises more general performance increases from Armv9. It expects CPU performance to increase by over 30 percent across the next two generations, with further boosts performance coming from software and hardware optimizations. Arm says all existing software will run on Armv9-based processors without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdbPT"&gt;With the architecture announced, the big question is when the processors using the architecture might release and find their way into consumer products. Arm says it expects the first Armv9-based silicon to ship before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8SQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhZrFc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy and ads in Chrome are about to become FLoCing complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H8u-yfv7VkEFjrDeTPEYqupbyn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049691/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google is forging ahead with its third-party cookie replacement technology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U3YqX7"&gt;Repent, o ye ad trackers, for the cookiepocalypse is nigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNP7Co"&gt;If Google sticks to its roadmap, by this time next year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Chrome will no longer allow websites to use third-party cookies&lt;/a&gt;, which are cookies that come from outside their own domains. The change theoretically makes it vastly more difficult for advertisers to track your activities on the web and then serve you targeted ads. Safari and Firefox have already blocked those cookies, but when it comes to market share, Chrome is currently the leader and so its switchover is the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy6BTy"&gt;Blocking third-party cookies means that only websites you explicitly visit will be able to save those little cookie files on your computer, and they should theoretically only do what cookies were originally intended to do: keep track of smaller things like whether you’re logged in or which shopping cart is yours. Blocking third-party cookies also means ad networks can’t figure out who you are and serve you targeted ads, which is a big problem for the ad industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCFctf"&gt;Google, which is the biggest player in online ads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; that it does not intend to replace third-party cookies with “alternative identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web.” This seems like a win for privacy all around, but if something about the story of Google as the privacy and anti-ad crusader strikes you as a little... off, you are far from alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkgCd8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nt7rfK"&gt;Because of course Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry — the one it dominates and from which it makes all its money. Instead, Google wants to replace the third-party tracking cookie with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising#ideas-and-proposals-links-outside-this-repo"&gt;complicated set of (bird-themed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove"&gt;) technologies&lt;/a&gt; that are meant to let ad companies target specific demographics like age and location, while at the same time allowing the people who are targeted to remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHIMox"&gt;Google is trying to avert the cookiepocalypse for the ad tech industry, no repentance necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jLW3d"&gt;And so today, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/"&gt;company is forging ahead with an “origin trial” for one of these new technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). In an &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md"&gt;origin trial&lt;/a&gt;, websites are able to begin testing without asking browser users to turn on specific flags. The feature itself will be slowly turned on inside Chrome via the usual process of introducing it into developer builds, then beta, then finally in the shipping version most people use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6ALbh"&gt;But what the hell is FLoC, and does it really protect your privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR5S6t"&gt;FLoC: a Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UnuGjX"&gt;FloC is a proposed browser standard that, in Google’s words, will enable “interest-based advertising on the web” without letting advertisers know your identity. Instead, you’ll be associated with a “cohort,” a group of users sufficiently large enough to make you at least semi-anonymous to the companies targeting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFgCKf"&gt;That’s the simple explanation. The technical one gets very complicated very quickly. Here’s a quick version. Chrome browsers will use algorithms (the “Federated Learning” part) to create a very large number of “cohorts,” groups of people that share certain qualities and interests. Each person’s individual browsing history is kept private and never shared with anybody, but the browser itself will look at the history and then assign a user to one of those cohorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cG9z2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of identifying you individually, FLoC wants to make you part of a “cohort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnzzMp"&gt;When you visit a website, Chrome will tell that site that the visitor is part of cohort 198273 (or whatever) and then it’s up to the website to know that cohort 198273 (or whatever) is interested in pickup trucks and shoes with vegan leather. Since Chrome will never assign a user to a small cohort (Google has proposed that it will wait until there are “thousands” in a group), your identity as an animal-loving &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal"&gt;coal roller&lt;/a&gt; is theoretically protected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBoWj8"&gt;Chrome itself isn’t assigning any content labels to these FloCs; Google is leaving that to the ad tech industry to figure out. So you won’t be able to open up a privacy page inside Chrome and see what it thinks you’re interested in (though there’s theoretically nothing stopping a third-party website from telling you). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JzTu5"&gt;Since FLoC is structured in this way, it could mean that the powerful players in ad tech could become even more entrenched, because they have the technology to parse what FLoCs mean and what ads to target against them. Or it could mean smaller players could find a way in. We don’t know all the possible repercussions of FLoC, which is why it has both ad industry executives and privacy advocates so unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUHz46"&gt;You can read the whole proposal and even check out the code for how it works at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc"&gt;GitHub repository for FLoC&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href="https://wicg.github.io/admin/charter.html"&gt;Web Incubator Community Group&lt;/a&gt;. As with most things on the web, it’s being developed out in the open and is part of a process of proposals, critiques, counter-proposals, attempts to get other browser vendors to join, arguments, harangues, screeds, and good-faith efforts to make the web a better place. It’s a party, y’all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X9mQ2C"&gt;The new front in the browser wars: privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PM0Zxy"&gt;No other browser vendor has signaled its intention to support FLoC. The rest are simply blocking third-party cookies and letting the chips fall where they may. And those chips are messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc6BTO"&gt;Whatever motivations you want to imbue on the Chrome team, it is already apparent that simply blocking third-party cookies will lead to very problematic new solutions from the ad tech industry. So Google is creating both FLoC and a suite of other technologies to replace the third-party cookie, in order to hopefully forestall even worse replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2W2zba"&gt;One of the very bad things Google is trying to forestall is fingerprinting. That’s the generalized term for ways that websites can identify you through little data signals that leak out of your browser when you visit a site. Sites can look at your IP address, the OS you’re browsing from, the size of your window, whether your browser supports Bluetooth controllers, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swJfEu"&gt;Battling fingerprinting is a huge arms race for browser engineers and new, nefarious methods pop up seemingly weekly. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/"&gt;new method of fingerprinting I just came across&lt;/a&gt;: playing a very tiny bit of audio and then analyzing how your particular browser and device handle it, and then using that data to individually identify you in milliseconds. (The website that proposed it &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/why-fpjs/"&gt;sells fingerprint services to legitimate companies&lt;/a&gt; so they can ostensibly use it to better identify potential fraudsters on their sites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h3vA9w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fighting browser fingerprinting is a huge arms race to protect your identity and privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LwbgD"&gt;Apple has very publicly and vociferously advocated for cutting off all methods of individualized tracking, including fingerprinting, and has committed itself to that arms race indefinitely. The Chrome team’s concern is that essentially such a hard line creates an incentive for legitimate ad tech companies to start engaging in fingerprinting, which will then be all but impossible to stop or regulate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t89Rm2"&gt;Here’s how Google puts it in its blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qpzLCK"&gt;When other browsers started blocking third-party cookies by default, we were excited about the direction, but worried about the immediate impact. Excited because we absolutely need a more private web, and we know third-party cookies aren’t the long-term answer. Worried because today many publishers rely on cookie-based advertising to support their content efforts, and we had seen that cookie blocking was already spawning privacy-invasive workarounds (such as fingerprinting) that were even worse for user privacy. Overall, we felt that blocking third-party cookies outright without viable alternatives for the ecosystem was irresponsible, and even harmful, to the free and open web we all enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TRvPBc"&gt;It’s hard to separate each company’s financial incentives from their very real philosophical differences. Google prints money with its de facto monopoly on monetizing the open web through ads and is therefore incentivized to keep it going. At the same time, Chrome’s developers are true believers in the power and importance of the open web. Meanwhile, Apple wouldn’t be sad if Google made less money amid a massive online ad tracking reckoning. At the same time, Apple’s developers are true believers in the importance of personal privacy and the urgent need to go all-out in protecting that privacy against constant online assaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJqFdO"&gt;In any case, the problem with fingerprinting is that once you’re identified, it’s much harder to anonymize yourself. A cookie can be deleted, but the way your particular computer processes a milliseconds-long snippet of audio is much harder to change (though Brave has an innovative solution called &lt;a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-4/"&gt;Farbling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5SJzZ"&gt;The basic argument from the Chrome team is that erecting a so-called “privacy wall” will entice legitimate ad tech companies into succumbing to the temptation of fingerprinting. Google is hoping that ad tech companies will adopt FLoC as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBfw8T"&gt;If nothing else, there’s one big thing to take away from all this: FLoC is a hell of a lot better than the current status of third-party cookies that directly identify you anywhere you go on the web. But “better than the worst” is a low bar, and it’s hard to know yet whether FLoC just clears it or vaults way over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZINDvs"&gt;Is FLoC really private?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lkhzqX"&gt;Instead of a trying to build a metaphorical privacy wall that blocks all forms of ad targeting, Google plans on building a &lt;a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; inside Chrome. Within that sandbox, websites can still legitimately request to know certain details about your browser as they need. A game streaming site could ask to know if your browser supports a game controller, for example. But ask too much and you’ll exceed the browser’s “privacy budget” and get cut off. Websites can have just a little identifying information, as a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbHOiE"&gt;FLoC will be part of that privacy sandbox and further should protect your identity by only associating you with a cohort if that cohort is sufficiently large. Chrome will also change what FLoC cohort your browser is associated with on a regular basis, say once a week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWzm7e"&gt;But whether FLoC is actually anonymous is very much up for debate. Bennett Cyphers at Electronic Frontier Foundation recently put up a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;handy post detailing some of the biggest concerns with FLoC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3qB4c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FLoC could potentially identify you as being part of an at-risk group&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8jNV"&gt;One of the key aspects of FLoC is that Google isn’t making some giant list of interests and demographics and then assigning you to them. Instead, it’s proposing to use Federated Learning to create a ton of these cohorts algorithmically. Chrome won’t really know what any of them are actually about; it’ll be up to ad tech vendors to understand that over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtlJPS"&gt;But as Cyphers points out, that algorithm will inevitably create cohorts that could be incredibly dangerous — say, a group of people who have visited sites about getting out of domestic abuse situations. The Chrome team says it recognizes this concern and so will be analyzing the algorithmically created cohorts to see if any are related to what it deems to be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en"&gt;sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt; — and then Chrome won’t serve those cohort IDs. But FLoC isn’t centralized, so it’s important to know that if another browser vendor adopts FLoC, it will be incumbent on that browser to create similar block lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXp4M0"&gt;Websites will be able to opt out of participating in FLoC, meaning that visits to their sites won’t contribute to an individual FLoC user’s profile. Similarly, the Chrome team intends to put opt-out toggles somewhere in Chrome’s settings for users who don’t want to provide FLoC IDs to the websites they visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbojiV"&gt;Could FLoC become just another data point for fingerprinters? It seems likely, and defending against that seems to be another job for Chrome’s privacy budget and privacy sandbox algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWJdL1"&gt;One more thing: FLoC is a very convenient way for the websites you visit to know enough about you to target relevant ads, which means that FLoC is a very convenient way for websites to know things about you. It’s certainly no worse than the current cookie situation, but it’s far from the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNrvnY1mo0"&gt;You Shall Not Pass!&lt;/a&gt;” philosophy other browser vendors (like Apple and Brave) apply to allowing access to potentially identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iMjQpO"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WOiYUZ"&gt;This first FLoC “origin trial” is designed to help websites learn how FLoC works; some of the testing for Chrome users will come later. Here is how Google describes the way it’s going to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vDlLMw"&gt;The initial testing of FLoC is taking place with a small percentage of users in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines and the U.S. We’ll expand to other regions as the Privacy Sandbox expands globally. In April, we’ll introduce a control in Chrome Settings that you can use to opt out of inclusion in FLoC and other Privacy Sandbox proposals. In the meantime, if you’ve chosen to block third-party cookies, you won’t be included in these origin trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EvtG3R"&gt;If you look at that list of countries, you might notice that something stands out: none of them are in the EU, where GDPR regulations are in effect. Recently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1374389427716321286"&gt;Robin Berjon of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wondered&lt;/a&gt; whether that meant that FLoC would run afoul of those privacy regulations. According to the product manager for the Chrome privacy sandbox, Marshall Vale, it’s more a matter of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marshallvale/status/1374494962646020098"&gt;limiting the size of the early tests and that his team&lt;/a&gt; is “100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bfhf19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"And now, a brief definition of the web","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PxhEI3"&gt;Under normal circumstances, a newly proposed web technology wends its way through mailing lists and W3C conference room debates. It gets supported by the browser vendor that championed it and then, if its lucky, other browsers. Thus, the web manages to not become browser-specific in the ways it was back in the bad old days of Internet Explorer 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxA8W"&gt;But when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Google originally announced its intention to block third-party cookies last year&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out that the rhetoric between browser vendors was getting sharp. It’s only gotten sharper as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Brave, and others have gone further down their respective paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqECse"&gt;It seems unlikely that FLoC will lead to a standard because everybody agrees on a good way to allow targeted advertising. If FLoC does become a standard, it’ll probably be because Chrome will eventually turn it on and it will become the norm just through sheer market share — both Chrome’s within the browser market and Google’s within the ad tech market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="54fTFu"&gt;That possible future might avert the cookiepocalypse, but it could also become a different kind of nightmare for the web: one where websites once again try to push you to use the browser they can best monetize via whatever ad tech platform they’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WrLum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red is changing how it makes games after disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO_jXMdoWt0XhCr6Th8tnQxdk9w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049625/screen_ripperdoc_clinic_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cdpU1h"&gt;Polish game studio CD Projekt Red announced a sweeping restructuring plan on Tuesday, just months after the disastrous launch of its much-hyped title &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. One of the key goals of the new plan brings “a change in the way [the studio] develops video games,” according to a press release. The changes will allow CD Projekt Red to work on “multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01zpnN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launched in December after years of hype; the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs"&gt;first teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the game was released in January 2013. And following the huge success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/22/10636822/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-best-video-game-2015"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, expectations were sky-high for the studio’s cyberpunk RPG, especially following the glitzy and action-packed trailers shown in the months leading up to the game’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhVkq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Cyberpunk 2077’ was riddled with bugs when it launched&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REZjSJ"&gt;But the game, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;reported six-day workweek&lt;/a&gt; for the developers ahead of the launch, was riddled with bugs and performance issues when it was finally available, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;particularly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The performance was bad enough that Sony took the extraordinary step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and offering refunds. (More than 100 days later, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; still hasn’t returned to the store.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpbKe2"&gt;In the months since launch, CD Projekt Red has released numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;even hotfixes for the updates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to shore up &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; issues and get it running smoothly. (Just yesterday, the studio released an update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;with hundreds of fixes&lt;/a&gt;, though there still seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22358419/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-patch-update-1-2-driving-cars-cops?utm_campaign=polygon&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;some hilarious bugs&lt;/a&gt;.) Many of the plans announced on Tuesday seem to be in service of preventing another high-profile fiasco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQARLf"&gt;One major change is that CD Projekt Red plans to change how its proprietary REDengine game engine is developed, which could improve performance for future games. “The Studio’s REDengine technology will be improved and centralized, while reorganizing the Studio as a set of interdisciplinary agile teams will transform the way games are developed, making its approach more proactive,” CD Projekt Red said. Theoretically, those changes could prevent issues in future games where games run much more poorly on older consoles, like many experienced with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdBadN"&gt;Single-player RPGs “will remain our priority,” Michał Nowakowski, the studio’s SVP of business development, said in a statement, and you can expect to see more of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. “We also perceive the huge potential of both &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, and we want to expand their reach to include new areas, media and content types,” Nowakowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvnHWi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Single-player RPGs ‘will remain our priority’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6K4hCV"&gt;Despite the focus on single player, CD Projekt Red does plan to expand its games’ online capabilities, though the studio wasn’t specific about what those features might be. These online features will be gradually rolled out to CD Projekt Red games, the studio said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh0XcI"&gt;And perhaps recognizing that the years-long promotional campaign for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; may have backfired, CD Projekt Red committed to changing how it promotes its future games. “Future marketing campaigns will be much shorter, with promotional content released closer to the actual release of the given game, presenting its operation on all supported hardware platforms,” CD Projekt Red said. The company is also committing to publishing a new roadmap each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfbKHX"&gt;The studio also committed to improving working conditions for its employees. “CD Projekt will remain an inclusive and diverse workplace; however, we also want to emphasize the well-being of our employees and provide them with professional and personal development opportunities,” studio head Adam Badowski said in a statement. CD Projekt Red did not provide further specifics about what changes will be made. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesia: Rebirth has a new ‘Adventure Mode’ with no monsters, new puzzles, and more lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amnesia: The Dark Descent cave" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHpsTCko9Q7jk5L1Ql3VPIGbOGY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049319/Rift.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xwQM7l"&gt;If you like puzzles and eerie deserts, but not darkness and horrifying ghouls, Swedish studio Frictional has a new version of its game &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; for you. A less stressful “Adventure Mode” is being added to &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; today via GOG, Steam, and the Epic Store. The game’s PlayStation version will get Adventure Mode in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYcWZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth, &lt;/em&gt;released last year, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519899/amnesia-rebirth-frictional-games-pc-ps4-horror-review"&gt;a strong sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the notoriously scary &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Adventure Mode removes encounters with &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt;’s numerous monsters, as well as special effects that damaged its protagonist Tasi’s mental state. It also adds light to the game’s spookier levels, so players won’t have to ration matches or face the darkness. And Frictional says it’s adding bonus puzzles to Adventure Mode, so while you might spend less time sneaking and hiding, you’ll theoretically have more classic adventure game mechanics to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amnesia: Rebirth Adventure mode comparison shot, showing added light to a dark level" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1F1lqTA98XvCMDWA9ZgFK5gPoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408212/OriginalAdventure_Vertical.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dCTYFA"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Fredrik Olsson describes it, “the game still has its very serious theme and sometimes unnerving ambience, but the new mode feels a lot more like an &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; type of adventure in places where it would otherwise be more of a horror experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ryydd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Frictional added a similar “safe mode” for ‘Soma’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3tMLf"&gt;Adventure Mode is comparable to &lt;a href="https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-somas-safe-mode.html"&gt;the Safe Mode that Frictional added&lt;/a&gt; to its 2015 horror game &lt;em&gt;Soma&lt;/em&gt;. But Safe Mode was a relatively simple mod that stopped monsters from attacking players, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/somas-new-safe-mode-takes-the-survival-out-of-survival-horror/"&gt;broadening the appeal&lt;/a&gt; of a world where failure could be seriously frustrating. Games like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/hades-guide/21456205/god-mode-difficulty-easy-damage-reduction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have adopted similar systems, giving a boost to players who want to enjoy the standard game at a lower difficulty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZWkUd"&gt;Adventure Mode sounds like a broader aesthetic change to a game that already helped players progress if they “died,” albeit at a subtle narrative cost. It’s aimed at making the overall atmosphere more approachable, or as Frictional puts it, removing “anxiety-inducing and very distressing elements present in the original game.” It sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release"&gt;a little more like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Origins&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;educational mode, which swapped combat for a museum-style tour — although Frictional is still keeping players focused on &lt;em&gt;Rebirth’s&lt;/em&gt; original narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLaPm2"&gt;Frictional expressed ambivalence about giving &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; a “safe mode” before launch, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/884kzb/why-the-developers-of-amnesia-waited-10-years-to-make-a-sequel"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that removing monsters “wouldn’t make story-wise sense.” Adventure Mode may get around that issue by tweaking the game’s entire world — not just the parts that can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch will look and run better after its latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyXVznhHET_gLcYd0qQjVoheMZk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049175/fortnite_battle_royale_50_on_50_1920.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztSGlO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is getting a patch that will boost performance in portable and docked modes. &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/gpu-performance-and-resolution-boost-for-fortnite-on-nintendo-switch"&gt;Epic Games says&lt;/a&gt; the game will run with a more consistent frame rate across the board “with fewer hitches,” though it’s still not 60 frames per second. And while the game will still use dynamic resolution to make visual adjustments on the fly to keep things running as smoothly as possible, the target resolutions in handheld and docked modes have gotten upgrades, too, seeing a 38 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZQcKJ"&gt;In handheld mode, the game has gone from 1000 x 560 up to 1170 x 660, which is closer to the Switch display’s 720p resolution. In docked mode, it’ll go up to 1560 x 880 instead of topping out at 1390 x 780. That’s a little closer to native 1080p docked resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hLuy3"&gt;What this means is that the game will look less blurry, a common problem that many third-party ports encounter. The team provided a quick visual sample comparing pre-patch and post-patch sharpness to let you see what it might look like in-game. It’s definitely a noticeable improvement, even if it’s minor. Anyone squeezing more juice out of the aging Switch hardware gets kudos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFKQSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10420122"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnsGvu"&gt;Lastly, the team says the game will free up 140MB of storage on your console, marking a small reduction in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; file size. Companies seem to be prioritizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356947/call-of-duty-activision-file-size-shrink-space-savings-warzone"&gt;these kinds of updates these days&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s great for people who are still installing games to the Switch’s internal storage (despite microSD cards being extremely affordable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ZO5wI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s dinosaur eggs have hatched, and now raptors roam the island","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357140/fortnite-primal-update-egg-hatch-dinosaur-raptor"},{"title":"How AI, not just hardware, could make a new Switch more powerful than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7JT5j0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YhbTu2"&gt;A site called &lt;a href="https://vaxhelp.nyc/"&gt;vaxhelp.nyc&lt;/a&gt; takes you through step-by-step instructions on how to navigate the New York State-run vaccine site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DyhcNt"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFo3y1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatepa.org/"&gt;VaccinatePA&lt;/a&gt; uses a team of volunteers to call hospitals and pharmacies for information on where appointments are available, where you can get on a waitlist, and whom to contact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3D44TY"&gt;If you’re on Slack, you might want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.texasupdates.com/"&gt;Texas Vaccine Updates&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get alerts on availability at various venues and find discussions on topics like how to prove eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state, and it has its own &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/findashot/id1556177037"&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt;. A site named &lt;a href="https://www.findvaccinenow.com/"&gt;Vaccine Now&lt;/a&gt; offers to find sources not only in the US, but in the UK, Germany, India, Pakistan, and the UAE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated to helping people find COVID vaccinations. VaccineFinder lets you search using your ZIP code and is singular in that it allows you to filter for the Moderna, Pfizer / BioNTech, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. For example, a startup nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.brydgehealth.org/"&gt;Brydge Health&lt;/a&gt; tries to make connections between those who need help getting an appointment and volunteers who can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all of the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York Opens 14 Pop-Up Vaccination Sites Throughout State" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fO5w88qUpMva_wnxOF_Q1KLSbNs=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049121/1309318485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aazvjm"&gt;Three months after the United States’ COVID-19 vaccination campaign began, researchers are starting to collect data showing that the vaccines are just as good in the real world as they were in the clinical trials testing them. Recent studies have consistently shown that the vaccines don’t just protect against symptoms — they reduce the risk that someone will get infected with the coronavirus, a signal that they’ll reduce the spread of the virus, not just prevent sickness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6h3vW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer / BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; vaccines were both around 95 percent effective at protecting people against symptomatic COVID-19 in large trials. It was never guaranteed that they’d perform just as well when they were distributed to the general public. Despite the best efforts of researchers to closely mimic the real world in a clinical trial, they’re never quite the same. The types of people who volunteer for trials sometimes aren’t representative of the general population. Certain groups, like pregnant people, weren’t recruited for the trials. The dose administration was in a more controlled environment than mass vaccination sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJUa0d"&gt;That’s why it’s so encouraging to see these vaccines do just as good a job protecting people outside of the clinical trials. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced encouraging results from a study designed to check how well the COVID-19 vaccines could protect frontline workers against infections in a real-world setting. Just under 4,000 health care workers and first responders &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w#contribAff"&gt;swabbed themselves weekly&lt;/a&gt; over 13 weeks to check for the virus. In that group, which is regularly exposed to COVID-19 at work, two shots of the vaccines were 90 percent effective against infection. A single dose was also protective; it prevented 80 percent of infections. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mx3oHg6C39gd0artDq6gbLM_ANw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408006/mm7013e3_COVIDVaccineFieldEffectiveness_IMAGE_29Mar21_v2_1200x675_medium.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fI3sg4"&gt;The CDC’s results build on other research that has had similarly good findings. The first real-world data on vaccines came from Israel, which had a fast start to its COVID-19 vaccination program. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; from February compared around 600,000 people who had been vaccinated with the Pfizer / BioNTech shots to 600,000 people who had not been vaccinated. It found that it was 94 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 a week after the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YAdt5"&gt;In the United States, the first data came from people living in long-term care facilities and health care workers — who also happened to be the first people to get the vaccine in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUwTpc"&gt;A close look at the long-term care facilities was especially important for researchers because the people living in them are elderly and very vulnerable to COVID-19. In addition, vaccines sometimes don’t work as well in older adults. So it was good news to see that just one dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e3.htm#contribAff"&gt;63 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; against infection — not just symptoms — of the coronavirus in two long-term care facilities in Connecticut, according to a CDC report from March. &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623v1.full.pdf"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that the shots were also 88 percent effective against coronavirus infections in a group of Mayo Clinic patients vaccinated between December 2020 and early February 2021, presumably all long-term care facility residents and health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIFUS"&gt;As vaccination campaigns around the world continue, researchers will keep collecting data and tracking their effectiveness in different groups. There are still unanswered questions — experts still want to know how the available vaccines &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/real-world-study-to-offer-look-at-how-covid-19-vaccines-stack-up"&gt;compare to each other&lt;/a&gt;, how long protection lasts, and how well they work in people who are &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/91775"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCCvYP"&gt;But the studies we have so far are early signals that the COVID-19 vaccines are working, and working extremely well. That makes holding off the looming &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/cdc-cases-warning-fourth-surge"&gt;fourth coronavirus surge&lt;/a&gt; in the United States even more important: the more people stay safe now, the more get the benefit of the lifesaving shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BrrOu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0IJIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game of Thrones is heading to Broadway with a new prequel play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_-y6TK5sJCNZN1eKyDkkx1lpQY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049046/ep01_sean_bean_04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="14weUB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; has often been called out for its near-Shakespearean levels of intrigue and theatrical drama. So it’s not exactly a surprise that the next move for the franchise is to the stage: a new Broadway show based on George R.R. Martin’s popular fantasy series is now in the works, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-of-thrones-play-in-the-works-for-broadway-will-revive-iconic-characters-exclusive?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3HLpm"&gt;The goal is to stage the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; play starting in 2023, with plans for productions in New York City, London’s West End, and Australia. Dominic Cooke is set to direct, with Simon Painter and Tim Lawson on board as producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kwfviw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Coming in 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Crc2Cf"&gt;The play is said to be a prequel set during &lt;a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Harrenhal"&gt;The Great Tourney at Harrenhal&lt;/a&gt;, 16 years before the events of Martin’s &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; book series (and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, HBO’s blockbuster TV series adaptation). Fans will recognize that tournament as the start of the pivotal events in the lead-up to the books and show, which (mild spoilers) would eventually lead to Robert Baratheon’s rebellion and the overthrow of the Targaryen dynasty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxBq8P"&gt;And while HBO isn’t involved in the production (at least for now), the as-yet-unnamed play would give fans a chance to revisit popular characters like Ned Stark, Jaime Lannister, Robert Baratheon, Oberyn Martell, Barristan Selmy, Arthur Dayne, and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w55OdV"&gt;“The seeds of war are often planted in times of peace,” Martin said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;. “Few in Westeros knew the carnage to come when highborn and smallfolk alike gathered at Harrenhal to watch the finest knights of the realm compete in a great tourney, during the Year of the False Spring. It is a tourney oft referred during HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, and in my novels, &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; … and now, at last, we can tell the whole story... on the stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS2QvE"&gt;Martin is involved in the production and is working with playwright Duncan Macmillan on the story. That adds yet another item to his already crowded plate of projects, including serving as an executive producer on &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and at least two other TV shows and his new five-figure deal with HBO to develop new shows and films for HBO Max. Additionally, HBO is already working on at least five more &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs, which will presumably see Martin’s involvement in some fashion. And of course, there’s his work on the &lt;em&gt;long-&lt;/em&gt;awaited final books in his &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire &lt;/em&gt;series — &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Dream of Spring&lt;/em&gt; — which Martin has been working on for nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNRLzw"&gt;Martin’s series wouldn’t be the first major fantasy story to make the jump from page to screen to stage. The most obvious precedent is &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt;, the two-part Potter play that serves as a sequel to the popular series of books, with a story from author J.K. Rowling that continues the events of the series. That play, which opened in London in 2016, has since expanded with productions on Broadway in NYC and in Melbourne, with a planned run in Toronto set for 2022. &lt;em&gt;Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt; has also been a critical and commercial success, winning six Tony Awards in 2018 (including Best Play) and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/01/broadway-harry-potter-to-kill-a-mockingbird-box-office-records-musicals-frozen-aladdin-1202527930/"&gt;bringing in record-setting revenues&lt;/a&gt; — despite a somewhat lukewarm reception by fans of the story itself. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLzAOK"&gt;In early November 2015, a polar bear cub named Nora was abandoned by her mother at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, leaving her fate in the hands of a team of veterinarians and zookeepers. &lt;em&gt;The Loneliest Polar Bear: A True Story of Survival and Peril on the Edge of a Warming World&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of the frantic effort to keep Nora alive and well, from the struggles of replicating polar bear milk to an hours-long surgery to fix a broken bone in her leg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbBRJh"&gt;But the book, an expansion of author Kale Williams’ &lt;a href="https://projects.oregonlive.com/projectnora/1-3/series"&gt;2017 series about Nora&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian &lt;/em&gt;/ OregonLive, goes beyond the life of a single bear. It details the political battles over the existence of climate change, debates about the ethics of zoos, and the already disastrous effects of global warming on native Alaskan villages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aj2u62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Williams about pulling all of these pieces together, writing about native communities, and the trouble of holding up one animal as a mascot for a complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPsOOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaES8TrTPQVViX8Hdi9AL4y03gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406406/9781984826336.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gULjVq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of very riveting and emotional moments packed into this book. So my first question for you is, did you cry at all when you were writing it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikxmi"&gt;Absolutely, on more than one occasion. Do you want just the writing part or the reporting part? Do you want travel frustrations or just emotional destitution? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzcu21"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about the emotional destitution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HMHsd"&gt;I think probably one of the hardest parts, this was actually after the manuscript was finished, and we were sort of in the editing phase and starting fact-checks. But last year, and this was hard for lots of reasons other than just the book itself, but I had been reading so much about climate change and talking to so many people who had been affected by it, and then the pandemic had hit. And then the wildfires in Oregon just brought this blanket of smoke into Portland that seemed to stick around forever. And that was really, I think, the low point for me because it kind of just brought home all these different themes of, you know, there was so much science denial going on around the pandemic, and it was just so reminiscent of all the stuff that I had sort of been reading about for the book and that I researched and writing about. And then to have that with the smoke on top of it was really just, at a lot of times felt like it was too much to bear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4oSF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book covers the history of polar bears and their habitats, the difficulty of raising them in captivity, the history of climate studies, the precarity of native populations in Alaska — and that’s all within the first 50 or so pages. So was it tough to weave all these different threads together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyD9br"&gt;It was, but I thought it was important to do so because I really wanted to place both humans and polar bears in their present situation by looking at how we got here, even on a geological timescale. We’ve all adapted to the world as it exists now, and we’ve been able to do so because it has changed on a geologic pace. But that is no longer the case. Obviously, the changes that we’re seeing now are much more rapid. So those adaptations that we’ve been able to do are not going to be enough for a lot longer. As the pace of change increases, then we are obviously going to need to adapt more quickly, which will be possible for some of us, those of us with means, but not possible for others, who aren’t able to escape wildfires in hotels or ice storms in shelters, or for polar bears who don’t have the advantage of being able to leave their habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QJtFPT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s sort of a “come for the cute polar bear cub, stay for the climate and indigenous justice” vibe to the book. So are you hoping people will be reeled in by Nora and then have larger takeaways from it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2TCg8"&gt;Yeah, it struck me that I was kind of doing the same thing that zoos do. You know, where obviously there’s a draw that these types of animals have, and you can sort of use that as a vehicle for another message, but I think her story remains central to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1Yij5"&gt;But I think, like I said before, I wanted to have this additional context of how people who live where polar bears do have learned to exist in the same type of harsh climate that seems inhospitable for those of us who live farther south. And you can’t really understand the problems that they’re facing without looking at the history of climate science and the rise of climate denial over the last 40 or 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDyF25"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this is your first book, your first time writing and being edited in such a large format. Were there any stories or interesting facts that didn’t make it into the book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eP26rc"&gt;Oh, man, there definitely were because we cut probably 25,000 words from the first draft to the final manuscript. I think that maybe is one of the areas where my editor helped the most was writing about the indigenous community up there. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: one of the main settings of the book is the village of Wales, Alaska.&lt;/em&gt;] I had a lot more on their history in some of the earlier drafts, including this whole long story about the first missionaries that went to Wales and the schools that they set up and how one of them ended up getting murdered by a couple of teenagers in the village, mostly because he was a supreme asshole to all of the people that lived there and treated them all with great disdain, was horribly racist, had no respect for any of their culture or traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsEb5e"&gt;That didn’t make it into the story. But I think that’s probably for the best. One of the things that I’ve been trying to pay close attention to is there’s a hashtag going around that was, I think it was like “OwnStories,” where people from these communities should be allowed to tell their own stories. And it’s not really my place to write the complete unabridged history of the village because there are lots of people who are more informed on that topic than I am. And for me to come in as an outsider and try to tell that story, it’s probably not my place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FenUIY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about polar bears being a really complicated mascot for climate change and also the trickiness of trying to figure out if an animal is happy. But there are also a lot of anecdotes about Nora’s caretakers connecting in a really emotional way with her. Do you think there are problems that come with ascribing human traits and feelings to animals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeMLqZ"&gt;I do, yeah. You know, obviously, anthropomorphizing has its drawbacks. I mean, we can project things onto animals that it’s impossible to know whether they’re actually experiencing. But I do think that there are plenty of ways to know whether an animal is doing well or not doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFeebl"&gt;There are dangers to ascribing human emotions to animals. But I think it’s also dangerous to think of them as, you know, big bags of meat that don’t have any sort of emotion at all. I don’t think it’s possible for us to necessarily understand how they experience that emotion. But I think it would be dangerous to think that they have no emotions whatsoever because then you are free to not care how well they’re doing. And you can treat them however you want. And I don’t think that’s right, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mlzpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll be honest, when I looked at the cover of the book, I felt a little like, “Oh man, here we go” because when I was a kid, I definitely grew up in the era where it felt like every day at school, people were saying, “We have to save the polar bears,” to the point at which polar bears became sort of an empty signifier and just barely have any meaning anymore. Do you feel like through the process of writing this book, your feelings about the polar bear as a mascot or about conservation efforts or how we talk about climate change, did they change throughout the writing of this book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEOkj0"&gt;I don’t know if they changed, but I certainly became more aware of the problems of having any sort of poster child or figurehead or mascot for a problem that’s as complex and multifaceted as climate change. I mean, anytime you simplify something as big as the climate crisis into “We need to save the polar bears,” something is going to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLdqLx"&gt;There are 19 populations that are around the Arctic. And some of them are certainly declining, others are stable, some are growing, others they have no idea about. When you put the polar bear up there as “We need to save this animal,” when, in fact, some of these populations are growing, then people who want to argue in bad faith can come back and say, “What do you mean we need to save the polar bears? We’ve got populations that are trending upwards. This is why all of climate science is fake.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6Kys7"&gt;When you have one mascot at the top of your flag, and everybody is supposed to rally around, it provides opportunities for people like that to come in and sort of cherry-pick and dismiss your whole argument. That being said, you know, if the polar bear is what it takes to inspire action in somebody, then I don’t really see the harm in that. It’s just a matter of trying to weigh those two things against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Area 120 incubator releases a powerful AI document scanner for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LkIYK9iwh9IhIfXkNrntStG9VQ=/107x0:1292x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048903/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.01.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2GBHa9"&gt;Google’s Area 120, an internal incubator program for experimental projects, is releasing a new app today called Stack that borrows the technology underlying the search giant’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai"&gt;powerful DocAI enterprise tool&lt;/a&gt; for document analysis. The end result is a consumer document scanner app for Android that Google says vastly improves over your average mobile scanner by auto-categorizing documents into the titular stacks and enabling full text search through the contents of the documents and not just the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bt1Ca"&gt;“I joined Google a couple of years ago when my education startup, Socratic, was acquired. At Socratic, we used Google’s computer vision and language understanding to make learning easier for high school students. I wondered if we could apply the same technologies to make organizing documents easier,” said Christopher Pedregal, the team lead on Stack, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FpXSKY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stack lets you search through the full text of scanned documents &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="muAoj3"&gt;Following the acquisition, Pedregal and his colleague Matthew Cowan joined Google’s Area 120, where they came up with an app that could use DocAI and its artificial intelligence technology to improve the process of scanning receipts, bills, and other important documents. The app uses Google’s biometric authentication on Android, so you can secure sensitive documents behind face or fingerprint scanning to unlock the software. It also automatically creates fields for scanned bills so you can fill in due dates and other important info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3GTMH"&gt;The app, like so many of Google’s experimental (and sometimes even not-so-experimental) efforts, is getting released in the hopes it catches on and not with any real concrete business model attached or a definite roadmap. Pedregal stresses that “it’s early days” for Stack, which means the app can “still get things wrong.” It also means it could, at a moment’s notice, get sent to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; — though, presumably, with the option to export your documents if that does happen at some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAX5gh"&gt;That said, it seems like a powerful alternative to a normal document scanner, and few companies are better than Google at understanding text and recognizing images. So it’s certainly worth a shot if you’re in the market for a better way to organize your real-world paper. &lt;/p&gt;
