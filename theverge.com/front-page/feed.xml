    <title>Shape-shifting storms like Ida are cities’ worst nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ida Batters Louisiana, Cutting Off All Power For New Orleans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n31TwvUnqZIiJOJzcMXWqytnVgU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794798/1234964690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;First responders prepare to launch rescue boats to transport residents out of floodwater left behind by Hurricane Ida in LaPlace, Louisiana, U.S., on Monday, Aug. 30, 2021 | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2mB73i"&gt;With less time to act as climate change churns up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08471-z"&gt;more rapidly intensifying storms&lt;/a&gt; like Hurricane Ida, coastal communities might have to rethink how they prepare for future storms. They could be forced to make tough decisions before a threat even fully materializes. Or they might take cues from how cities prepare for other types of disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dz4zJy"&gt;Ida &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647037/hurricane-ida-rapid-intensification-louisiana-storm"&gt;grew monstrous overnight&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a day, its wind speed jumped from 85 to 150 miles per hour, making it the fifth strongest storm to land in the mainland US. After Ida pummeled Louisiana for hours over the weekend, “virtually no one” had electricity in the state Monday morning, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1432340549940490248"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted to Twitter. Some places are under boil water advisories with water treatment systems out of commission. “We have tremendous damage to homes and businesses, we know that individuals are out there waiting to be rescued,” Edwards said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIYBGG"&gt;Ida’s rapid intensification outpaced authorities’ abilities to get everyone in the storm’s path out of the way. And shape-shifting storms like Ida make it more difficult for forecasters and officials to convey just how much risk residents face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6l5JC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Rapid intensification is a nightmare, maybe the worst nightmare”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xufHnV"&gt;“Rapid intensification is a nightmare, maybe the worst nightmare for emergency management and local state and federal government, because you don’t have a lot of time to prepare and it’s a moving target,” says John Knox, undergraduate coordinator of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igtu2G"&gt;New Orleans, which suffered a near-direct hit from Ida, only ordered mandatory evacuations of parts of the city outside of its protective levee system. Many residents hunkered down and braced for the impact of the hurricane. There wasn’t enough time to organize contraflow from the heart of the city, turning traffic so that it only heads out of New Orleans, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaIpx7"&gt;It might take 72 hours to evacuate the city before a hurricane makes landfall, according to one estimated &lt;a href="https://ready.nola.gov/plan/hurricane/"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; the city posted online. Ida strengthened from a depression to a tropical storm on &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2021/al09/al092021.update.08262116.shtml?"&gt;August 26th&lt;/a&gt;, just about three days before it made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5uHZB"&gt;“It takes longer to evacuate a city than it takes to build a destructive hurricane,” Kelly Hereid, director of catastrophe research &amp;amp; development at Liberty Mutual Insurance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KellyHereid/status/1431969128882053131"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. She points to lessons that could be learned from tsunami response when she says there might be only 10 to 30 minutes of warning in advance. In that scenario, some cities plan for “vertical evacuation.” Instead of leaving the area, people find shelter in structures built to withstand the catastrophe, she writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq509N"&gt;“Maybe planning large-scale emergency shelters to safely stay in place is part of the answer. Maybe it’s not,” Hereid writes. “But I know the answer is not: hope that *this time* we’ll have enough time to get everyone out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq2Mmr"&gt;Still, knowing that New Orleans was in the path of the storm was fair warning for officials, according to James Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia. How much power a storm will pack is still hard to assess because it requires peering into the inner mechanics of a storm, but forecasting &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; a storm will hit has gotten incredibly precise, thanks to better computer models.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxd9Gs"&gt;“I feel that there was time for public officials to do some more aggressive evacuations and to get people out of harm’s way,” Shepherd says, and it’s been “gut-wrenching” for him to watch the storm and its aftermath unfold. People just might need to be prepared for storms to pack a heavier punch than a simple category rating might suggest, he said. (Hurricanes are &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php"&gt;sorted into categories&lt;/a&gt; based on wind speed, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. Categories don’t take into account other dangers like rainfall or storm surge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDtVZq"&gt;“A lot of people go to bed saying, ‘A Category 2 or Category 3 storm, I can kind of deal with that.’ And then they wake up to a Category 4, borderline Category 5 storm,” says Shepherd. Some people might not respond as urgently to a storm with a lower category rating than they would for one with a higher rating, Shepherd says, even though there’s still “danger inherent in both scenarios.” Officials might consider lowering the bar for cities to act, Shepherd wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2021/08/30/do-officials-need-a-new-evacuation-playbook-for-rapidly-intensifying-hurricanes/?sh=69e5ca0458ec"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M6oyQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We all had a sense of dread”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dab6Hy"&gt;While Ida strengthened faster than other storms, the way it picked up steam was “textbook,” according to Knox. “For me and for my friends who are meteorologists, we all had a sense of dread because it seemed inevitable that it was going to rapidly intensify,” Knox said. They watched as warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico supercharged the storm, which feeds off heat energy. At the same time, there was a lack of wind shear to knock the growing hurricane down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sxmog"&gt;While that’s a familiar pattern, climate change &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-causing-more-rapid-intensification-of-atlantic-hurricanes/"&gt;speeds up the timeline&lt;/a&gt; and makes storms &lt;a href="https://news.sciencebrief.org/cyclones-mar2021/"&gt;more intense&lt;/a&gt; as it raises ocean temperatures. Disaster planners might need to act more preemptively if future storms continue to outpace existing response plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NiFDc"&gt;“You have to get people to act before it’s actually in existence, almost,” says Knox. “To mobilize the public in particular about something that doesn’t even exist yet — because [Ida] wasn’t a monster, until the morning of when it hit — that’s the really hard part,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHNqp8"&gt;There were other complicating factors in New Orleans this time around. COVID-19 added a layer of risk to mobilizing people en masse, and the city’s hospitals struggled to find beds in other parts of the state for their patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCJezX"&gt;There are also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28748777/"&gt;losses&lt;/a&gt; — measured in both lives and dollars — each time a community is forced to evacuate, which can, at times, take a bigger toll than the weather if the storm fizzles out. Evacuations for Hurricane Rita in 2005, for example, led to 100 of at least 119 deaths linked to the storm. Luckily, since forecasters have gotten much better at predicting where a storm will pass, there’s less risk of panicking people unnecessarily, according to Knox. But with storm intensity still somewhat of a wildcard and the peak of this year’s hurricane season still ahead, city leaders will have more hard decisions to face.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sets debut date for The Problem with Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JP8DGGuBmuuoZ5nblDg7Z1ekIYc=/13x0:1344x887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794793/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_11.26.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9KmDa"&gt;Apple’s upcoming show starring Jon Stewart, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, will debut on Apple TV Plus on September 30th, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;describes the show&lt;/a&gt; as a “multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most.” It will also have &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133"&gt;a companion podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which will “extend the conversation from each episode.” New episodes of the TV show will premiere every other week, while new episodes of the podcast will be released weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za6UJQ"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBMqejibrGg"&gt;a short teaser&lt;/a&gt; to promote the premiere date that features Stewart wondering, “what the hell happened to my face?” You can also listen to a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1&amp;amp;itscg=80085&amp;amp;itsct=pod_show_appletv_tpwjs"&gt;teaser of the podcast right now&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s only 15 seconds long and doesn’t give us a great idea of what the podcast will actually be like. In July, Stewart promoted the upcoming show with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;an odd video skewering the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt; that starred Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll have to tell Instagram your birthday to keep using the app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the process of adding your birthday to Instagram, as well as the messages that can appear." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUS2fMwkAsBSy-8G0c0RytzGE0E=/85x0:2128x1362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794031/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_9.55.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxqgAl"&gt;If you haven’t given Instagram your birthday, it’s &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/asking-people-for-their-birthdays"&gt;about to start asking for it a whole lot more&lt;/a&gt; — and it’ll eventually be required for you to use the app. Instagram started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995331/instagram-new-user-birthdate-account-create-age-younger-users"&gt;requiring that new users add their birthdates in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but if you had an older account, it was possible to skate by without providing that info. Now it seems that’ll become increasingly more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjbVc6"&gt;According to the press release, Instagram will ask you for your birthday when you open the app, if you haven't already added it to your profile. You’ll be able to ignore it, but only up to a certain point — eventually, Instagram says, you’ll have to add your birthday if you want to keep using the app. Instagram also says that if it doesn’t have your birthday, it’ll ask for it before showing you posts that are marked as sensitive. It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15035738/instagram-post-blurring-sensitive-content"&gt;blurring sensitive content for years&lt;/a&gt;, but now if you want to see it, your birthday will have to be on file with Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JzDKIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram says this is to help protect kids&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVXHJQOVKG_g1bja24N6r8hqm7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22815091/240595306_517898755937685_7019118104931207586_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram will also ask your age before showing you sensitive content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIkhzn"&gt;The company says these efforts are part of its work to make the platform safer for young people. In May, the company formally announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;working on a version of Instagram for people younger than 13&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that would obviously require the platform to know people’s ages. It’s also been working on other age protections, like making it so adults &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"&gt;couldn’t DM minors who weren’t following them&lt;/a&gt; or by making accounts for people &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-young-people-a-safer-more-private-experience"&gt;younger than 16 private by default&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram’s &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/2387676754836493"&gt;birthday support page&lt;/a&gt; also says it uses it to moderate ads. (For instance, people under 21 won’t get ads for alcohol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBXRUh"&gt;The company says, in the future, it’ll use its age detection AI to sniff out people who are lying about their ages. In July, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification/"&gt;Facebook had a blog post about this tech&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was analyzing comments on your birthday posts, such as “happy 21st” or “happy Quinceañera.” According to its press release, if someone says they’re above a certain age like 13 or 18, but the AI says otherwise, Instagram will have them verify their age using a variety of methods (though it doesn’t say exactly what this will look like). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VXjQoo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sometimes companies knowing your personal info can be a surprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOjZJN"&gt;Social networks have long asked you for your birthday, but having them required speaks to the growing need to make sure that kids are safe online and the feeling of invasiveness that can come with that. Snapchat users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608129/snapchat-born-astrology-information"&gt;recently got a taste of the strangeness&lt;/a&gt; that can come when social networks have information you might not remember handing over: they discovered that the app knew the time and location they were born because they had given the info to Snapchat’s astrological profile feature — and then seemingly forgot that they’d done so. For Instagram users, though, this likely won’t be an issue. It’s going to be hard to miss the birthday information requests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invest at PayPal could compete with Robinhood and Square’s retail stock trading </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95LhtFgjDZOk78w-1mo88pNXGkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793919/acastro_180410_1777_payapl_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlZLgc"&gt;The next platform to host a rush on stocks like GameStop and AMC could be PayPal, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/paypal-is-looking-to-launch-a-stock-trading-platform-for-its-customers.html"&gt;CNBC reports the company hired a brokerage industry vet to lead the effort&lt;/a&gt;. CNBC points out that Rich Hagen served as Ally Invest president after that company acquired a startup he co-founded called TradeKing, and now &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjhagen/"&gt;his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; lists him as the CEO of Invest at PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYeBM1"&gt;The meme stock trading action of the last year may have convinced PayPal it can’t let Robinhood or Square take over the market of retail investors who want to easily trade individual stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrBmPm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;Regulatory slaps on the wrist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;financial nihilism&lt;/a&gt; haven’t stalled activity on those apps. However, it may be a while before PayPal is a tool in the arsenal of r/WallStreetBets. PayPal’s CEO told CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the company has plans for additional financial services in the future, including investment capabilities, while at least one anonymous source told the outlet it’s “unlikely” the feature will be available this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DrLupo is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Off Court At The 2019 Australian Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veCQMEfVqzSvuTtWRbEluv9TszQ=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793846/1124891630.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt King / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cw4ys3"&gt;Streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo has signed a deal to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming, following in the footsteps of other well-known streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; in moving from Twitch to YouTube. Lupo’s first YouTube Gaming stream will take place on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64PoLQ"&gt;Lupo already has a sizable presence on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNF0LEQ2abMr0PAX3cfkAMg"&gt;with more than 1.7 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. But in switching to the Google-owned platform, he’s moving on from his large audience on Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drlupo"&gt;where he has 4.5 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIH1d"&gt;A Loaded PR representative declined to comment on the terms of Lupo’s YouTube Gaming deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;In December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lupo signed a deal with Twitch that was reported to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1204448185785208833"&gt;worth millions of dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;. The Amazon-owned streaming service acknowledged Lupo’s departure &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “we wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj1lqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a creator, a gamer and a father, you’re many things to many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrLupo&lt;/a&gt;, you’re someone who works hard to put good into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pkUCoX1dWe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pkUCoX1dWe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSDTjy"&gt;While big-name streamers aren’t signing splashy exclusivity deals quite as often as they used to in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ defection from Twitch to Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, that’s likely in part because Mixer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down by Microsoft in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the potential number of places to go is one platform fewer. (Blevins, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430767/ninja-twitch-homecoming-return-mixer-shroud"&gt;has returned to streaming exclusively on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V60daE"&gt;Both Dunlop and Hofstetter have seen success since moving exclusively to YouTube. However, Twitch sees vastly more hours watched than both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming combined, making up nearly 75 percent of total hours watched across all three platforms in the first quarter of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;Streamlabs report&lt;/a&gt;. That means Lupo may not see as much viewership on YouTube Gaming as he does on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuuqmiqAdW7tPWqmcx5C6neInFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814729/1_4lFFUZbSZuCWgetM2PbBng.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QByCTJ"&gt;But in signing this exclusivity deal, it seems Lupo sees opportunity with Google’s platform. And in a statement, he suggests the platform will also help him as he “expand[s] my brand through other entertainment initiatives,” so perhaps there’s more that YouTube is offering Lupo we just aren’t aware of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LdCB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 30th, 1:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children who take a mix of in-person and online classes. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Distance learners can still run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Zoom will be a large part of university life this semester: many kids will be attending virtual classes, while others will still be meeting with clubs, study groups, and professors as well as hanging out with friends online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple buys classical music streaming service Primephonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQCZ9Gr0fjFTQSuVqmTBjYhnLmA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793751/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZMern"&gt;Apple Music is pushing more extensively into classical music. Today, Apple announced that it has acquired &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;Primephonic&lt;/a&gt;, a service that specializes in streaming the classical genre, and will incorporate the app’s functionality and playlists into Apple Music. The result will be “a significantly improved classical music experience,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648604%2Fapple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a standalone Apple Music classical app coming sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBTHxN"&gt;Effective immediately, Primephonic is no longer accepting new customers, and the service as it exists today will shut down on September 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X85KIJ"&gt;Apple says Primephonic’s playlists and “exclusive audio content” will be first to be integrated into Apple Music. Down the line, it’ll add “the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn9ZSb"&gt;In a show of how serious Apple is about appealing to classical fans, the company says “a dedicated classical music app” will launch next year that will use Primephonic’s “classical user interface that fans have grown to love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZrAiO"&gt;Primephonic launched three years ago, and its team says this deal is about scale and reaching more listeners. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;a note on its webpage&lt;/a&gt;. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JPDEw"&gt;According to Primephonic’s FAQ, customers with an active subscription will receive a prorated refund. They’ll also be getting a code to redeem six free months of Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfbxSn"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;my early review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, classical lends itself extremely well to Dolby Atmos mixes — so I’m looking forward to the service evolving into a better home for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple cares about privacy, unless you work at Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vkm8vk7K3TJmJbPOjZRKE5RhsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793705/acastro_210828_4732_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company has taken a strong stance on safeguarding its customers’ data — but some employees don’t believe it protects theirs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i72298"&gt;Jacob Preston was sitting down with his manager during his first week at Apple when he was told, with little fanfare, that he needed to link his personal Apple ID and work account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a66Mno"&gt;The request struck him as odd. Like anyone who owns an Apple product, Preston’s Apple ID was intimately tied to his personal data — it connected his devices to the company’s various services, including his iCloud backups. How could he be sure his personal messages and documents wouldn’t land on his work laptop? Still, he was too giddy about his new job as a firmware engineer to care. He went ahead and linked the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C692k"&gt;Three years later, when Preston handed in his resignation, the choice came back to haunt him. His manager told him to return his work laptop, and — per Apple protocol — said he shouldn’t wipe the computer’s hard drive. His initial worry had come to pass: his personal messages were on this work laptop, as were private documents concerning his taxes and a recent home loan. Preston pushed back, saying some of the files contained highly personal information and there was no reasonable way to make sure they were all removed from the laptop without wiping it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTFGIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DHpRb1"&gt;He was told the policy wasn’t negotiable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8jpj8"&gt;Preston’s story is part of a growing tension inside Apple, where some employees say the company isn’t doing enough to protect their personal privacy and, at times, actively seeks to invade it for security reasons. Employees have been asked to install software builds on their phones to test out new features prior to launch — only to find the builds expose their personal messages. Others have found that when testing new products like Apple’s Face ID, images are recorded every time they open their phones. “If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds,” says Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fATl5U"&gt;Apple employees also can’t use their work email addresses to sign up for iCloud accounts, so many use their personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw557J"&gt;The blurring of personal and work accounts has resulted in some unusual situations, including Gjøvik allegedly being forced to hand compromising photos of herself to Apple lawyers when her team became involved in an unrelated legal dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fNLD"&gt;Underpinning all of this is a stringent employment agreement that gives Apple the right to conduct extensive employee surveillance, including “physical, video, or electronic surveillance” as well as the ability to “search your workspace such as file cabinets, desks, and offices (even if locked), review phone records, or search any non-Apple property (such as backpacks, purses) on company premises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGA1QT"&gt;Apple also tells employees that they should have “no expectation of privacy when using &lt;em&gt;your or someone else’s personal devices for Apple business&lt;/em&gt;, when using Apple systems or networks, or when on Apple premises” (emphasis added). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXwTkm"&gt;Many employees have a choice between getting an Apple-owned phone or having the company pay for their phone plan. But one source tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that trying to maintain two phones can become impractical. In software engineering, certain employees are expected to participate in a “live-on” program that puts out daily builds with bug fixes. “You can’t have a successful live-on program without people treating these devices exactly the same as a personal phone,” the source says. “So a work device or a work account just won’t cut it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OHPENx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcIeVu"&gt;None of these policies are unique. Tech companies almost always have rules in place to search employees’ corporate devices, including personal devices used for work. It’s also common practice for tech companies to ask employees to test new software, which could potentially expose personal information. But Apple sets itself apart from other tech giants through its commitment to consumer privacy. As &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-initiative"&gt;Tim Cook said at the CPDP Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, businesses built on buying and selling user data, without the knowledge or consent of consumers, “[degrade] our fundamental right to privacy first, and our social fabric by consequence.” The lack of employee privacy has made the perceived hypocrisy particularly irksome to some workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAgJJd"&gt;Now, as employees begin to push back against a variety of Apple norms and rules, these policies are coming under the spotlight, raising the question of whether the company has done enough to safeguard personal employee data. It might seem like a company obsessed with secrecy would be sympathetic to its employees’ wishes to have confidential information of their own. But at Apple, secrecy requires the opposite: extensive knowledge, and control, over its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W0EPAn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fX9LEK"&gt;This is how it starts: a new Apple employee is told during onboarding that collaborating with their colleagues will require them to make extensive use of iCloud storage, and their manager offers a two terabyte upgrade. This will link their personal Apple ID to their work account — in fact, the instructions for accessing this upgrade explicitly say “you must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account.” The connection will give them access to collaborative apps like Pages and Numbers that they might need to do their jobs. (Apple employees who do not have a business need to collaborate do not go through this process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL0ABq"&gt;Employees &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pause during onboarding and say they want to create a new Apple ID specifically for work or use a different phone. But most do not — it seems a little paranoid, and the Apple instructions say to go ahead and use your personal account. What’s more, most Apple devices don’t support using multiple Apple IDs. To switch between iCloud accounts on an iPhone, you have to completely sign out of one ID and into another — a clunky, disruptive process. It is far easier culturally and technically to simply link personal and work accounts, which adds a new Apple Work folder to the employee’s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CYWXBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rsRVfM"&gt;In theory, this Apple Work folder is where all of the collaborative documents for employees are supposed to live in order to keep personal and work files separate. In practice, the owner of a document often forgets to store files in the work folder, and documents quickly become intermingled. In fact, when Apple employees create a document in, say, Pages, the app automatically enters the personal email address used for their Apple ID. “I asked my manager about it and it’s just sort of an issue everyone deals with,” Preston says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9yZ8"&gt;Employees can choose to not sync certain folders, like their photo libraries. But others, like messages, can be trickier. Apple adopted Slack in 2019, but some teams still use iMessage as a primary way to communicate, which makes opting out of a message sync nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cND06r"&gt;Over the past few weeks, employees have been discussing the difficulty of setting up different Apple IDs to keep work and personal files separate, noting that while it’s possible, there are significant technical hurdles. “I don’t understand why they didn’t create an Apple ID and iCloud account from our work email address during the onboarding process,” one employee said on Slack. “I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gb5oHV"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KX6B7I"&gt;Concerns about data privacy are not ubiquitous inside Apple. Many employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were aware the company gave itself extensive rights to search their data, but — for various reasons — weren’t overly worried about the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS4l18"&gt;“When I joined Apple, I personally expected it to be pretty invasive and took some serious steps to separate my work and personal life,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvat9x"&gt;For other employees, however, the mixing of personal and work data has already had real consequences. In 2018, the engineering team Ashley Gjøvik worked on was involved in a lawsuit. The case had nothing to do with Gjøvik personally, but because she’d worked on a project related to the litigation, Apple lawyers needed to collect documents from her phone and work computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMBbDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All data that has your face in it is good data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjR32s"&gt;Gjøvik asked the lawyers to confirm that they wouldn’t need to access her personal messages. She says her team discouraged the use of two phones; she used the same one for work and personal and, as a result, had private messages on her work device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWh2Gt"&gt;A member of the legal team responded that while the lawyers did not need to access Gjøvik’s photos, they did not want her to delete any messages. During an in-person meeting, Gjøvik says she told the lawyers the messages included nude photos she’d sent to a man she was dating — a sushi chef who lived in Hawaii. Surely, those weren’t relevant to the lawsuit. Could she delete them? She says the lawyers told her no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n70Td0"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JxFw4s"&gt;In 2017, Apple rolled out an app called Gobbler that would allow employees to test Face ID before it became available to customers. The process was routine — Apple often launched new features or apps on employees’ phones, then collected data on how the technology was used to make sure it was ready for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwqUgC"&gt;Gobbler was unique in that it was designed to test face unlock for iPhones and iPads. This meant that every time an employee picked up their phone, the device recorded a short video — hopefully of their face. They could then file “problem reports” on Radar, Apple’s bug tracking system, and include the videos if they found a glitch in the system. “All data that has your face in it is good data,” said an internal email about the project. After rumors of criticism,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple eventually changed the codename to “Glimmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pGlrWf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Zoe Apple Feature|103688" data-volume-uuid="580d2e156" data-volume-id="103688" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-412" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jV2FDY"&gt;Unlike other Apple features, Glimmer wasn’t automatically installed on employee phones. It required an informed consent form so employees would know what they were getting into. Still, for some people on engineering teams, participation was encouraged — even expected, according to two staff members. Once it was installed, some data that didn’t contain personally identifiable information would automatically upload to Radar, unless employees turned off this setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pznio"&gt;Apple was careful to instruct employees not to upload anything sensitive, confidential, or private. But it didn’t tell people what was happening with the hundreds of images they didn’t upload in Radar reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMLdGA"&gt;The reports themselves were also a cause for concern. When employees file Radar tickets, they include detailed information about the problems they are seeing. In 2019, Gjøvik filed a ticket about Apple’s photo search capabilities. “If I search for ‘infant’ in my photo library, it returns a selfie I took of myself in bed after laparoscopic surgery to treat my endometriosis,” she wrote, including four images in the ticket. The default sharing settings for the ticket included all of software engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o3fzws"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gprojb"&gt;Radar tickets also are not removable. Even when the tickets are closed, they remain searchable. In training, employees say they are told: “Radar is forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxerl"&gt;What’s more, when employees file Radar tickets, they are often asked to include diagnostic files, internally called “sysdiagnose” to give Apple more information about the problem. If they are filing a bug about iMessage, they might be asked to install a sysdiagnose profile that exposes their iMessages to the team tasked with fixing the issue. For employees using a live-on device, default settings can mean that, as they are filing a Radar ticket, a sysdiagnose profile is being automatically created in the background, sending data to Apple without the employee realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjiYsZ"&gt;When sysdiagnose profiles are not included, employees have been known to post memes calling out the omission. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/On4EnZwfGWeTJIUzgvtp5knMPOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814656/IMG_3D14F61845E9_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="apGDlX"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g3Kohu"&gt;Gjøvik is currently on administrative leave from Apple due to an ongoing investigation into claims she made about harassment and a hostile work environment. If she leaves the company, she’ll likely face the same conundrum as Jacob Preston, related to the mixing of her personal and work files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujrz0L"&gt;Employees likely wouldn’t care too much about this were it not for another Apple rule that bars them from wiping their devices when they leave the company. If they do, they’ll be in direct violation of their employment agreement, leaving them vulnerable to legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6d7p"&gt;After Preston gave notice, he received a checklist from his manager that explicitly said: “Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wipe or factory reset any Apple owned units (such as laptops, Mac, ipads, and iPhones).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1N0xn"&gt;“Before joining Apple I had a lot of respect for the company,” Preston says. “They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously. But then they go and have these policies that are hypocritical and go against their stated values. It’s sort of hard to reconcile. It’s like now that I’m leaving, my privacy isn’t a concern anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6Tj11j"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s parent company acquires VR headset maker Pico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pico Neo 3 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDtcCeS1spNipnFMdje8N7VedwA=/0x0:940x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793264/m_carousel_neo3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tmccad"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is acquiring Chinese virtual reality headset maker Pico. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-acquires-pico-and-takes-first-step-into-virtual-reality.html"&gt;CNBC confirmed the news&lt;/a&gt; today after it was rumored last week and verified by Chinese &lt;a href="https://news.nweon.com/88799"&gt;publication &lt;em&gt;Nweon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ByteDance told CNBC in a statement that Pico’s “comprehensive suite of software and hardware technologies, as well as the talent and deep expertise of the team, will support both our entry to the VR space and long-term investment in this emerging field,” saying it was “optimistic about the future of VR and its alignment with our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti8Bih"&gt;Pico is known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511680/pico-neo-vr-headset-controller-specs-hands-on"&gt;Neo lineup&lt;/a&gt; of standalone virtual reality headsets, most recently the &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;Pico Neo 3&lt;/a&gt;. It caters to &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;both consumer and professional&lt;/a&gt; customers, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210630005150/en/Facebook-Leads-the-VR-Headset-Market-in-Q1-2021-But-Theres-Plenty-of-Room-for-Others-According-to-IDC"&gt;a June IDC report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that Pico is the third largest maker of VR headsets, following Facebook subsidiary Oculus and Chinese company DPVR. While the consumer-focused Neo 3 launched exclusively in Asia, Pico is slowly expanding its market, with the &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/pico-neo-3-pro-eye-release-date-price/"&gt;business-ready Neo 3 Pro and Neo 3 Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt; set for a North American and European release as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTVq9x"&gt;ByteDance is known primarily as a social app company, thanks to global juggernaut TikTok and China-based Douyin. As CNBC notes, however, it also acquired the major &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/bytedance-takes-on-tencent-with-major-gaming-studio-acquisition.html"&gt;mobile games studio Moonton&lt;/a&gt; in March. It’s got experience releasing hardware as well, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947721/tiktok-bytedance-smartisan-jianguo-pro-3-release-date-china-price-features"&gt;launched a China-exclusive mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; called the Jianguo Pro 3 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uURBy"&gt;The Pico acquisition seems unlikely to mix with ByteDance’s TikTok service in the near future. It’s also not clear how the acquisition might affect Pico’s rollout plans. The company has so far avoided direct competition with Oculus — which dominates the global VR market but doesn’t operate within China. But with Facebook intensifying its push into VR, Apple reportedly preparing to enter the market, and Sony preparing a follow-up to its PlayStation VR headset, ByteDance is signaling that it’s also interested in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric robotaxis may not be the climate solution we were led to believe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM Robot Car Company Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWAwg9JNctrOYzYxtqpiTx8W4yY=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793226/1189070698.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n51fWE"&gt;For years, we’ve been told that electric autonomous taxis can help fight climate change by reducing air pollution. But new research from Harvard Law School suggests these supposedly “zero emissions” vehicles could actually exacerbate many of the problems we are facing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hoNOf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd9/pdf"&gt;A new study led by Ashley Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, concluded that fleets of electric autonomous taxis could “dramatically increase energy consumption and emissions that contribute to climate change — not reduce them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vt6sL"&gt;“While electric vehicles themselves have lower emissions than traditional gasoline-powered ones, our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions,” Nunes said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y5Ly7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNNs5M"&gt;Transportation is one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with the most significant share coming from light-duty vehicles, personal cars, vans, trucks, and SUVs. Replacing some of those trips with electric autonomous vehicles operating as part of a ride-hailing fleet could help offset some of those emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neRL2b"&gt;But by studying data from San Francisco, Nunes’ team found that “ubiquitous electric robocabs might erase those energy savings” by increasing demand for rides while also decreasing ride-pooling or carpooling, largely due to their public perception as easy, cheap, and eco-friendly. In other words, more people would be using these cars to get around who might not have otherwise have done so, thanks to their availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMX9st"&gt;“Our work showed that transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed, and an increase in the number of Americans who choose to give up sharing rides in favor of using electric robocabs for single occupant trips,” says Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uzqcza"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OHzEHU"&gt;The study cast doubt on assertions from the AV industry that the advent of electric autonomous vehicles would be a net positive for the environment. Kyle Vogt, co-founder, president, and chief technology officer at Cruise, said as much during an event hosted by the National Federation of the Blind back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWtw1d"&gt;“I know AVs will change the way we live and move: they’ll save lives, improve accessibility, reduce emissions and air pollution, and give people back the most important resources: their time and their freedom to go where they want to go when they want to go,” Vogt said, &lt;a href="https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm19/bm1909/bm190906.htm"&gt;according to the transcript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPxV51"&gt;Cruise often touts its commitment to an all-electric fleet — the company only uses battery-powered Chevy Bolts provided by its financial backer, General Motors — as a key factor that distinguishes it from other AV operators. Most other self-driving car companies use a mix of gas-powered, hybrid, and electric vehicles to comprise their fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpxjmU"&gt;The media has also helped push the idea that electric robotaxis would counteract the effects of climate change, with overly speculative headlines like “&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/26/ai-weekly-how-self-driving-cars-could-reduce-emissions-eliminate-parking-spots-and-add-1-3-trillion-to-the-u-s-economy/"&gt;How self-driving cars could reduce emissions, eliminate parking spots, and add $1.3 trillion to the US economy&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/ucdavis/driverless-cars-could-be-a-solution-to-climate-change/"&gt;Driverless cars could be a solution to climate change — but two major things have to happen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhBNzf"&gt;Some AV operators are aware of the conundrum that could arise from the spread of electric robotaxis. Cruise, for example, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;building a purpose-built autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; designed primarily for shared rides. “It’s designed to be comfortable if it’s shared, but if it’s just you, you’ve got so much space in here you can really like stretch out,” Vogt told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HQQqW"&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future, the Harvard team concluded. Rather than handing out tax breaks to people who buy EVs, policymakers should consider financial incentives or discounts for people willing to carpool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4R0wOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amkvnO"&gt;Electric robotaxis would have to be more than “50 percent cleaner than today’s electric cars to reduce emissions, given their anticipated increase in trips,” they said. Cleaning up the electrical grid by eliminating the use of coal and polluting energy sources is another solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czvl5I"&gt;Of course, eliminating the need for car trips altogether by promoting the use of mass transit — or for shorter trips, walking and biking — is the best way to reduce an individual’s overall vehicle miles traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XuHFS"&gt;Nunes’ study is the latest to poke holes in “zero emissions” claims by the tech and auto industry. A University of Michigan study in 2018 found the shift toward autonomy could &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b04576"&gt;raise (rather than reduce) a vehicle’s energy demands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11116-018-9937-9"&gt;Another research paper&lt;/a&gt; looked at the behavior of households that were offered a free chauffeur service for 60 hours over a seven-day period, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756945/uber-lyft-tnc-vmt-traffic-congestion-study-fehr-peers"&gt;akin to a ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; or a future driverless car. The study participants’ vehicle miles traveled rose by about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
