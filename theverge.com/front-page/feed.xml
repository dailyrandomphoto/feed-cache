    <title>Ring’s Halloween doorbell Chimes return and new spooky quick replies arrive</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring brings spooky ringtones to its video doorbells in time for Halloween.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eqLTYk"&gt;Following in the now annual tradition of the spooky smart home, Ring has released its seasonal ding dongs. In honor of the festive season, you can turn your Ring Video Doorbell’s interior Chime’s tone to a screeching cat, a creaky door, or my personal favorite, the creepy laugh, for the month of October. There are a handful of other scary tones also, nine in total, which is eight more than Google is offering on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699288/google-nest-doorbell-spooky-halloween-holiday-ringtones"&gt;its Nest doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcnF2R"&gt;To up the spooky ante this year, Ring has a new trick as an extra treat: a selection of Halloween-themed Quick Replies, a free feature that lets your doorbell answer for you. Now, when a visitor presses the Ring buzzer, it can talk back to them with these additions to the standard preset responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76uMTC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Tell us what brings you here...or we’ll put a spell on you!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXSsU5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Boo! Leave us a message if you dare [evil laugh].”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBcwoU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just a minute! Feel free to park your broom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJon8p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Please leave the package (and any hocus pocus) outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCDGP"&gt;Personally, I’d like one that says, “All the candy is gone, move along now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGD3l9"&gt;Billed by Ring as the busiest doorbell day of the year, Halloween is definitely a day when a video doorbell shines. I’ve had hours of fun scaring trick or treaters — or UPS delivery drivers — in years past when the seasonal tones roll around. (Pro tip: plug the Chime in right by the front door, as the ringtone on the doorbell itself doesn’t change). Although, sadly, it seems the scare factor is wearing off somewhat as doorbell cameras become more ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUTMs1"&gt;However, the new Quick Replies come right from the doorbell itself, not through the Ring Chime, so they might have a bit more of fright factor. These launched today (the ringtones arrived in mid-September) and will be replaced by winter holiday-themed options at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lHyXvLqn6UB8p833xv0ibpATl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900187/Ring_Video_Doorbell_4_with_Halloween_Faceplate_Lifestyle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring wants to help you decorate your front door this season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kZupAF"&gt;The Quick Replies feature is available on all Ring doorbells other than the base model Ring Video Doorbell Wired. If you have a Ring Protect Plan, you can use it as an answering machine and view the recorded video and audio of the visitor in the app, but you don’t need a subscription for the replies themselves. You set up Quick Replies in the Ring App, which is also where you can change the ringtone on your Chime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqF033"&gt;If you (or your neighborhood) really get into the Halloween spirit, Ring is also releasing seasonal faceplates for the Ring Video Doorbell 2, 3, 3 Plus, and 4, which cost $14.99 each from the &lt;a href="http://Ring.com"&gt;Ring.com&lt;/a&gt; store. Choose from a spooky design with bats and spiderwebs, or opt for something less scary and more festive and fun, like pumpkins and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2hqns"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufVdtjvxagzzrODMeyYf-yQ1-Pg=/315x0:1728x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949303/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.06.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOH1L8"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;something like Facebook drops off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, there are massive knock-on effects. For example, a website that’s meant to tell you if services are down, called Is It Down Right Now, is struggling mightily under the load of people trying to see Instagram’s status. Cloudflare, a company that runs a DNS service (DNS acts like a map for your web browser when it’s trying to find a website and is also the likely culprit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;when it comes to major outages&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?s=20"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s had to mobilize extra resources to keep up with the traffic of people trying to load Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp) over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpJzYZ"&gt;If you need to check if other sites are down, you do still have options. There’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;the venerable DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com"&gt;Down for Everyone or Just Me&lt;/a&gt; (DFEOJM informed me that it’s not just me having issues with Is It Down). I’m going to need all of you to decide between yourselves how to split up traffic between these two sites, so we don’t crash them too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZ91u_y2HjJ9H1v0YamzWdO_0Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900268/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.11.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a little awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="opQCm8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now, here's the fun part. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; runs a free DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1, and lots of people use it. So Facebook etc. are down... guess what happens? People keep retrying. Software keeps retrying. We get hit by a massive flood of DNS traffic asking for &lt;a href="https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6"&gt;https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wiY7iP"&gt;In the hacking world, there’s something called a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, where attackers basically pool together tons of computing resources and use them to generate tons of traffic to a website. If they’ve got enough power, the website will go down — and that’s very likely what’s happened with Is It Down Right Now, except instead of malicious hackers, it’s half the internet accidentally overwhelming the service through sheer combined will. I guess that’s what happens when &lt;a href="https://status.fb.com"&gt;Facebook’s status page&lt;/a&gt; goes down along with the rest of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3SNbY"&gt;PS: there’s one funny side effect that comes from many people basically only using their internet connections for Facebook — many ISPs and cellular providers, like &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and more, have also been reported as down, even though their services seem to be working fine. But because people can’t access Facebook, they may assume the problem is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin’s ideas to mimic SpaceX sound pretty brutal for employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eJj6J9eNJHVJinQExP_BOyhUKE=/193x0:2808x1743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949275/blue_origin_first_human_flight_l0_new_shepard_launch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPrT5n"&gt;In an attempt to recreate SpaceX’s success, executives at spaceflight venture Blue Origin once praised the rival company’s “burnout” culture as a working labor strategy, with some managers arguing that Blue Origin needs to “get more” out of employees and encourage them to come in on the weekends. The grueling working strategies were summed up in a 2018 memo compiled by Blue Origin executives, a copy of which was viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oPgPy"&gt;Parts of the memo were quoted in &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;an alarming Lioness essay published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, which alleged a sexist and unsafe work culture at Blue Origin, founded by former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The essay was written by Alexandra Abrams, the former head of employee communications at Blue Origin, along with 20 present and past employees at the company. She detailed former executives who spoke in demeaning ways to women, as well as one who got fired after groping a female employee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;The essay also described a retaliatory culture&lt;/a&gt;, one in which people are too scared to speak up about safety issues for fear of losing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBoyTw"&gt;“In our experience, Blue Origin’s culture sits on a foundation that ignores the plight of our planet, turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs,” Abrams wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MOSPr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The lack of effort over weekends to meet deadlines is not culture I am accustomed to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSGAmi"&gt;Abrams also described company executives as being impatient with slipping schedules, which resulted in them trying to find ways squeeze more productivity out of their employees. She cited the 2018 memo as an example of how Blue Origin hoped to be more aggressive like its competitor SpaceX. Executives created the memo after attending a briefing with Avascent, a strategy and management consultant. In the document, they summarized some of their biggest takeaways from the meeting, while highlighting some of the labor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concepts that SpaceX employs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IvK3x"&gt;“Very long hours are expected,” the memo says of SpaceX’s culture. “People are expected to work on vacations or not take them. Burnout is part of their labor strategy. It’s one reason they [sic] workforce tends to be on the younger side. They hired new grads eager to learn and performance [sic] and purposely burn them out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEhOmI"&gt;A Blue Origin executive later gives his advice on how Blue Origin should change, based on how SpaceX runs its business. “We need to get more out of our employees,” Gregory “Ray J” Johnson, a former astronaut and former Blue Origin manager, wrote. “The lack of effort over weekends to meet deadlines is not culture I am accustomed to in an operations outfit. I realize that development is somewhat different but regardless SpaceX expects and gets more out of their employees. It is a privilege to be a part of history. We are not necessarily slacking by any means but we may be less focused.” Elsewhere in the memo, it states that “Blue is a ghost town on weekends.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viewer-3cn8c"&gt;Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the company did release a statement when the essay was first published. “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said. “We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct. We stand by our safety record and believe that New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDoeAO"&gt;The Blue Origin memo seems to claim that SpaceX succeeds by “selling inspiration and guiding vision to employees,” thanks to strong branding and an active social media presence. And since these workers are hired at the beginning of their careers, they are “driven to work long hours,” with peer pressure a driving factor behind their schedules. As a result, SpaceX achieves “low cost relative to work output” and “high attrition with early burnout.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNvKHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Blue is a ghost town on weekends.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYT03W"&gt;“They have a workforce aligned to accomplish the work for the least cost: utilization of early career engineers, who work 80 hours for below market compensation means they can produce drawings at a fast and cost effective pace,” Erik Sallee, a former corporate comptroller at Blue Origin, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV4vQo"&gt;Another strategy the memo cites is that SpaceX actively maintains a “bottom 10 percent” of its workforce, all of whom are automatically put on performance improvement plans or PIP. Other companies have also employed similar tactics, including Amazon, another company founded by Jeff Bezos. But the memo claims that SpaceX automatically lets go of the bottom 10 percent of its workforce each year “ensuring they have a clear path to a continually improving workforce,” Sallee wrote. The idea that companies should fire the 10 percent lowest performing employees was &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/paul-b-brown/should-you-fire-10-of-your-employees-every-year.html"&gt;famously championed by Jack Welch&lt;/a&gt;, the former CEO and chairman of General Electric. In January 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179258/spacex-layoffs-10-percent-work-force-dragon-capsule-satellite-internet-starship"&gt;SpaceX did announce that it was laying off 10 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; that year. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckIsGf"&gt;In response to this tactic, Jason Davis, a vice president of enterprise technology at Blue Origin, wrote that he didn’t necessarily want to put the bottom 10 percent of employees on automatic PIPs, but that “as an organization we need to be more forward/direct about our employee performance overall.” He also argued that he thinks “Blue is kind of lazy compared to SpaceX.” Another executive agreed that Blue needs to better communicate an expectation that employees work more than 40 hours a week. “I’m not advocating 80 hours a week, but we won’t get [New] Shepard to [first human flight] [New] Glenn to orbit or Engines delivered to ULA on 40 per week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJGIMB"&gt;Elsewhere, the memo cites other examples for SpaceX’s success, such as the fact that the company is mostly vertically integrated, practices iterative design, and designs its vehicles with lowering cost as a significant motivator. The executives seemed to agree that trending in these directions could make Blue Origin more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOkSWO"&gt;Abrams claims the primary motivation for writing the essay was concerns over Blue Origin’s vehicles being safe, given the structural problems within the company and how overworked the employees are. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle,” she wrote. “And no wonder—we have all seen how often teams are stretched beyond reasonable limits.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There are a just a few noteworthy features in this design-focused update&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RFWcqP"&gt;The most exciting thing about a big Android update is getting to try all of the new show-stopping features that’ll change the way you’ll use your phone. Android 12, which releases in a few weeks on Pixel phones (3 and up) and just a select few other devices later this year, is interesting because, well, it doesn’t have a bunch of those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNR8tG"&gt;I’ve been using Android 12 on the Pixel 3 since the first developer preview, and on the Pixel 4A 5G more recently during the latest release candidate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22473033"&gt;Google announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it released the Android 12 source on Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but instead of releasing it broadly as it has in years past, Pixel owners will need to wait a few more weeks. A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s “putting the finishing touches on a special release with Pixel-exclusive and Pixel-first experiences on Android 12.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PpWGW"&gt;For the most part, it’s still Android. You can easily get by on the new update without using the smattering of new features that Google buried in the settings, though it’s worth seeking out a few of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP2yYF"&gt;The most obvious change, which is also the biggest incentive for most people to download Android 12, is Google’s new Material You design. The company says it’s the biggest design change in Android’s history. I agree that it’s significant, since it basically makes stock Android look like a really good custom launcher. There’s more color and more fun shapes throughout, and weirdest of all, widgets are officially a thing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syqR5csqL5OvtnWiQlcg836QUgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899749/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s design can look as loud or subdued as you’d like, and it doesn’t force you to use widgets if you don’t want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4D1oA-9Sk5eto1gI4hZ7wE68xUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899745/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sun-shaped clock is probably the best widget Google has created yet. Let’s hope it has more up its sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nNSmS3"&gt;The core design improvements in Android 12 further smooth over some of the operating system’s edges — quite literally. The animations you’ll see when you power on your device, turn it off, or plug in a charger all look refined and fluid. Notification pop-ups, items in the pull-down quick settings menu, the volume interface, and more have nice, rounded edges, nesting elegantly within the equally rounded corners of the displays on Pixel phones. In some cases, though, the refreshed design comes at the cost of information density. Power users might feel like they’re using a Fisher Price phone, particularly when it comes to how the pull-down menu looks, but others may not mind as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ1HsW"&gt;I’d say that the fit and finish of Android 12 is more polished than any other version at launch, except for a rather annoying bug with its at-a-glance widget at the top of the homescreen, which wouldn’t display the weather or other important calendar or traffic info during the beta, nor can it be fully turned off. Its menu had toggle switches with no descriptions next to them, and it was an eyesore. If Google fixes this in the final release, we’ll note that in the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="06DIkP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10788908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5Zou"&gt;Google’s goal with Material You is to unify the look of all of its disparate devices, including smart displays, phones, and anything else running Google software that has a screen. But for Android 12, the big visual overhaul is about giving you just a little more flexibility in making your phone feel more like your own. Leading the charge are many of Google’s long-forgotten widgets that have received a glow-up for Android 12. In case you are just now waking up after a five-year slumber, widgets are cool again, and even iOS has them. Having a colorful, sun-shaped clock and the “Your memories’’ widget from Google Photos on my homescreen looks great, and I’m really eager to see if more companies than just Google think it’s worth investing in making or updating widgets. Though I’ll admit, I’m a little scared to hold my breath here. A lot of the widgets, particularly third-party media players, still look like they haven’t gotten attention for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40KuPY"&gt;But even before we know if there will eventually be a rush of widgets vying for a spot on my homescreen, I think Google missed the obvious opportunity to adapt Apple’s widget stacks feature in iOS. Single-purpose widgets take up a lot of precious space, and with something like widget stacks, which lets you stack two or more widgets on top of each other and scroll through them as needed, it’d be possible to have both a functional homescreen and a good-looking one. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi26o0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;Android 11&lt;/a&gt; introduced support for custom themes, letting you adjust the font type, app icon shape, and color scheme. Android 12 has pared down the customization to focus just on what color you want to appear on some of the menus, buttons, widgets, and tiles on the quick settings pull-down menu, including the native media player seen within the notifications pane. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8pOA7CobN5Kt2tkQIjgSrHw6jQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899747/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wallpapers &amp;amp; style menu gives you a few more customization options in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0NJXI"&gt;You’ll find the “wallpapers &amp;amp; style” option by long-pressing on the homescreen, and from there you can choose a color from a palette that’s automatically generated from your wallpaper. I really love this. Though, if you just want to keep it simple, you can pick from one of four pastels that look different depending on whether you have light or dark mode activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUVdv8"&gt;Another small but nifty feature in this setting is “Themed Icons,” which attempts to dip all of your app icons in your preferred color for a more consistent look. In practice, many of Google’s apps played nicely with this feature during the beta, but not a single third-party app that I had installed did. Perhaps it’s intentional on Google’s part, opting to let non-Google apps pop with more color on your homescreen. Or maybe it’s that app makers may not want to voluntarily make their app icons less identifiable at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eo3td"&gt;Before I get to some of the other improvements that I’m glad to have in Android 12, I need to mention that I haven’t gotten over Google’s omission of the power menu, one of Android 11’s most well-executed ideas. By holding the power button, it used to let you easily access your Google Pay wallet, smart home gadgets, and power settings, all from one screen. Now, holding the power button will trigger the Google Assistant. You’ll find smart home device toggles and Google Pay relocated to the bottom right and left corners of the lock screen, mimicking the respective locations of the flashlight and camera buttons on iPhones. Alternatively, you can find them in the quick settings pull-down, if that’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 11 nailed the now-defunct power menu (seen here).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMjEC4sw9caaDsSQzGZbB2kRkSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899842/android12gp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those same controls have been relocated to the bottom corners of the Android 12 lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGoPRF"&gt;You may not lament the power menu’s disappearance, but I think the big issue is that Google keeps changing how you access these increasingly vital functions. It’d just be great if Google could try to improve on its ideas without completely ditching them after one iteration of Android. It still lets people choose whether they want to experience Android with or without gestures, so why not also let them choose where they want to access mobile payments and smart home device controls? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmzdL9qkWrGlZ6oQ_6FXsZhTrSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899801/android12screens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the broken At a Glance homescreen widget, the new-look pull-down menu, and the new scrolling screenshot feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L6gx6H"&gt;Outside of that, there are several tweaks that are additive to the Android experience, even if Apple or other Android OEMs beat Google to the punch. Regardless, it’s great that Google &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;added scrolling screenshots to the Pixel’s feature set. This lets you take screen grabs that span further down the page. Android 12 also debuts indicators that appear at the top of your phone when the camera or microphone are in use, just like the feature that appeared in iOS 14. There are even new quick setting tiles you can add to quickly be able to turn off the camera and / or microphone on the system level. Those tiles are going to get a lot of use from people, I expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmecPC"&gt;Also, when an app asks for your location, you can now specify in most cases whether you want to give the app approximate or precise location info, like in iOS. This year’s Android update also brings a one-handed mode that’s identical to Apple’s. Once it’s active within the gestures menu, just swipe your finger down on the bottom edge of the display to pull things within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new privacy dashboard is accessible within the system settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NweM3wh1-Ci0u6lLU4AqYibn2iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899753/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quick Tap feature was available on the Pixel 4A that I tested, but not the Pixel 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMelXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;Android 12’s new Privacy Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is worth checking out, too, since it keeps tabs on how often your apps are pinging for your location, requesting to access your call logs, or are tapping into your camera and microphone. Even if this isn’t something that you plan on monitoring often, it’s great that Google built more transparency than ever into the OS, showing what kind of access your apps have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kGs6Da"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10788875"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2VMbZ"&gt;If that didn’t seem to you like an overwhelming amount of features, you’re right. As my colleague Chaim Gartenberg mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in this year’s iOS 15 review&lt;/a&gt;, these big updates are becoming smaller and subtler. After more than a decade of polish, these operating systems are no longer in need of vast reworkings every calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXi0CA89bAI0Kd6NcEmEITEWEnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899854/Screenshot_20211004_102048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How some games will look with the Game dashboard feature switched on. It gives you the option to take screenshots, record footage, toggle do not disturb, as well as see frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RpauYp"&gt;More features will come, though. Google will probably follow up with a few “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002753/pixel-feature-drop-updates-robocall-screening-portrait-mode-duo-video-call"&gt;feature drops&lt;/a&gt;’’ in 2022. And, if they’re anything like previous ones, they’ll make owning a Pixel phone feel like an even more rewarding experience. Looking forward, there are rumors that Android 12.1 might bring more changes, particularly, multitasking improvements for foldable phones, a sector that Google itself may be joining soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdo6XeiVBGQ2Q8mFGhn7DCxrU5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899751/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the stock wallpapers look incredible when used with the new Material You widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ltViEPolTZLhUVKceL2-RgE_Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899748/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s possible to go with a more understated look, too, with icon colors to match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJcpzy"&gt;In reviewing a new Android update, I thought about how these changes and features will impact all Android phones. But the thing is, right now Android 12 is really only good news for Pixel users, and it might be that way for a while. This update is rolling out today to the Pixel 3 and up, and we’ll be adding the other manufacturers offering support once Google confirms it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZougoE"&gt;According to this &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;, Google says Android 12 is coming to “Pixel in the next few weeks and Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later this year.” We’ll update this review once Google shares specifics on the models that will receive Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8ODL"&gt;Each of those phones use their own custom Android wrapper with its own design ID. So, while many of Android 12’s new features should make the jump, it’s possible that Google’s big Material You design push may not appear, at least with the same amount of customization that you’d find on Pixel, on every other phone that gets the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="QCQlln"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10789089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflhjZyYlhhq9_kTXsLfZ2Pl4HE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899754/cfaulkner_211004_4791_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, Google is using more of the Pixel’s always-on display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xbUkpj"&gt;Samsung is a big manufacturer missing from the list of devices getting Android 12 today. Though, it has already committed to bringing the software to its Galaxy S21 lineup from earlier this year in the form of its OneUI 4 update. A hands-on with the beta software &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-ui-4-beta-features-overview/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that Samsung’s take on Android 12 doesn’t seem to have the same pizzazz as Google’s treatment on Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kcGiJI"&gt;Android 12 isn’t an update that’s trying to change how you use your phone — not that it needed to be. Instead of just tacking on dozens of new features, Google just wanted to shake things up in the design department for the sake of it. It’s an upheaval of some of Android’s smallest details. It amounts to a more customizable experience, which in turn lets your phone look and feel more unique. If that gets you excited, you probably won’t regret installing. But I wouldn’t buy a Pixel just to experience Android 12. And if you can’t get the update today, I wouldn’t fret too much until more features are added.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will be coming to Pixel phones in the ‘next few weeks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyVdnaxjrbo9gsgm76mcH5LuIVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949219/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAmjlA"&gt;Google’s latest major Android update, Android 12, isn’t available to the general public just yet, but it’s getting closer. The company wrote on its &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers site&lt;/a&gt; that it pushed the source to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is “officially” releasing the update. Despite Android 12 being technically available, you won’t find it appearing as an update on your Pixel phone for the “next few weeks,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QyOrt"&gt;When it does launch, it’ll come to the Pixel 3, Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; phones (wow, Google sure makes a lot of these now). It’s the software that you’ll see on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; when those launch later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaC2XP"&gt;According to Google, it’ll also come to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7JaI"&gt;In case you’re curious what’s what with Android 12, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472761"&gt;I’ve got a review of the software&lt;/a&gt;, which I tested extensively on both a Pixel 3 and Pixel 4A 5G. It’s an update that is mostly focused on tweaking the way Android looks with Google’s new Material You design language. There are other features worth trying, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;including a new privacy dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that offers up more transparency on how your apps access your location, microphone, and camera, but overall, it’s not an update that aims to drastically alter how you use your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5vAPn"&gt;If you need an extra hand with downloading and installing the update when it comes, we’ll be putting up a step-by-step guide for doing that on your Pixel or other supported phone, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s entire network of services suddenly went offline. On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; is flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely tells us that something went wrong. The problem also appears to be affecting its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users can load games they already have installed and the browser works, but social features or installing new games does not. The outage is thorough enough that it’s affecting Workplace from Facebook customers and, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1445058298034614278?s=21"&gt;according to Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s internal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgO9qf"&gt;There’s no word yet from Facebook about what may be causing the problem or when those sites, including Messenger and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1445060216161116168"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, will be operational again, but we will update this article with more information when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches ‘Play Something’ for Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1zLWLwHvMmE_E0gZ817eEfTT70=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948609/Play_Something_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jsdBgm"&gt;Netflix is officially bringing its shuffle feature to its Android mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB9wjV"&gt;The company originally began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie"&gt;testing the Play Something feature&lt;/a&gt; back in April, but it’s officially launching the feature globally on Android today. The tool — which lets Netflix choose something for you to watch — is now available on TV and Android mobile devices, but it’s not supported on iOS just yet. Netflix said that it will begin testing the shuffle function on iOS in the coming months, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFlB09"&gt;Separately, Netflix is also launching its Fast Laughs feature — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311418/netflix-tiktok-clips-funny-movies-tv-shows-streaming-big-mouth-seinfeld"&gt;rolled out on iOS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — on Android mobile devices today in select markets, including the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Philippines, and the UK. The tool works like a highlight reel of funny clips from its series and films. It’s a little like TikTok but specifically for Netflix funnies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceVKgL"&gt;Lastly, Netflix said Monday that it’s bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295236/netflix-downloads-for-you-recomendations-streaming"&gt;Downloads for You&lt;/a&gt; tool to iOS in the coming month. Originally launched earlier this year on Android, the opt-in feature automatically downloads stuff to watch offline based on your viewing history. It’s a neat feature to have toggled on if, say, you plan to travel and don’t want to forget to download content for offline viewing before your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxju2m"&gt;The Play Something button launching today on Android, meanwhile, can be found on mobile devices on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen or roughly around the 17th row on the homepage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Google’s budget feature on Android so you don’t overspend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbPOvwu5O66nh4k60ryUXgFZhbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67661713/jbareham_181010_2989_0296.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnCBiu"&gt;Google has provided a budgeting feature in its Play Store that allows Android users to establish a monthly maximum they want to spend on digital content. This applies to apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. As you get close to reaching your budget limit, you’ll see an alert that you’re nearing it — or have gone over the amount you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrHNS5"&gt;You access it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qpmLYU"&gt;Open the Play Store on your Android device, tap on your personal icon on the upper right side, and select “Payments &amp;amp; subscriptions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ibqrH5"&gt;From there, select “Budget &amp;amp; history.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BTRG2W"&gt;You’ll see the amount you spent during the current month. Choose the “Set budget” option and enter the amount you’re comfortable spending on your apps, music, movies, TV shows, and ebooks for a month. Then hit “Save.” Your budget can always be adjusted or removed altogether from this same screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose an amount for your budget." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64XbKwh8Woe-_LFqcBHLDLzmxiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899906/Screenshot_20211004_110750.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose an amount for your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can remove or edit the budget anytime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1vHScBBWTV_5EbRSt2fr3-XI8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899908/Screenshot_20211004_110832.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remove or edit the budget anytime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biBi74"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9281767?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3364261"&gt;As Google notes&lt;/a&gt;, setting a budget won’t actually do anything to prevent purchases or subscriptions on your Google Play account once you’ve exceeded it. This feature is meant to be an easy reference for tracking your spending that you can take advantage of; it doesn’t implement hard restrictions like &lt;a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/"&gt;Google’s Family Link&lt;/a&gt; parental controls can. One other thing to know is that you can only set budgets using the currency of the country where your Google Play profile is linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WQRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2020, 2:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2019, and has been updated to reflect the fact that the feature is available to all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO4wzo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 2021, 11:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect changes in the Android interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo announces plans to go public in bid to accelerate shift to electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRGTR7LndinbJDayzQ5PJ4MSbro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948413/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNSCwN"&gt;Volvo, the Swedish luxury car maker owned by China’s Geely, &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/287174/volvo-cars-announces-its-intention-to-launch-an-initial-public-offering-and-list-on-nasdaq-stockholm"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; for an initial public offering as it seeks to raise more cash to accelerate its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;transition to a fully electric car company.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir54Rk"&gt;The announcement follows the news last week that Polestar, the electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. That deal values Polestar at roughly $20 billion, despite selling only two models — a hybrid luxury coupe and an all-electric fastback sedan. Volvo is choosing a more traditional route by proceeding with an IPO in Stockholm that could value the company at upwards of $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Deb6LN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XhJuqE"&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion, by issuing new shares. The aim is to use this money to speed up plans to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars in its bid to become an EV-only company by 2030. It also represents a dramatic comeback for Volvo, which was sold to Geely by a beleaguered Ford for just $1.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zka7fx"&gt;Volvo launched its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200-mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt;, we found it to be an “impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. The follow-up, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, will be available later this year, while an electric XC90 SUV won’t be revealed until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N0xTd"&gt;The listing would offer investors a chance to bet on the auto industry’s transition to fully electric vehicles at a time of rising concerns about tailpipe emissions and a crackdown by governments around the world on the production of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3dmW"&gt;Geely, which is the largest privately owned automaker in China, will sell some of its shares in Volvo as part of the IPO, though it hasn’t said how many nor how it could affect the company’s overall stake in the automaker. Earlier this year, the company backed off a plan to fully merge Volvo with Geely’s auto division. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A surgically implanted brain stimulation device could help treat severe depression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deus Ex Brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjmQVNESA4pogOKATHRzS9lwfSo=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948357/Deus_Ex_brain.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtvAn7"&gt;Sarah had no options left. Over five years, she’d tried every possible treatment for her severe depression, and nothing had helped. “My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day,” the 36-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yy6Nj"&gt;But after undergoing an experimental procedure that implanted a device into her brain, she felt her depression lift for the first time in years. “It was like my lens on the world changed,” Sarah, who is remaining anonymous because of the stigma around depression, said during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBaWGC"&gt;Sarah was the patient in a proof-of-concept trial of a new approach to treating severe, treatment-resistant depression, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The findings open up another possible strategy for helping people with the disorder. The study only involved Sarah, and it’s still not clear how well it might work in other people. The lessons from the trial, though, helped the researchers understand more about the nature of depression and could apply to other efforts to treat the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThGd44"&gt;“We identified through this trial some fundamental properties about the brain,” said study author Katherine Scangos, a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, during the press briefing. “We think these findings about the brain will be available for the general public, and will help us develop new personalized depression treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zE6n4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“depression is caused by faulty circuits”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICyAE2"&gt;The trial used a technique called deep brain stimulation, where electrodes implanted within the brain deliver electrical impulses in an attempt to change or regulate abnormal brain activity. It’s common for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Research over the past decade has shown that it can sometimes help with depression, but the findings have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. Most previous efforts delivered stimulation to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871707/"&gt;individual regions&lt;/a&gt; of the brain thought to be involved in depression. This study, though, was targeted at regions that were part of specific brain &lt;em&gt;circuits &lt;/em&gt;— interconnected parts of the brain that are responsible for specific functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjCE4s"&gt;“What we are increasingly realizing now is that depression is caused by faulty circuits,” Scangos says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuLzLq"&gt;In addition, the circuits involved might be different for each person. So in this trial, the study team personalized the treatment approach to the specific patient’s depression. They mapped out the type of brain activity that occurred when Sarah’s depression symptoms flared. Then, they surgically implanted a device that could detect that brain activity and send stimulation to the circuit where the activity was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMbHqU"&gt;For Sarah, the procedure was highly effective. Her scores on depression rating scales dropped the morning after the device was turned on. And perhaps more importantly, she felt dramatic changes in her mood. During her first time getting the stimulation, she laughed out loud in the lab. “And everyone in the room went, ‘Oh my god,’ because that’s the first time I spontaneously laughed and smiled, where it wasn’t faked, in five years,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAgicW"&gt;Sarah’s depression circuit flares up hundreds of times a day, and each time, the implanted device delivers a brief stimulating pulse. In total, she gets around 30 minutes of stimulation each day, Scangos says. Sarah can’t feel the pulses, but she said she does have a general idea of when they’re happening throughout the day. “There’s a sense of alertness and energy or positivity that I’ll feel,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAferA"&gt;Despite the overwhelming success for Sarah, this trial was just a first demonstration of this approach. The device used in the trial isn’t authorized to treat depression — it was originally designed to treat epilepsy and was used in the trial under an investigational device exemption from the FDA. “We have a lot of work ahead of us as a field to validate this result to see if it’s actually something that will be enduring as a treatment option,” said Edward Chang, an author on the study and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d1q15y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX9bR"&gt;If it proves to work for other people, it would likely be used only after trying all other options, Chang says. Surgery — especially brain surgery — is always a risk. For patients with Parkinson’s and epilepsy, patients who go that route have generally tried every other treatment. “For now, a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort,” Chang said. It’s an expensive approach, as well — the device used in this study typically costs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/11/16/245468383/new-medical-device-treats-epilepsy-with-a-well-timed-zap"&gt;between $35,000 and $40,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9PAaf"&gt;But even just this demonstration could help push our general understanding of depression forward. The team was able to identify circuitry in the brain involved in at least one person’s depressive symptoms, and that circuitry could be shared by other patients. Having foundational information about depression circuits could help develop non-surgical strategies that target similar areas. “Having this information and knowledge we think is going to go far beyond this application,” Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4C388"&gt;Sarah thinks her success could also help cut through some of the stigma around depression. Going through the study helped Sarah reframe her relationship with the disease, she said. For her whole life, she said she’d internalized some of the idea that she should be able to feel better if she picked herself up and tried hard enough. “We tried every treatment possible, and I had such a positive attitude through all of it, and none of it worked. And it just reinforced the depression, and made me feel like I was the world’s worst patient, and that was my own personal moral failing,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxsYFF"&gt;The trial changed that and helped the constant refrain from her doctors — that her depression was a disease in her brain — fully sink in. “By the end of this I went, ‘Oh my god, this is no different than someone with Parkinson’s,’” Sarah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWUnV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
