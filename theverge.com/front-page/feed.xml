    <title>Dems push Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for anti-radicalization changes after Capitol attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33JOxX"&gt;Only hours after gaining full control of Congress, House Democrats are going after Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for the platforms’ perceived roles in inciting violence at the Capitol earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGd0q5"&gt;In letters addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), along with dozens of other members, called for the companies to make sweeping changes to their platforms to curb violent and extremist activity on their networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUUvqq"&gt;The lawmakers accused the companies of using certain product features and algorithms that boost content that evokes extreme emotions as a means of increasing engagement, pointing out specific features they want to see changed on each platform. For YouTube, lawmakers said they would like to see the company disable auto-play and stop recommending any conspiratorial content alongside videos or on users’ homepages. Facebook was asked to start a “fundamental reexamination” of its use of user engagement “as the basis of algorithmic sorting and recommendation.” Lawmakers also asked Twitter to begin prompting users to quote-tweet tweets instead of automatically retweeting them when the retweet button is selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EepHlT"&gt;“The horrific damage to our democracy wrought on January 6th demonstrated how these social media platforms played a role in radicalizing and emboldening terrorists to attack our Capitol,” Eshoo said in a statement Thursday. “These American companies must fundamentally rethink algorithmic systems that are at odds with democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J4wJV"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FeMAT"&gt;Earlier Thursday, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called on FBI Director Chris Wray&lt;/a&gt; to open an investigation into Parler, a conservative-leaning Twitter dupe, following the pro-Trump Capitol attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glWTxR"&gt;Maloney said that the House Oversight Committee would begin its own probe into Parler and other social media websites like it. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/21/parler-fbi-russia-jan-6-capitol/"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Maloney said, “I am going to get to the bottom of who owns and funds social media platforms like Parler that condone and create violence.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new meme generator lets you drop Bernie Sanders and his chair around the world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting at the Southernmost point in the continental United States, Key West Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-dronwcbYAT6H5txLmyrcHXo8s=/0x168:640x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702404/Unknown_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve put him somewhere warm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PlMycU"&gt;You may have seen the many memes of Sen. Bernie Sanders sitting at President Joe Biden’s inauguration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;we even did a rundown of the best ones&lt;/a&gt;), but now &lt;a href="https://bernie-sits.herokuapp.com"&gt;there’s a website that lets you&lt;/a&gt; easily drop Bernie and his chair all over the world with the help of Google Maps’ Street View (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bernie-sanders-can-sit-anywhere-world-power-google-maps"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Simply put in a location or address in the website, and after one button click, you’ll have an image of Bernie sitting wherever you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXFMPU"&gt;The site, made by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043"&gt;NYU masters student Nick Sawhney&lt;/a&gt;, is pretty bare-bones, and it’s not exactly fast — though &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bernie-sanders-meme-street-view-site"&gt;the fact that it’s getting a lot of traffic&lt;/a&gt; could be partially to blame. As you can imagine, there are a lot of people, like me, using it for shenanigans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avrvdq"&gt;Here are a couple of examples Sawhney made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8KZfH2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I made a website where you can put bernie in places using google maps street view. Enjoy!&lt;a href="https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k"&gt;https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8rstiEXOHf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8rstiEXOHf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nick (@nick_sawhney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GYViCT"&gt;And here are the results of me goofing around with the site for an embarrassing amount of time: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HIlaps8-3UxJF9Gc-EKElQpHwk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250823/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.02.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie’s taking a break after Rocky-running up the stairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting in front of a t-rex statue" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MvkWOipR6y4llq2Z9M2wm_LIzYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250826/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.11.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh cool, I didn’t know Bernie was a Fallout: New Vegas fan!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTm5eCVtUdbqTaLf0MLdjI5_p30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250844/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.24.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie visiting Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRIHNI5mU3hcia1QxrM87OEZPjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250854/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.27.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie! Watch out for the flying fish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of Bernie sitting at the Green Dragon Inn in Hobbiton from Lord of the Rings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kSATqDDN6yHYB18o1BpO2nECsCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250866/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.31.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie’s looking for the best brew in the Shire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ELV0gO"&gt;Three cheers to Sawhney for this glorious meme generator. I’m sorry for how much I cost you in Google Maps API calls and Heroku fees. (If you want to help keep the site up, you can &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nicksawhney"&gt;toss Sawhney a few bucks here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil Village will launch on May 7th, 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3cKmU-C5e_7442BKBsIIdi7VAU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702356/EsRryLBXIAAE_Yd.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGeg3K"&gt;The eighth mainline &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game now has a release date. Today at a live-streamed event, developer Capcom announced that &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will be coming to the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 7th, 2021 — as well as current-generation consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One. The company also announced that a demo will be available for PS5 owners later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGz3hG"&gt;The event also provided a first proper look at the game with a new, rather unsettling trailer, which you can see above. It gives a good look at the disturbing castle where &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; takes place, along with glimpse at pure gameplay. Like the last &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;, the new title is a first-person survival horror experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phcthE"&gt;In addition to the single-player RE game, Capcom revealed &lt;em&gt;Re:Verse&lt;/em&gt;, a multiplayer title featuring major characters from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; universe. It’ll be available for free for anyone who buys &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NvShiv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtX1pxZ3aqE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpg7a1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; was first announced during a PS5 reveal event last year, and it comes at a time when the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series is at a high point creatively. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; reinvigorated the franchise&lt;/a&gt; with a renewed focus on horror, and it was followed by two well-received remakes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of the games, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;a new live-action TV series in the works at Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Raspberry Pi Pico is a tiny $4 microcontroller running off the company’s very own chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2wjkT1JmJk1CPybafJRHXD5LUQ=/0x20:1053x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702186/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_9.08.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfMCrH"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Foundation’s tiny computers can be used for anything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21306907/diy-camera-raspberry-pi-high-quality-how-to-build-video-c-cs-mount-lenses"&gt;homemade cameras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/now-added-cucumbers/"&gt;cucumber sorters&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the group is branching out into microcontrollers and custom silicon. &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Pico&lt;/a&gt; is the first step. It’s a new $4 microcontroller that’s smaller than the average Pi, features a custom chip powerful enough to be used in machine learning projects (according to The Raspberry Pi Foundation), and is on sale now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ949x"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/"&gt;introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that today’s Raspberry Pis are already often used alongside a smaller microcontroller: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9c8SeO"&gt;The Raspberry Pi takes care of heavyweight computation, network access, and storage, while the microcontroller handles analogue input and low-latency I/O and, sometimes, provides a very low-power standby mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzLkdv"&gt;Now, the company has one of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Les6Wt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-tRJPCv0GA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyd1nJ"&gt;In a first for the microcomputer maker, the Pico is powered by a custom chip designed in house called the RP2040. The Pico board features the new chip, 2MB of flash memory, a clickable button, and a Micro USB Type B port. Here are the RP2040’s full specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOji8r"&gt;Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARe7Se"&gt;264KB (remember kilobytes?) of on-chip RAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRIfVW"&gt;Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BP8CB"&gt;DMA controller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGGVkK"&gt;Interpolator and integer divider peripherals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqDJyz"&gt;30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analogue inputs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHWRLp"&gt;2 × UARTs, 2 × SPI controllers, and 2 × I2C controllers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6VnZ5"&gt;16 × PWM channels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPoDRQ"&gt;1 × USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgPQOu"&gt;8 × Raspberry Pi Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjXH9o"&gt;USB mass-storage boot mode with UF2 support, for drag-and-drop programming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9cZHMz"&gt;Those specs might go in one ear and out the other, but the best way to illustrate the potential for a new Raspberry Pi product is to see it used in something cool. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is partnering with companies like Arduino, Adafruit, and Pimoroni to integrate the new RP2040 chip into other boards and gadgets. There’s a whole list in the blog post announcing the Pico, but a few notable ones are &lt;a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem"&gt;Pimoroni’s PicoSystem&lt;/a&gt; game console, Adafruit’s &lt;a href="https://adafruit.com/feather2040"&gt;Feather RP 2040 board&lt;/a&gt;, and the Arduino &lt;a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/01/20/welcome-raspberry-pi-to-the-world-of-microcontrollers/"&gt;Nano RP2040 Connect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4jrAR"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Pico is available now from &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/"&gt;approved resellers&lt;/a&gt; for $4. The microcontroller will also be given away for free in February issues of &lt;a href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/39"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HackSpace magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden orders masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, and public transportation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Subway Train in New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQuIh_EXAXE4y-WtzHdwByzgrSE=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701876/1257624396.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Gary Hershorn / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gP1uTd"&gt;President Joe Biden issued an executive order Thursday requiring masks to be worn on public transportation. It was the latest abrupt change from his predecessor Donald Trump, who actively blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from issuing a similar order last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyFpw5"&gt;The order mandates that passengers and employees wear face coverings on planes, trains, buses, subways, and other modes of public transportation. “Ensuring that people can safely travel will be critical for families and to jump starting the economy,” the Biden administration writes in its &lt;a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/national-strategy-for-the-covid-19-response/c7bd8ecb9308d669/full.pdf"&gt;COVID-19 response plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4DXbb"&gt;The Trump administration killed an earlier effort to require masks on transportation, arguing the decision should be up to individual states and localities. Trump also spent many crucial months of the pandemic implying face masks were unnecessary, effectively politicizing the issue of mask-wearing. The CDC had proposed requiring face coverings, but the White House coronavirus task force, headed by former Vice President Mike Pence, refused to discuss it, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/health/coronavirus-covid-masks-cdc.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7JYtl3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Trump administration killed an earlier effort to require masks on transportation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cuya5"&gt;Public health officials have uniformly recommended the wearing of masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus, particularly in crowded, poorly ventilated areas. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC “strongly recommends” wearing masks on transportation to reduce the chance of getting and spreading COVID-19 — though now that recommendation will be backed up with the force of a presidential mandate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avCkVP"&gt;Mass transit ridership has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179032/public-transportation-coronavirus-covid19-ridership-nyc-sf-la-dc"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; in the year since the coronavirus was first detected in the US. For example, ridership on New York City’s notoriously packed commuter trains &lt;a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 92 percent in mid-April when the city emerged as an epicenter of the global health crisis. Riders have begun to return to public transportation, but ridership numbers are still lagging behind their pre-pandemic levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmOlCP"&gt;Some municipalities took steps to enforce their own mask rules. The MTA, for example, over the summer began imposing a $50 fine on riders who refused to wear a mask. But the New York Police Department rarely hands out tickets: as of November, the department had only fined 15 people for noncompliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfbs1q"&gt;There is little evidence that mass transit poses a particular risk for COVID-19 outbreaks. While the US lags behind other countries with regard to contact tracing, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/there-is-little-evidence-that-mass-transit-poses-a-risk-of-coronavirus-outbreaks/"&gt;experts agree&lt;/a&gt; that riding trains and buses is much safer if all of the passengers and employees are wearing masks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIEDJA"&gt;Airlines have also been left to enforce their own mask rules. Most major airlines have eliminated any medical exemptions to their rules, and several are cracking down on the types of face coverings allowed. All airlines insist passengers wear a mask as soon as they enter an airport and to keep it on throughout the travel journey except to briefly remove it to drink or eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUhzaS"&gt;The new order was issued on the same day that Biden’s nominee for transportation secretary, former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, will sit for his Senate confirmation hearing. Buttigieg is expected to play a pivotal role in Biden’s push for a bipartisan infrastructure deal. The president has vowed to spend $1.3 trillion to build new schools, roads, bridges, railroads, and pipes, while also expanding broadband access and attacking climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFpx5"&gt;During the hearing, Buttigieg said Biden was prepared to enforce its new mask mandate across multiple federal agencies. “We were prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the president’s executive order,” he said, “to ensure that across every mode of transportation, workers, passengers, and commuters are protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJkfr8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Otter.ai’s new Chrome extension can transcribe Google Meet calls in real time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8FuOr49gjn1nckVi09bNk6LoUA=/3x322:960x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701806/Otter_Google_Meet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render showing how Otter.ai’s Chrome extension works in Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Otter.ai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVSaMk"&gt;You can now use automated transcription service Otter.ai to transcribe and provide closed captions for Google Meet calls with the help of a new Chrome extension. Meetings will be transcribed in real time, and transcripts will be saved right to your Otter account so you can access and share them later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkdaRd"&gt;Otter.ai says the extension works with all of its plans, meaning even free users will be able to take advantage of the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RCZYZO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iu2N44Por-4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfDO2M"&gt;To set it up, first download the Otter.ai &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otterai/bnmojkbbkkonlmlfgejehefjldooiedp?hl=en"&gt;Chrome extension here&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’ve installed it, head over to &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com"&gt;meet.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and then click on the Otter extension. (You might need to click the puzzle piece icon to open the extensions menu to find it.) Then, you may be prompted to log in to use the extension, though I was already logged in when I tested it. From there, log into your meeting, tap the “record” button from the Otter extension, and you should see the transcription start to fill out in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFvTTw"&gt;You can also activate closed captions by clicking the button with “cc” surrounded by a box in the Otter window. But Google Meet already offers a closed captions feature, which you can turn on by clicking a similar icon in the menu at the bottom of a Meet window, so picking which to use will be a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJSi1a"&gt;Otter.ai doesn’t just do live transcriptions of Google Meet calls; the service also integrates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;directly with Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. But to use Otter’s integrated live transcriptions in Zoom, you’ll need to be on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;paid Otter and Zoom plan&lt;/a&gt;, unlike with Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>President Biden to use Defense Production Act for masks, vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="N95 Masks Production In Mexico City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2I4xpmy1lUFYwgPflRCVam4Gho=/0x2:5200x3469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701764/1214498089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read Carlos Tischler / Eyepix Group/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Icj1fz"&gt;President Joe Biden will direct federal agencies to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up the supply of masks, testing kits, and vaccine materials. The action is part of a blitz of executive orders Biden has issued during his first few days in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlVWEZ"&gt;“We’ve already identified suppliers and are working with them to move the plan forward,” Biden &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1352342243441426432"&gt;said in a briefing today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDuAS"&gt;The administration hopes the DPA can accelerate vaccine production. &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/compliance/articles/1346836/how-defense-production-act-may-affect-vaccine-supply-chain"&gt;The plan&lt;/a&gt; highlights the need for more vials that hold the vaccine doses, syringes to deliver it, and dry ice critical to their transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq2p5Z"&gt;“We’ll do whatever we need to do to ensure that we have an adequate supply of vaccine,” &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/21/biden-10-executive-orders-pandemic-460996"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tim Manning, Biden’s COVID-19 supply coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGoCmD"&gt;The administration will also direct the act to target masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Shortages of these products aren’t quite as dire as they were early on in the pandemic, but health care workers are &lt;a href="https://getusppe.org/ppe-shortage-briefing-fair-distribution-algorithm-and-equitable-vaccine-delivery/"&gt;still in need of more N95 masks&lt;/a&gt;, which protect the wearer in high-risk situations like when treating COVID-19 patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnrFTy"&gt;Increasing production of masks could also improve protection for the general public. Most Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;still wearing cloth masks&lt;/a&gt;. Those types of masks can help blunt the spread of the virus, but they aren’t as effective as surgical or N95s. Other countries are making medical-grade masks &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/20/france-may-follow-germany-in-making-clinical-masks-mandatory"&gt;mandatory&lt;/a&gt;. As the more contagious coronavirus strain starts to spread in the US, experts worry cloth masks won’t offer enough protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPJzAp"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html"&gt;still says&lt;/a&gt; members of the general public should not buy surgical masks or N95s to conserve supply for health care workers. “Hopefully this gets utilized to bring better personal protection to the general public,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran/status/1352101961336721408"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response, in response to news about the DPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0z5S92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes, vaccines are here, but so is B.1.1.7. We need to up our mask game, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@abraarkaran&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes below: N95s for all. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MonicaGandhi9&lt;/a&gt; and I also wrote about better masks in &lt;a href="https://t.co/qzKPoQp7kf"&gt;https://t.co/qzKPoQp7kf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AAGhfe9CDr"&gt;https://t.co/AAGhfe9CDr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/x9aA53CWBx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x9aA53CWBx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Linsey Marr (@linseymarr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/linseymarr/status/1347223352725876740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2NONl"&gt;Nurses and doctors have been calling for the White House to invoke the DPA to improve the supply of masks since early on in the pandemic. The American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Nurses Association wrote to former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2020-03-21-aha-ama-and-ana-letter-president-use-dpa-medical-supplies-and-equipment"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; asking for him to use the act. The nurses &lt;a href="https://www.mcknights.com/news/clinical-news/nurses-ask-feds-to-invoke-defense-production-act-for-n95-masks-survey-finds-unacceptable-reuse-levels/"&gt;asked again&lt;/a&gt; in September after surveys found continued shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfYLhL"&gt;Trump invoked the DPA a handful of times while in office, but experts and industry leaders say he didn’t use it to a degree sufficient enough to make a dent in the supply needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Trump administration’s use of the DPA has been sporadic, vindictive and too late,” Scott Paul, president of the industry group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/health/Covid-Trump-Defense-Production-Act.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this fall. “They have not wielded the tool very effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge refuses to reinstate Parler’s Amazon account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4JVjXZiDe0q-k-7eej824oQacoY=/347x0:3368x2014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701756/1230527730.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tTkjMw"&gt;A Washington judge has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.294664/gov.uscourts.wawd.294664.34.0_2.pdf"&gt;denied social network Parler’s demand&lt;/a&gt; to be reinstated on Amazon Web Services. Following a hearing last week, Judge Barbara Rothstein declined to grant a preliminary injunction in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;a lawsuit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saying Parler provided “dwindlingly slight” evidence for an antitrust complaint and “failed to allege basic facts” of improper business activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHTel4"&gt;While the case isn’t over, the ruling bodes ill for Parler’s chances in court. “Parler’s allegations at this time are both inaccurate and unsupported, and are disputed by evidence submitted by [Amazon Web Services],” Rothstein wrote in an order. Parler will need to find another web host or remain dormant while it continues its legal battle with Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y20deK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parler’s allegations at this time are both inaccurate and unsupported.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zcpRx"&gt;Rothstein was also unmoved by Parler’s claims that the suspension posed a devastating financial blow. She noted that Parler hadn’t denied that its users posted violent, detailed threats on the platform before and around Trump supporters’ January 6th attack on the US Capitol. While it promised to change its moderation policies, “forcing [Amazon] to host Parler’s users’ violent content would interfere with AWS’s ability to prevent its services from being used to promote — and, as the events of January 6, 2021 have demonstrated, even cause — violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bxOSF"&gt;Parler promotes itself as a more lightly moderated alternative to Twitter and Facebook, and it’s attracted supporters of former President Donald Trump, who lambasted those larger sites for labeling false claims that he won the 2020 election. But after the attack on the Capitol, web infrastructure companies cut ties. Apple and Google pulled Parler’s app from their app stores, and Amazon Web Services suspended its account, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;knocking the site offline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMgFXy"&gt;Parler retaliated by suing the cloud hosting giant. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;claimed Amazon had banned it&lt;/a&gt; from “political animus” and a desire to protect its competitor Twitter, which also uses Amazon Web Services. (Twitter is not a party to the lawsuit, although Parler has suggested it may sue companies besides Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNtiJ8"&gt;Amazon, in turn, claimed Parler disregarded repeated warnings about violent threats. “We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content,” a spokesperson said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;That included&lt;/a&gt; detailed calls to violence against teachers, professional athletes, Black and Jewish people, and a swathe of specific politicians and tech executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpXGHH"&gt;Parler’s future remains uncertain, although much of its user content was &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archived-parler-explains-how-she-did-it-and-what-comes-next"&gt;backed up by archivists&lt;/a&gt; before deletion. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/parler-ceo-platform-strong-changes-free-speech"&gt;CEO John Matze told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the platform wanted to “come back strong,” and its home page relaunched with a promise to “resolve any challenge before us and plan to welcome all of you back soon.” However, the network itself remains offline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s decentralized social network project takes a baby step forward</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7EIkH"&gt;Bluesky, Twitter’s decentralized social networking effort, has announced its first major update since 2019. The Bluesky team released a review of the decentralized web ecosystem and said it’s hoping to find a team lead in the coming months. The review follows Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992"&gt;discussing Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, when he called it a “standard for the public conversation layer of the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPeahZ"&gt;The review &lt;a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/twitter.modular.im/981b258141aa0b197804127cd2f7d298757bad20"&gt;outlines a variety&lt;/a&gt; of known decentralized systems. It includes ActivityPub, known for powering the social network Mastodon; the messaging standard XMPP, which powers WhatsApp and the now-defunct Google Talk; and Solid, a decentralization project led by World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The report covers how these systems handle key social network elements like discoverability, moderation, and privacy, as well as how services based on them can scale up, interoperate, and make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gWusPr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Working virtually through the pandemic, this group self-organized, invited additional experts, and created a review of the ecosystem around protocols for social media. You can read it here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/U5DczWX1qb"&gt;https://t.co/U5DczWX1qb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bluesky (@bluesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1352302821140549632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orec2v"&gt;This doesn’t tell us how Bluesky itself might operate. Dorsey said that Bluesky would “take time to build.” If it results in a protocol, that system might be created from scratch, or it might build on an existing standard like ActivityPub — a possibility Dorsey mentioned in 2019 upon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;unveiling the initiative&lt;/a&gt;. “We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvAgWf"&gt;However, the report offers a snapshot of who’s been working on Bluesky. It was authored by Jay Graber, creator of event-organizing platform Happening. Other contributors include Mastodon developer Eugen Rochko, peer-to-peer Beaker Browser co-creator Paul Frazee, ActivityPub standard co-editor Christopher Lemmer Webber, and InterPlanetary File System project lead Molly Mackinlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtubMD"&gt;It also hints at the fact that decentralization often isn’t profitable. The report focuses on monetization options like membership fees and cryptocurrency microtransactions, but it also notes that “many decentralized projects run on volunteer work and donations” — something that isn’t ideal for a platform supporting commercial networks like Twitter. That said, platforms have worked on systems like the Brave browser’s &lt;a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/"&gt;Basic Attention Token&lt;/a&gt;, a cryptocurrency-based system for sharing ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCvsh7"&gt;Given the long gap between Bluesky’s announcement and this early step, we may not see Twitter’s plans for a universal standard anytime soon, let alone see Twitter adopt that standard. As some decentralized developers mentioned in 2019, Twitter could also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"&gt;potentially do more good&lt;/a&gt; by contributing resources to existing projects — not trying to spearhead a unified standard. However, the new paper signals that Bluesky is trying to build on what people in the field have already discovered... even if we don’t know where it might go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
