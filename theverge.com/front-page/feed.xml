    <title>Sen. Ron Wyden proposes $500 million to fix US unemployment systems</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qodGoc"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Unemployment%20Insurance%20Technology%20Modernization%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;put out a new bill&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that would overhaul the US’s crumbling unemployment benefits systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFBRxb"&gt;Over the last year, outdated state unemployment systems have kept jobless Americans from accessing the increased benefits approved by the federal government to curb the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Wyden’s new $500 million plan would create standardized tools for states that choose to adopt them. The Department of Labor would be in charge of creating these tools with the help of outside tech experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VXnso"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many states have been unable to get benefits out the door in a timely manner”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0ZSa7"&gt;“While enhanced jobless benefits have enabled millions and millions of families to pay the rent and buy groceries, many states have been unable to get benefits out the door in a timely manner,” Wyden said in a statement Wednesday. “I have heard story after story from Oregonians who have spent months trying to get their jobless benefits. That’s completely unacceptable when families are depending on these benefits to keep a roof over their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utTavM"&gt;Wyden’s bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkkE2H"&gt;State unemployment offices are in charge of maintaining their own benefits systems. Some states choose to build their own while others, like California, have contracts with outside vendors. Many of these unemployment systems were built nearly decades ago in ancient coding languages that aren’t frequently taught in school and are widely known by programmers who are quickly aging out of the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fviued"&gt;Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219561/coronavirus-pandemic-unemployment-systems-cobol-legacy-software-infrastructure"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that at least 12 state systems, like those in Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, and Kansas, were partially coded in COBOL, an over 40-year-old coding language very few programmers learn anymore. This makes it difficult for these systems to be fixed when they melt down under the pressure of requests caused by the pandemic. Only one COBOL programmer maintained Colorado’s system before the coronavirus outbreak, according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtif8g"&gt;States like Colorado continue to face mounting problems with their unemployment systems as some unemployed Coloradans have gone weeks and months without payments. Earlier this week, protestors marched on Colorado’s Department of Labor due to the faulty system, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/12/colorado-labor-department-new-unemployment-claims-system-problems/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Denver Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To fix its issues, Colorado launched a new system last month called “MyUI+,” which had a rough rollout after some people said they were unable to create accounts for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA7DEu"&gt;Congress continues to negotiate its next economic stimulus package as a result of the pandemic. Democrats are looking to approve this latest package &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/business/child-tax-credit-congress.html"&gt;by mid-March&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that heightened unemployment benefits continue through the summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Silver%2F460189043%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $300 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731914581454635364" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731916007873570613" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $380&lt;/a&gt; which’s $50 off its usual retail price of $429. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-651" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PRD2NQ7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5338385a3949a01d236ad3cfbdbfb96d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;384 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, or for $530 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5WFP7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $559 if you buy this configuration in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get buy it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; for $569, or for $570 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FD94H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J62F1RH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-120" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the 128GB model with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; marked down to $749 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863358NV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration in space gray only for $846&lt;/a&gt;. If you are okay with spending $1,000 or more, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BT4DD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,049 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,234 (with coupon);&lt;/a&gt; that’s $69 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $929&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08637TYPT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray for $1,399&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449 for silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Please wear layers to your vaccine appointment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask sits in a chair with his shirt unbuttoned and half of his torso exposed as he gets the vaccine." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Sgj4KCujYne5yRnKk672Oow_hA=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798471/1230653071.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VIB8nV"&gt;Vaccine selfies — vaxxies, if you will — abound as more people are vaccinated against COVID-19 every day. People are anxiously awaiting their turn to get the jab, perhaps so anxiously that they forget to think about what’s best to wear for the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ghx8t"&gt;One of the most recent vaxxies to make the rounds is of the French minister of health. He’s wearing a typically boring dress shirt, but it’s completely unbuttoned as his bare arm is stuck. He gazes solemnly into the middle distance as he tastefully conceals his nipple with the shirt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="alf7go"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Vacciné. &lt;a href="https://t.co/smhltj74D1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/smhltj74D1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Olivier Véran (@olivierveran) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olivierveran/status/1358735918815997955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Scx9i"&gt;Other European officials have gone even farther. The &lt;a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/01/18/greek-pm-second-dose-covid-vaccine/"&gt;Greek prime minister’s vaxxie&lt;/a&gt; calls to mind &lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lely-portrait-of-an-unknown-woman-t00755"&gt;classic paintings of women&lt;/a&gt; with one breast exposed. One member of the UK Parliament opted to go entirely topless when he received the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WyuIBf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rarely do they see such a wimp in these parts when it comes to injections, but the lovely staff at Derriford Hospital made it all as seamless as ever this morning, in the latest round of the COVID-19 vaccine trial we’re doing here in Plymouth..    &lt;a href="https://t.co/nDrhhXjCUM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nDrhhXjCUM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Johnny Mercer (@JohnnyMercerUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyMercerUK/status/1357622588277669891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qyu3Cv"&gt;To be clear, unveiling this much skin is not a requirement for getting one of the COVID-19 vaccines. It’s just tough to get to the top of the arm meat — where the vaccine needs to be injected — with a tight, long sleeve in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHgDcB"&gt;Health centers generally recommend &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/how-to-prepare-before-getting-a-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;wearing layers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.beaumont.org/health-wellness/blogs/preparing-for-your-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-at-beaumont"&gt;short sleeves&lt;/a&gt;. You could opt for a nice &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/joe-biden-covid-vaccine-coronavirus-covid-19-gets/9561849/"&gt;casual polo&lt;/a&gt;, the classic cardigan over a tank top combo, or simply remember to wear an undershirt with your button-up. You could also lean into a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene_in_Ecstasy#/media/File:Artemisia_Gentileschi_-_Mary_Magdalene_in_Ecstasy.jpg"&gt;baroque off-the-shoulder look&lt;/a&gt; with a loose enough shirt. For the sake of your local health care workers, though, I can’t say I recommend going for full Renaissance, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus#/media/File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birth of Venus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vibes. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what outfit you choose, as long as you get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is bringing back Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s Clone High animated series </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3o-3tQr_18P0SC2RF4He99acbZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798427/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1q0ws"&gt;HBO Max is bringing back &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt;, the animated series from Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Bill Lawrence that originally ran for one season starting in 2002. It was essentially a parody of typical high school dramas, but one set at a school for the clones of historical figures like Cleopatra and Gandhi. HBO calls the new version “a modern refresh of the hit series” and says that all three creators are on board. The show is being produced by MTV Entertainment Studios and Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the first season who also worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494248/sacha-baron-cohen-borat-sequel-amazon-prime-video-streaming-release"&gt;the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Borat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will serve as showrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KSOzwu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 22 Jump Street directors tell us how to make a sequel that doesn’t suck","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5801938/22-jump-street-phil-lord-chris-miller-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aLo9Xq"&gt;Lord and Miller have been on a roll in recent years, working on films like &lt;em&gt;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs&lt;/em&gt;, 2&lt;em&gt;1 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;, and serving as executive producers on &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, has seen a surprising resurgence of popularity on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTOcP"&gt;The news comes alongside two other animated series orders from HBO Max. The streaming service will also be getting an adult &lt;em&gt;Scooby Doo&lt;/em&gt; spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Velma&lt;/em&gt;, starring Mindy Kaling in the titular role (she’s also an executive producer on the show) as well as &lt;em&gt;Fired On Mars&lt;/em&gt;, “an existential workplace comedy set on the Martian campus of a modern tech company” starring Pete Davidson. There’s no word yet on when the new shows will debut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League developer is adding a Ford F-150 to the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7maEI9JaxIE-QwxukVtsbSZKoDc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798206/f150_core_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaq8tB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; developer Psyonix announced today it's partnering with an auto company to add an actual truck into the game. Sadly, no, it is not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;. It's the Ford F-150. A &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;-themed F-150 will be available for a limited time, beginning February 20th until February 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0Sz0R"&gt;The Ford F-150 RLE bundle will be available in the item shop with its own tab and costs 1,500 credits. The bundle includes the Ford F-150 RLE (pictured below), a set of standard and special edition wheels, boost, audio engine, player banner, and decal, all of which are themed after the special edition pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pC9Gzd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10334323"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGru4L"&gt;As someone who enjoys pickup trucks, I am crying tears of joy because I can use one in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;. There is something hilarious about the fact that I can drive a rocket-powered F-150 in the game and do ridiculous trick shots with it. I really want to see other auto companies like Chevrolet and Toyota add their trucks to the game. Seriously, imagine having the Tesla Cybertruck in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;; I’d never stop laughing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Npgr9A"&gt;Alongside a new, limited-time vehicle, Psyonix and Ford are also introducing a new competitive two-day event where the best freestyles in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; will compete and demonstrate their best moves for a chance to win a real 2021 Ford F-150. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s new MetaHuman tool lets you craft realistic faces inside a browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fFw8i6wR-iciookm-Us46KzKMw=/56x0:644x392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798169/epic_meta_human_creator.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="olQHfa"&gt;Epic Games has announced a new, browser-based software tool powered by its Unreal Engine called the &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/digital-humans"&gt;MetaHuman Creator&lt;/a&gt; that can craft highly realistic human faces and help power more realistic body movements and facial animations. Epic provided a sneak peek at the platform today in a pair of YouTube videos showing off examples of creations built using the MetaHuman Creator, and “metahuman” appears to be the term the company is using to describe this brand of virtual, non-real individual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ow8Dw"&gt;Epic says the MetaHuman Creator can be used in conjunction with modern motion capture and animation techniques for creating lifelike movements and human interactions scenes built for video games, film, TV, and other formats. The company says these photorealistic humans can be generated in a matter of minutes and equipped with unique hairstyles and clothing, and then they can be tailored further to meet the needs of a production. And these “metahumans” can be manipulated in real time within the tool itself and just using a web browser, Epic says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LpT5pX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3F1vZYpH8c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JMkhT6"&gt;“Up until now one of the most arduous tasks in 3D content creation has been constructing truly convincing digital humans. Even the most experienced artists require significant amounts of time, effort, and equipment, just for one character,” said Vladimir Mastilovic, Epic’s vice president of digital humans technology, in a statement. “After decades of research and development, and thanks to bringing companies like 3Lateral, Cubic Motion, and Quixel into the Epic family, that barrier is being erased through Unreal Engine, and we’re thrilled to introduce MetaHuman Creator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDuF1B"&gt;The humans created with Epic’s new tool don’t approach the photorealism of, say, the digitally rendered photographs of fake people produced by generative adversarial networks, which is the AI technique underpinning projects like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18244984/ai-generated-fake-which-face-is-real-test-stylegan"&gt;“This Person Does Not Exist.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpHWl5qlbGEj1q6xDlGKiF4O3ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294597/epic_meta_human_creator.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AKsT9o"&gt;But as a kind of supercharged video game character creation tool, MetaHuman Creator does seem capable of making some shockingly realistic-looking people that could easily pass for a real-life motion captured actor. Though perhaps we’d need to wait to see what the tool is truly capable of in the hands of third-party creators before making a verdict on whether it escapes the uncanny valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4kpQo"&gt;It’s not clear when Epic intends to release MetaHuman Creator outside a broad 2021 release window, but interested developers and artists can &lt;a href="https://ue.unrealengine.com/ENT-1883-01-2021-Digital-Humans_LP.html"&gt;sign up for updates on the Unreal Engine website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is turning iconic series Redwall into a TV show, film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1M9CFRksLgqD8Kvz0niTQwSvKI=/223x0:978x503/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798161/Et1wZBOVoAAcZxI.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUe0lp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt;, Brian Jacques’ fantasy novels about heroic anthropomorphic animals, is coming to Netflix in a new film and TV show. The company announced on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1359492313081393153"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Over the Garden Wall&lt;/em&gt; creator Patrick McHale is helming the project. The movie will be based on the series’s first book, &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt;, while the TV show will tackle the story of Martin the Warrior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eB4dEa"&gt;Jacques, who died in 2011, published &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; in 1986. The book follows a young mouse monk, Matthias, as he defends Redwall Abbey from an invading rodent army. Matthias’ story is deeply linked to Martin’s, a legendary warrior whom he idolizes. Although &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; has been previously made into a TV show, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-redwall-movie-tv-show-brian-jacques-1234904865/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the Netflix deal is the first time the same company has held rights to the entire series. It’s also the first time &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; has gotten a movie adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uXbrX"&gt;Netflix hasn’t released any additional details about the adaptations, including who will play key voice roles or when it will be released. The &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; series spans 22 novels, with the last published posthumously in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s most affordable iPad is even cheaper at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUo2kCyGrGnmfsqkSO3DiYNXJN8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798148/DSC01911.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqtUnA"&gt;Starting at $329, Apple’s most affordable iPad model comes at a very attractive price — but if you have been holding off in the hopes of buying it at an even better price, your patience has paid off. At &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (in select colors), you can buy a 32GB model for $299; you can also get it for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731914581454635364" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price we have seen for this model to date. If you need a little bit more storage, you can grab the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731909318076698536" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model at Best Buy for $380&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GyzV5"&gt;While its design looks similar to its predecessor, the 2020 iPad model features a faster A12 Bionic processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HFw4ZS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cZKIq"&gt;Over at OnePlus’ website, now until February 17th, the company has a few discounts going. Most notably, you can grab an unlocked &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-8-pro%3Ffrom%3D8pro#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro with 12GB of RAM 256GB of storage for $799&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off). If you buy the phone directly from the OnePlus website, you will also receive an Urban backpack at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hjeC34"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10335875"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ReHGBt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, the &lt;em&gt;Will of the Wisps,&lt;/em&gt; are 2D Metroidvania platformer titles known for their stunning visuals. Both games are available on Microsoft’s subscription service, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergdeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have a subscription or want to own the games in your digital library, you can grab &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergdeals&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fori-the-collection%2F9p5mbbff3rnt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori: The Collection&lt;/em&gt; for $12&lt;/a&gt; at the Microsoft Store — that's roughly $24 off its usual price of $35. The compilation includes both titles and is compatible with the Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GGkFO5nAOrnsUmAJF7szxbdGn4s=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68774775/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5GHXZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 10th, 10:31AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bullet list at the bottom now reflects that Gigabyte has updated all of its product pages with the required information about the RTX 30-series graphics chips its laptops use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emYkbk"&gt;Nvidia is now requiring, not just encouraging, companies selling laptops with its new RTX 30-series graphics chips to be more transparent about the kind of power people can expect. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;these companies will have to disclose specific clock speed stats and total graphics power on online product pages — all of which tells people everything they need to know about a laptop’s graphics potential, for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXHuKd"&gt;However, companies won’t have to mention that these chips are Max-Q variants because, according to an Nvidia spokesperson, “Max-Q is no longer part of the GPU name.” Rather, Max-Q is now solely used to communicate that a laptop with an RTX 30-series graphics chip ships with efficiency features like Whisper Mode 2, Dynamic Boost 2, and Advanced Optimus. Previously, seeing Max-Q branding made it easy to determine a laptop’s general performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2DsTp"&gt;It’s encouraging to see Nvidia no longer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;allows companies to hide this vital information&lt;/a&gt; from marketing materials. It should go far enough in helping buyers make an educated purchase without having to wait on reviewers and early adopters to report on the specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RsrBF"&gt;By sharing these specs, companies can make it much easier for consumers to understand how it’s possible that, in some instances, the RTX 3070 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI’s GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; can outperform an RTX 3080 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, which is something we saw first-hand. Since the Max-Q brand no longer signifies a graphics chip’s power capabilities, being transparent with clock speed and how much power it can consume is more crucial than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7bY5R4IZGgiPi2jLRWNzVa8gRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260491/nvidia_ampere_mobile_gpus_tdp.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia now requires companies share the clock speed and power on laptop product pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7RJdo"&gt;“We’re requiring OEMs to update their product pages to the Max-Q technology features for each GeForce laptop, as well as clocks and power — which communicates the expected GPU performance in that system,” an Nvidia spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpvjoM"&gt;Nvidia says manufacturers have already begun sharing this info, including Asus and Gigabyte, which we confirmed at the time of publishing. We’re going to keep tabs on some models coming out soon (and those currently on the market) to see how long it takes for these requirements to roll out across the industry. Let us know in the comments if you notice that one has been updated with info or needs to be added to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The TikTok-Oracle deal is on life support under Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkQTlYHLYoTtKCON0NHcYymGj1w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798018/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAb3Aa"&gt;Nearly five months after it was announced, a proposed hosting deal between Oracle and TikTok is on permanent hold, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The deal has been “shelved indefinitely” pending a broader review of the Trump administration’s China policy, says the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, citing sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2aLgV"&gt;Oracle announced in September that it was planning to take over as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” for the United States as part of a broader arrangement by the Trump White House. But the deal was widely criticized as a “glorified hosting deal” that did little to resolve underlying concerns about Chinese government influence over the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV11wU"&gt;The Trump White House had pushed hard for a deal between TikTok and some US corporation, beginning with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a legally dubious executive order on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; that sought to ban any transactions with the company unless security concerns could be resolved. After extensive discussions, Treasury officials presented an Oracle partnership as the only way for TikTok to continue operating in the country. In the months after its announcement, the deal was stalled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;a string of successful court challenges&lt;/a&gt; to the August 6th order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wHWf"&gt;If President Biden shifts away from Trump’s aggressive policy toward the app, TikTok would likely continue its US operations without any assistance from Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0chclN"&gt;Biden’s tech policy is still taking shape, but the new president has shown some willingness to continue Trump-era efforts to stem Chinese influence. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist"&gt;incoming Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Congress&lt;/a&gt; that she saw “no reason” to remove Huawei from the Entity List, suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257675/trump-extends-huawei-ban-may-2021-china-us-android-google-telecom"&gt;Trump’s ban on Huawei telecom products&lt;/a&gt; will likely continue under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
