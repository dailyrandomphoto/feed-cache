    <title>Eero now offers its 6 Pro Mesh Wi-Fi in a two-pack</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero Pro 6 now offers a two-pack for purchase, for when you need a little more, but not that much more.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pjYSB6"&gt;As of this week, you can finally pick up a two-pack of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Eero Pro 6 mesh Wi-Fi 6 &lt;/a&gt;routers for under $400. The move by the Amazon-owned company gives you more price-palatable choices for upgrading your existing Wi-Fi router to a faster, more powerful option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wr65uE"&gt;First announced when the Eero Pro 6 launched last year, the two-pack is now available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Feero-pro-6-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-2-pack%2F6477842.p%3FskuId%3D6477842&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (although weirdly not on Eero’s own site). And currently, both sites are offering an extra 20 percent off for Prime and Best Buy members through September 28th. That means for around $320 you can blanket up to a 3,500-square-foot home in speedy Wi-Fi goodness using this tri-band, Wi-Fi 6 mesh router. (The single unit and three-pack also are currently discounted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pMOm"&gt;Previously, your options were a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single Eero Pro 6&lt;/a&gt; to cover 2,000 square feet for $229 or the more-than-most-people-need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-pro-6-3-pack/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack&lt;/a&gt; to cover 6,000 square feet for $599. It has been &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to buy two Eero Pro 6 devices, but not easy. You had to hunt around on Amazon for it, and if you happened to land at BestBuy.com or Eero’s own website, you’d be out of luck or paying $60 more, for two individual Eeros. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfqHrf31jlhJk4nMGa_P0rT6kU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865519/41CL6QZwZaL._SL1001_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two nodes are better than one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rZgAf8"&gt;The Eero two-pack is a great fit for anyone whose living space is somewhere between a studio apartment and a three-bedroom house in the ‘burbs. And of course, Wi-Fi coverage is not just about space. If you’ve got 1,500 square feet segmented by thick, brick walls and you want a wire-free way to spread the speed, an extra node or two will certainly come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwejoH"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 mesh system offers gigabit speed, Wi-Fi 6, and tri-band performance. Its satellite nodes that you place around your home also have two ethernet ports on them, so you can hardwire a TV or games console to one for a more reliable connection without it needing to be in the same room as your modem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUIB2m"&gt;The Eeros also have a Zigbee smart home hub built-in — which you can use to connect select Zigbee devices, including smart lightbulbs, door locks, smart plugs, and smart sensors. While it acts as the hub, you still need the Amazon Alexa app and an Amazon account to set up and manage the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h738jxIjz2kPauKxnnnxmeHoxqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170470/dseifert_201213_4337_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two ethernet ports give you some flexibility with the Eero Pro 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VIm6Y0"&gt;By offering this third price option, the very expensive Eero Pro 6 comes closer to competitors like Asus, with its two-pack &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenWiFi-AX-Whole-Home-Tri-Band/dp/B083Q45V1V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZenWiFi AX Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System&lt;/a&gt; for $450. However, the Asus offers more control over network settings, which the Eero, despite its Pro tag, doesn’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVu4PX"&gt;If the price is still too steep for you, the non-pro Eero 6 routers cost $279 for a three-pack and cover up to 5,000 square feet. But you only get a dual-band setup and recommended speeds top out at 500 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tumblr’s subscription feature is now open to everyone in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Tumblr app screenshots of a blog titled “game over, gamer”. The first shows an introductory post with a list of games and examples of content like reviews and playthroughs. The second shows a Post Plus subscription page that says “subscribe for $1.99/ month, cancel anytime”." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFGq_cdi1HtmsxRGQspBa89cFxM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887944/Gaming_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post Plus for gamer content.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tumblr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="saqKwH"&gt;Tumblr is expanding the beta for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus subscription feature&lt;/a&gt; to all users in the US today. Post Plus, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;Twitter’s Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, allows creators to designate some of their posts as only for paying subscribers. Tumblr is planning a full launch of the feature later in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtwdNP"&gt;Tumblr has made some changes since the limited beta that started in July. Post Plus creators can now directly block people who subscribe to them. Creators previously had to contact Tumblr support if they wanted to block a subscriber, which raised concerns among users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1xmhr"&gt;There’s now an option to set a subscription price to $1.99 a month, in addition to the existing $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 options. Creators can go back and paywall existing content, rather than being limited to only monetizing new posts. Tumblr is also removing the blue plus badge, similar to a Twitter verified badge, that appeared next to creators’ usernames.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Four Tumblr app screenshots showing examples of blogs for beauty tips and gaming. One shows the sign-up page for subscriptions, another shows a post being created, with options to set it for everyone or supporters only. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qqa0G4NVX6OLAol3zAy1JcoS5Vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865611/Group_Shot_29.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tumblr&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Views of Post Plus for subscribers and creators. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SVhjB2"&gt;Tumblr says several of the adjustments to the beta were made in response to user feedback. Predictably, many Tumblr users &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/"&gt;weren’t happy about the initial Post Plus announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Some users even organized a log-off protest, specifically citing concerns about the legality of monetizing fan work, though those concerns likely stem from &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/08/tumblr-post-plus-backlash-controversy-protest-copyright.html"&gt;misunderstandings of copyright law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGomBk"&gt;Many Tumblr creators already link out to their Patreon or Ko-fi accounts, so Post Plus is pitched as a way to support creators without leaving the platform. Tumblr has struggled to build back its user base after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266013/tumblr-porn-ban-lost-users-down-traffic"&gt;mass exodus&lt;/a&gt; that followed the site’s infamous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;2018 porn ban&lt;/a&gt;. According to Tumblr, almost half of its current users are Gen Z, and it hopes monetization features will help attract more young creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAVn8m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UckSp2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntIINp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFT scammers are here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of NFTs falling into a sack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jx3duytUhUypiR7W0oeM_FE5PdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888007/acastro_210914_4753_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Collectors have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of NFTs; sometimes, the community helps claw them back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YerIST"&gt;Last month, Jeff Nicholas popped into the Discord channel for OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, looking for help with a royalties issue. Within minutes, someone by the name of “Pascal | OpenSea” responded, inviting him into a separate Discord called “OpenSea Support Server.” There, he was greeted by “Nate | OpenSea,” given a queue number, and eventually started talking through a resolution process with the two agents. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pascal_OpenSea"&gt;Pascal&lt;/a&gt; is the name of OpenSea’s customer support lead, and Nate might have been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain"&gt;Nate Chastain&lt;/a&gt;, its head of product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677793/opensea-product-chief-resign-nft-insider-trading-accusations"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0Kuse"&gt;But there was no Nate or Pascal, and Nicholas wasn’t in a customer support channel. He’d been targeted by a group of scammers masquerading as OpenSea employees, and they got right to work. Holding Nicholas in customer support purgatory, they would ping him intermittently, telling him his turn was approaching. By online customer service standards, it was typical — good, even, for how personal they were acting. Tailored messages, an exclusive Discord invite, and multiple team members, all working as fast as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mBaX9"&gt;If anything felt off in the conversations, it was that “Nate” kept calling him “my guy.” But between family obligations and customer service exhaustion, Nicholas overlooked the faux pas. After hours of back-and-forth, they casually suggested he share his screen with them. To Nicholas, this was just the next step in the troubleshooting process; for the scammers, their eyes began to glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yoPQbn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the value of NFTs has increased, so too has the threat of scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UCihGm"&gt;Over the next hour, the scammers wiped out NFT apes, cats, and dogs from Nicholas’ wallet. Because he had shared his screen, they were able to snap a picture of the QR code synced to his private key, or “seed phrase,” quietly gaining full access to his assets. To stall Nicholas, the scammers calmly assured him that the royalty payments were arriving, all while frantically transferring his NFTs away. When his suspicions finally blew over, it was already far too late. The damage totaled about 150 ETH, or roughly $480,000. Soon after he was scammed, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jeffnicholas_/status/1430067809321590788"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out a single word: “Fuck.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1xc40"&gt;As the value of NFTs have increased overall, with certain projects being considered “blue chip” due to high or relatively stable valuations, so too has the threat of scammers. In the NFT space, the word “scam” covers many bases. It can refer to a project whose team &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/fame-lady-squad-nft-women-men-scandal-scam"&gt;rakes in millions off false&lt;/a&gt; promises to buyers, also known as a “rug pull”; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keeganft/status/1436647583368187915?s=20"&gt;fake Twitter giveaways&lt;/a&gt; of NFTs that farm retweets and followers to give the illusion of clout; and malicious links or persuasive impostors that result in the user unknowingly giving up their private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSPFjq"&gt;It seems almost paradoxical that a space whose users are generally fluent in traditional cybersecurity can become victims so easily. But in the NFT space, where a culture of community, vibes, and clicking fast on good deals rule, it is the socially-minded scams that are the most compelling. Scammers, whose ploys all depend on gaining a victim’s trust, exploit the same instincts that make the NFT space more a tight-knit community of friends than an assemblage of individual traders. In this climate, Nicholas calls these scams a kind of “social engineering:” conditioning someone to think they are dealing with a friend or trusted community member so that they let their guard down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SFRSHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It takes focus to be like, ‘I am my own bank, and I am the custodian of my own money.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGpI0L"&gt;The scam used on Nicholas is arguably the most nefarious. If a scammer has control of a user’s keys, they are able to transfer any crypto asset into a separate wallet. All transactions are irreversible by design. If a user immediately realizes their wallet has been compromised, it’s a frenzied race to transfer the most valuable assets into an uncompromised one. In Nicholas’ case, even though he had secured his account with an additional layer of protection — a hardware device that requires him to sign off on transactions — he had been manipulated into thinking he was authorizing royalty payments, and his NFTs quickly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi2155"&gt;Because a blockchain like Ethereum is decentralized and allows for anonymity, it is difficult to track down scammers who use anonymous wallets, and victims have few avenues for recourse. “It takes focus to be like, ‘I am my own bank, and I am the custodian of my own money,’” Nicholas said. “I can’t just go through it like when I go to the bank and I’m distracted on my phone. You have to be 100 percent in the moment. Otherwise it’s very easy to miss some signs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbONV2"&gt;On the other hand, the blockchain is transparent: every transaction can be tracked, whether or not the destination is anonymous. In the recent case where community cybersleuths discovered that an OpenSea employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;traded NFTs on insider information&lt;/a&gt;, the unsettling transactions connected back to the employee’s publicly known account; in Nicholas’ case, the scammers’ wallets and the stolen assets remained fully visible, but could reveal nothing about the new owner’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NNw3V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NFT community has begun to develop a scam-response playbook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMbXOg"&gt;This meant that while the scammers themselves eluded identification, OpenSea could still identify the scammer’s wallet address. Upon being informed, they were obligated to “lock” the stolen NFTs, preventing them from being traded or resold. But by the time they locked Nicholas’ assets, the scammers had preemptively sold them off to the highest bidders, none of whom knew they were participating in the exchange of stolen goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKYZhR"&gt;This put Nicholas into a double bind. Despite the crushing blow of losing six figures of assets, which included the Bored Ape he used as his Twitter identity, he had to, as he says, “make buyers whole” since they had collectively spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on NFTs that were suddenly unsellable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EunQj5"&gt;The NFT community has begun to develop a playbook to deal with the fallout from scams, which involves raising funds to buy back stolen and flipped goods. This typically includes community fundraising, where generous users donate excess Ethereum or in-demand NFTs, while artists often pitch in with NFTs they’ve created themselves. Oftentimes, victims are given zero-interest cryptocurrency loans, which they can use to invest or start their own artistic projects to get back on their feet. Rescue bots with names like “Cool Cats Rescue” and “dogemaster42069” patrol the marketplace, making automatic lowball offers to liquidity-starved scammers so the NFTs can be returned to the original owners at fairer prices — and sometimes for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CoolCatRescue/status/1421205215408177156?s=20"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bB9xdW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My stolen items ended up in innocent buyers’ wallets and are now locked.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gla6s9"&gt;Nicholas connected with Sohrob Farudi, an NFT collector &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sohrobf/status/1430478533306982408?s=20"&gt;who’d lost&lt;/a&gt; what he estimated was 250 ETH, or $800,000, after scammers had deceived him by impersonating the Bored Ape Yacht Club founders. Together they started a community fund to buy back the stolen NFTs that had been frozen. By raising NFTs from the community, they were able to resell the donations for roughly 10 percent of the value of the stolen assets, or a still-impressive sum of 32 ETH. The rest has come out of their own pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stxwGZ"&gt;“I felt horrible that something that happened to me impacted all these other people. It isn’t fair that my stolen items ended up in innocent buyers’ wallets and are now locked,” Farudi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkvw2R"&gt;While the fund has reunited Nicholas and Farudi with some of their prized assets, the process has not all been easy. Soon after the scammers sold the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the perceived market value skyrocketed on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount"&gt;a Sotheby’s auction announcement&lt;/a&gt; and an expansion of the Bored Ape ecosystem called “Mutants.” While most buyers returned the NFTs at cost, some ape buyers were not willing to return their inflated NFTs for what they paid. After significant negotiation, Nicholas and Farudi were able to settle with the large majority of the buyers. One ape remains. “We may have to just let it go,” Nicholas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rF78PP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenSea has since added an SOS button&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GA5Ai"&gt;Despite the stereotype of a cryptocurrency space subject to highly-complicated hacks, such as when an anonymous hacker &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/10/more-than-600-million-stolen-in-ethereum-and-other-cryptocurrencies-marking-one-of-cryptos-biggest-hacks-ever/?sh=535b8bd87f62"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; over $600 million in cryptocurrency (and later returned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/poly-network-hacker-returns-remaining-cryptocurrency.html"&gt;all of it&lt;/a&gt;), the scams used on Nicholas and Farudi were verifiably low-tech. There was no venomous code; it was fake Discord channels and fake names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc4jMN"&gt;In response to the two high-profile scams, OpenSea has apologized to Nicholas and Farudi. The platform also added an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain/status/1435226364681011203?s=20"&gt;SOS button&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to lock their own account should they believe it to be compromised. MetaMask, the wallet service Nicholas used, has temporarily &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain/status/1430607237165223940?s=20"&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt; the QR code which gives access to a user’s keys, since scammers have exploited the feature through victims’ screen share function on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColeThereum/status/1430564716410286081?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; occasions. While Discord has some security features to prevent impersonation, such as unique four-digit number tags on top of a non-unique username system, some users feel that the latter still enables opportunities for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3YFjH"&gt;For Nicholas and Farudi, their lives were upended in a matter of hours. Nicholas compared the feeling to PTSD, and Farudi says the psychological trauma has made him paranoid whenever he clicks on his MetaMask. If anything could have brought them back into the space, it was the social connections that drew them in the first place. “It’s a story centered in community. This bad thing happened and the community rallied,” Nicholas told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There are so many people who have reached out and said, ‘Look, the same thing happened to me. And I’ve been ashamed, and I haven’t said anything. And I didn’t do anything about it because I know better.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tSoAoc"&gt;“If this is what it took to close a vulnerability, and now other people won’t suffer the same fate,” Farudi added, “I feel good that we went out and did what we did.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Fuck You Pay Me is empowering creators</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Information is power&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CBZzt7"&gt;We talk a lot about the creator economy here on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; — the booming business of individuals using social platforms to build audiences and then finding ways to monetize those audiences, mostly through subscriptions or advertising. There are a lot of players in that game: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637871/doug-demuro-car-reviews-youtube-decoder-interview"&gt;we’ve talked to the creators&lt;/a&gt; about how they make money, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22174582/decoder-podcast-interview-cadillac-cmo-melissa-grady-advertising"&gt;we’ve talked to CEOs and CMOs&lt;/a&gt; about how they’re spending their ad dollars, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview"&gt;we’ve talked to a lot of executives from social platforms&lt;/a&gt; on how they see all of this growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdlAWT"&gt;One thing I’ve learned from all those conversations is that the creator economy is a market just like any other, with supply and demand, but that it’s also a market that is absolutely starved of information. So today I’m talking to Lindsey Lee Lugrin, the co-founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.fypm.vip/"&gt;a new platform called Fuck You Pay Me&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time great company name. FYPM is an app for creators to review and compare brand deals: what brands are paying, what it’s like to work with them, and whether people would work with them again. It’s kind of like Yelp or Glassdoor for influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QikNNZ"&gt;Lindsey’s an interesting founder — she has a master’s in finance and was an equity analyst at an investment firm. But she was also a freelance model and influencer, and she’s used that network to build FYPM’s user base. The company is still just two people, Lindsey and her co-founder Isha Mehra, but they just secured their first pre-seed venture funding and they’re looking to hire and grow. So in addition to talking about the creator economy, Lindsey and I talked about growing her startup and how she’s planning to scale — after all, right now, she’s reviewing all the user signups herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4TgnU"&gt;Here’s Lindsey Lee Lugrin, CEO and co-founder of Fuck You Pay Me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpztfl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YUH608"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4378410912" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eTbTTB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L02DVF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toBnJ2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Lee Lugrin, you are the CEO and co-founder of an app called Fuck You Pay Me, which is a delightful name. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HR6DB6"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVZJUa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. What is Fuck You Pay Me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfloPi"&gt;We call Fuck You Pay Me a Glassdoor for influencers. Right now, that means if a brand reaches out to you about a sponsored post on any social media platform, you can look them up on our website and see how much they paid other creators for similar types of sponsored posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRMnRr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire creator economy runs on branded content advertising integration, and there’s a whole background economy to it. If you’re an influencer on an app like Instagram or TikTok or something and I’ve got a product I want to sell, I can reach out to you, I say, “Hey, will you feature my product?” and then the two parties negotiate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64N1rF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re trying to create transparency around the rates for that integration. The purpose of your site is to create or expose the rate card for influencer marketing, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lVnZu"&gt;Really, the purpose is to help creators evaluate the opportunity cost of partnering with a particular brand. Because you can always partner with a different brand, or another, better option is always to invest in your own personal brand. So, it’s just helping them answer the questions: “Is this $400 they’re offering me for this one Instagram post actually worth my time? Are they going to take forever to pay me? Is it going to be a good experience? Are they going to make me redo it a hundred times before it happens?” Because that is absolutely something that happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcDdVK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So “Is it worth your time?” is a really good frame, and then “Are they going to pay me?” is another good frame. So, tell me about the name Fuck You Pay Me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf0jPe"&gt;Well, I didn’t want there to be any misunderstanding of exactly who this was for. There are a lot of websites out there who connect brands and influencers, and you go to the website and you see, “Influencers, log in here; brands, log in here.” They’re all named the same super-techie type thing, and at the end of the day we all know who those platforms are for. So, I named it Fuck You Pay Me because it would be absolutely clear that this was for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys0gR6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. You have been a creator yourself. Give me a sense of how you ended up founding the app, and tell us about your co-founder as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAN4Gl"&gt;I’ve had this idea for about a decade. I actually created the first PowerPoint for it three years ago when I was in grad school. It’s really funny, it was very crypto-based, smart contracts, because it was more focused on the freelancer side. I started off as a freelance model, and had the same problems as creators. You feel like you’re looking into a black box when considering taking on a new client or taking a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73Cd7M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, hold on. Sorry, you said model. You were a model, that’s what you mean? Not the model for the company was freelance. You were a freelance model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ulxyh"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvJGX1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, just making it clear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9kGxD"&gt;Yes. Actually in 2015, I won the #CastMeMarc Instagram contest where I was one of 11 people chosen out of over 750,000 people to be the face of Marc by Marc Jacobs, and I was on billboards all over the world, I was in magazines, I was on shopping bags. It was crazy. And I only got paid $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68K4QI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you serious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJVZYZ"&gt;Yes, and to this day, that was my highest-paid gig. On paper I looked super successful. I was sold as wall art in Urban Outfitters, I was in Italian &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, I did New York Fashion Week. I was in &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine. The list goes on and on and on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azCiV6"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Both &lt;/em&gt;New York &lt;em&gt;Magazine and The Verge are divisions of Vox Media. &lt;/em&gt;New York&lt;em&gt; Magazine was acquired by Vox Media in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="UF5xH7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRjCWr"&gt;But the fundamental principle is, it’s really hard to get paid and it’s really hard to decide if this is the opportunity you should take. Back in the day the thought was “Oh, this giant brand could make or break my career as a freelance X.” I say freelance X because all of my photographer friends, makeup artists, all creative freelancers have the same problem. We talk about this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oq5Ji2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there’s a backchannel of freelancers in the creative community who are talking about rates, who are talking about what it’s like to work with various companies and agencies, and your thinking is, “I’m going to use crypto to make it better.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cxx45E"&gt;That was the old thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ugyye"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. I appreciate that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY5JDD"&gt;Yeah, we’re trying to figure out where exactly crypto comes into our current model. I do think there is a spot for it, but right now, most of our users and customers need cash. So this is an ongoing discussion I’m having with my co-founder. There’s absolutely a place for it, especially with &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/"&gt;Ethereum smart contracts&lt;/a&gt; and all that stuff.  We also don’t want the value to be view-based, because a lot of the things that go into brand deals, which is what we’re focused on now, you get higher rates for usage rights, terms, whitelisting, stuff like that. There’s a lot that goes into it. It’s not just about audience size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdRLfp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your first MVP [minimum viable product], I was just doing some reading before you came on the show, your first version of this, you just built using a bunch of consumer SaaS products like Airtable. How did that go, and then how did you end up with a co-founder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2cVUE"&gt;I’ve had this idea for forever. At the beginning of the pandemic, I lost my job in marketing, and I lost all my money, my relationship, and my house within the six months after I lost my job. I moved back in with my parents and I decided, screw it, I’m going to build this website I’ve always wanted to exist, because it probably could have prevented this from happening in the first place. I started off by sending it to all of my friends who are also bloggers and creators, and asking, “Hey, would you sign up for this website?” Ninety-nine percent of the response was like, “Yes, absolutely. Finally. I’ve been waiting for this to exist.” That’s how it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxqmCR"&gt;I hacked together the first version using Typeform and Airtable. The Typeform survey actually took about 40 minutes to fill out, which is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iz9Ryz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ol4mEP"&gt;Yeah, and I used my marketing skills to build out the brand page, and through that, we got natural user growth, natural press, and I hacked my way into an actual hacker fellowship for engineers because I was the only non-engineer they let in. At that hacker fellowship I met my co-founder, Isha Mehra. She’s fucking amazing. She used to work at Facebook as a data scientist, but she quit because she wanted to do something more to help people to use data for good. Basically, she quit around the time the election was happening, and she built software to help people request mail-in ballots for the 2020 election. She raised money for it, she hired 40 people. She’s the OG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAddhh"&gt;So together in Taiwan — this fellowship was also in Taiwan — we rebuilt the whole website. It still works similarly to how it worked before: you sign up, you tell us who you are so we can make sure you are who you say you are and verify your review, and you have to leave a review. So the rule is you have to contribute to be a part of the community, and then after that, we approve you and you can see what everyone else has to say about different brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WigqyZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say we, it’s just you and your co-founder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTlTJO"&gt;Yes, yes. Right now it’s just me and my co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFUU7e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many approvals do you do a day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMZTVo"&gt;Right now, with minimal marketing, we get about 40 people a day who try to sign up, and it varies how many we approve. Actually, this next year is about streamlining our onboarding process and creating a platform that’s very sticky and that can scale. Right now it’s still me manually checking out everyone who tries to sign up and manually uploading every review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu1EHD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems like a lot. How long does it take you to review one person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcZVkY"&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga7p98"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m assuming for most people, they end their day with the decision, “I’m going to watch trash TV.” I have a picture in my head where at the end of your day you’re like, “Well, time to look at approvals.” You’ve got a stack of 40. How long does that take you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1lbh8"&gt;Oh. Well, most of them haven’t filled out all the parts right now, so it doesn’t take me very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GJyDm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, that’s the interesting part of being a founder, right? You’re doing all the jobs down to making sure people filled out the form correctly to sign up for the platform. How do you expect that to scale? Is the problem that you’re doing it alone and you want to make that time shorter? Will adding people help? Can you, I don’t know, do some AI thing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR9xYV"&gt;Well, this is what we’re working on right now. Step one is finding good people who can help us scale. We’re going to build out our engineering team and our product. Isha and I have a lot of conversations about, is this a product problem or a marketing problem? My view is I really think that marketing isn’t an add-on, it’s something you design and build within your product from the ground up. So, when I’m thinking about this next year, I really want to hire a content assistant to help us repurpose content and keep up the audience while we focus on product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0T6ta"&gt;Our first way to scale, because a big reason this whole thing works is that it’s anonymous internally, and our users trust us because they know going into it that only other people within the same community are allowed inside. So we’re trying to come up with a system that allows some sort of connection to your social accounts for instant limited access that gives them a tease of the preview, and then they have to leave a review before they’re allowed to see everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69GmBx"&gt;So, thinking about just putting together what I’ve learned through approving people and disapproving people, there’s lots of little things that fake people do, and things that legit people do, and just building that into the tech in a safe way, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2FHwp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I asked about scale because it leads me into the exciting news that I want to talk about. You just raised your first pre-seed round of funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajinYi"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rasCuP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQL4Zl"&gt;Yes, we did. We just raised $1.35 million, and we’re super excited about it. We can hire people and build out our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqDXxA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t see Lindsey, but she’s grinning. Congratulations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XC2dja"&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrueB9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re obviously very excited about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cp8FNX"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cv1MeR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you got your first little bit of pre-seed money. What are you going to spend it on? What’s the first set of priorities for that cash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Vcao"&gt;Product is the number one thing we’re focused on this next year. And to me, that means building out our engineering team, which includes a full stack software engineer, a UX/UI designer, and a content director who can help us repurpose our existing viral content, not only onto Instagram but other platforms, and keep our community growing and talking to each other while we figure out how to bring that community onto our platform. And I firmly believe that marketing is integrated into the best type of products out there. So we have a lot of discussions about the right type of people to build this out and how to integrate the two functions. I learned a lot through my experience in equity research, talking to CEOs and picking stocks, and especially within the consumer space on how viewing different parts of the organization separately kind of creates conflict and not synergies. So I’m taking an integrated approach to hiring and product as a whole. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSgSjX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. Absolutely. I think one of the really interesting things about that is you’re still looking at the social platforms for user acquisition. So you’re a service for creators, but you kind of have the same challenges as creators where you want to be diversified on platforms. I just want to understand that a little bit. Why do you think your user acquisition still happens on the platforms themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBSnGv"&gt;Well, the platforms, they change every quarter. No two brand deals are the same. We really centered our product around brand deals because a lot of these deals occur across multiple platforms. That’s something I think our competitors are doing wrong is they’re focusing on average price for Instagram posts or average price for TikTok videos. And that doesn’t capture all of the nuances within these brand deals. It doesn’t capture your relative value of celebrity. And we want to create something that incorporates all those nuances, because that’s how creators think. When you’re approached by a brand, a brand wants you for a reason. If they wanted an Instagram post, they could just take out an ad. If they wanted a TikTok video, they could take out an ad. But there’s a reason why they’re picking you over the ads on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmFDqB"&gt;So really this is about integrating all those nuances and making it make sense to our users. So right now our website is just a basic review site. And it’s closed because our community knows all these other nuances that can go in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQMvyU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So just real quick, so people have an understanding. Tell me, if I’m an influencer, how does a brand deal work, start to finish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RjGd7"&gt;It really depends. If you are like me and you’re a niche, micro-influencer, typically the brand will email you or DM you on whatever social platform you’re on and say, “Hey, we love your work. We’d love to collab,” and keep the ball in your court. You can either accept immediately if you’re excited to get the deal, or you can say, “My rates are X, Y, and Z for X, Y, and Z.” And then they either say yes, they negotiate, or they say, “No, we just wanted to pay for product.” If you have a manager, you divert them to your manager. Or you can go through a PR company, or you can go through one of these third-party platforms that connects brands to influencers. There’s literally no rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeLnWf"&gt;And that’s a big reason why we centered it around the brand because we’re collecting data on which platform or which method gets you the best deal. So far, people who have managers always have the best outcome for themselves. Because they know how to talk numbers, how to talk marketing-speak, and how to increase your rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5Afm2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll tell you my favorite story about one of my friends who’s an influencer getting a manager. He literally didn’t have a manager. He just asked his brother to start replying to his emails saying, “I’ll do it for slightly more money.” And he doubled his revenue for the year. He was like, “It felt rude for me to do it. So I just had my brother do it.” And it was just like, “Yes, but I’ll do it for 20 percent more.” And because it felt professional, the rates went up. There’s just an aspect of not wanting to be the bad person yourself and just offloading that to someone else and making that a little more sterile and less personal that I think works really well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3vDd7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there’s no rules there. If you’re a smaller influencer the brands reach out to you. There’s a flip side to it, right, where you start pitching yourself. When does that start happening for people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd3lJV"&gt;When you start pitching yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eo75K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. If you’re one of the biggest influencers on the platform, right now you’ve got an army of agents and publicists and managers and they go out looking for deals from the biggest companies. Does that only happen for the biggest folks or do the mid-tier influencers get those opportunities as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLKtdC"&gt;Well, define “biggest folks” first. Are we talking about audience size?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgUTHk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the expert. You tell me. I’m thinking of the most famous influencers in the game. The D’Amelios have a show on Hulu, right? It seems like they’re not waiting for the deals to come to them anymore. They’ve got an army of people who are proactively seeking ways to exploit their reach. Is that reserved for that category, or is there a number of followers or reach or influence you can have? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNvGQq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the flip for me personally would be, I wouldn’t want to build a channel where I’m constantly dependent on other people coming to me with money, but I’ve built a product that I can practically go and sell and create stability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ske0Ix"&gt;Yeah. Brand deals are inherently unstable. A lot of the time these are one-off gigs. So that plays into it. I think once you get to the type of scale you’re referring to, your choices are drastically different. You can be a lot pickier with brands. And a lot of the time you shouldn’t do a brand deal, but then again, everything’s personal. Also right now we have a lot of brand deals, at least from our manager portal. The first version of the site I created, I just had myself in mind. I manage and negotiate my own brand deals. But now we have a manager portal. So managers can sign up, sign the influencers up they work with, and leave reviews and search reviews and all that. But we have a lot of people who are traditional celebrities, like a 50-year-old Food Network star. His manager signed up and he only has 15,000 followers on Instagram, but he’s a huge celebrity. His situation is obviously completely different than someone who’s starting from the ground up as a normal person who has 15,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pBq0Jx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Brand deals are inherently unstable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="htmn9h"&gt;It’s a hard question. These are all the questions we’re trying to answer. It’s just there’s so much data and they’re in so many different places. So there’s not really a point because everyone is so different, and that’s why we’re focusing on helping people build the context around someone else’s experience. Eventually in the future I think it’d be cool to allow people to reveal more information about themselves on the platform to their community and maybe build in some sort of influence within the platform. That would be cool. But we’re being very careful about how we approach that because it’s just very early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGMsd3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I ask is because the creator marketplace — this whole social platform, brand deal economy — it’s really early and no one knows how it works. And I think there’s a lot of pressure. There’s a lot of people out there who are very eager to tell you they know how it works. But it still seems inherently unstable to me and pretty risky, because I couldn’t tell you how much anything should cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sP8Qgn"&gt;Exactly. And that’s why we’re never going to tell anyone how much they should charge, because inevitably you can’t do that at scale. Everyone is different. You can’t accurately capture that in a way that is for the benefit of the creator. People just want information to make better decisions about themselves or their clients because absolutely, once you get to a certain scale, like what you were talking about at the macro-influencer level, it is better for you to outsource that and have someone managing deals for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk1C4w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things we always talk about with the platforms is how their content policies affect what gets made. So YouTube, I think, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is most famous for changing their policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. They decide, “We don’t want any more prank videos.” And then all of those YouTubers had to become like family vloggers. And then YouTube was like, “This is getting creepy,” and they turned that down. And then everyone moved on to something else. Do you see that same kind of influence from the money side where brands want different kinds of integrations, different kinds of things that shape what gets made?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He1Mwd"&gt;Absolutely. And for the most part, those types of deals are the ones that get the negative reviews. Actually, on that note, only 11 percent of our reviews are negative; 52 percent are positive. The rest are neutral. But creative freedom is absolutely something that leads to a positive review because at the end of the day, it goes back to what I said earlier. If you’re a brand and you want someone to create content for you in a specific way, you should just hire a pure content creator, not someone who’s also trying to build their own personal brand in this space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMCEgl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, say I’m a micro-influencer on TikTok — which is my destiny, I have to be honest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85GDQA"&gt;Define micro-influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H461Ki"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know. That’s just a word I want to use. So I’m a midsize influencer on TikTok. And I don’t know who’s going to come up to me, maybe Shell Oil is going to roll up to me and say, “I want a post.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL5xPQ"&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be3vCv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not? And I’m going to go onto Fuck You Pay Me and I’m going to look up Shell Oil. And I’m going to see a bunch of reviews that are like, they underpay. They pay late. They want more than what you could get if you just did a campaign with Banana Republic or whatever, some more traditional influencer marketing agency. And I would say, “No, this isn’t worth my time.” Is that kind of the flow you’re looking at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly7L9q"&gt;Yeah, absolutely. Right now a big reason people come to our website is to just check on brands. It’s the only thing out there that exists where they can check. Everyone’s curious, because you don’t know. You’re like, oh, they offered me $1,000. To me, that’s a lot. But to the brand who makes $400 million a year, that’s negligible. And they just want to know if they’ve gotten screwed. But hopefully how our existing users will use it in the future is: They get approached by a brand. They’re considering taking on a job. They go onto our website and they just want to see other people’s experience. And you can filter by platform, by the brand industry, the country — that makes a big difference. Also, the niche of the influencer. We found that meme pages and petfluencers tend to really undersell themselves, which is interesting and also might make sense considering there’s not a human likeness attached to it. Yeah. It’s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sghNB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that you mentioned that I kind of want to dig on is, you said it sometimes it’s better to just invest in yourself and your own content. You have been a creator yourself and we talk to creators on the show all the time, but it occurred to me that you only have so many hours in a day. And you have to invest those hours in the day towards whatever you think is going to get you the most value. And some of that time is just spent, I don’t know, billing and invoicing and trying to collect. But some of it is spent making ads, content for other people. Some of it’s spent making content for yourself. What’s the balance? How much does it have to be worth for you to take a deal versus invest in your own growth on your page organically? Because that seems like the central tension here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFg7Nm"&gt;Exactly. It’s a personal decision. Everyone is different. Every brand deal is different and that’s what our platform does. It helps people put into context other people’s experiences with brands and see how relevant it is to you and your personal situation, which changes over time and changes with how you evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v9HV5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you said you were an Excel whiz before. I imagine, I can envision an Excel spreadsheet that’s like, here’s my rate per hour. Here’s the value in follower growth or subscriber growth or whatever if I make great organic content. And as various numbers about my social accounts change and grow, you can write an Excel formula that spits out a dollar amount for what you should charge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sevEGg"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm8LQP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t do it that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="su28CQ"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phwNjl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s just how my brain works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="699nRa"&gt;Yeah, yeah, no. That’s how a lot of people in business and tech’s brains work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQLCuD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderously dunked on, on my own show.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1Xro2"&gt;No, no, no. Sorry. That’s fine, but that’s not necessarily how a creator’s brain works. And that’s why we will never try to tell anybody how much they should charge. There are a lot of platforms out there that do that. That is not our business. That is not why people come here. People come here for information. People come here to hear other people’s experiences within their community. And they come here to evaluate or get more context behind, “is this worth my time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wwm7Dr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will never try to tell anybody how much they should charge. There are a lot of platforms out there that do that. That is not our business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="um8EnF"&gt;So also this next year, it’s not just about streamlining onboarding. It’s about helping our users put into context what these other people’s reviews mean. We want to build out the brand pages. A lot of that involves putting into plain English what their finances mean, if they’re a public company, if their brand is part of a larger parent company, how much money they make. Are they a startup? Have they gotten funding? What are they prioritizing? How relevant is their brand to your personal brand? Because if you’re going to accept an ambassadorship, which is a commitment to a particular brand for a long period of time, how much does that benefit you versus them? So it’s an art and a science. And everything else out there captures more the science part. And we capture the art part, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlhbMR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. That’s really interesting. And that’s because of your focus on just the creators, right? You’re not trying to build some two-sided marketplace where you’re finding deals for both sides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctuUdU"&gt;Absolutely. Absolutely. Right now, we’re focused on providing value to our users and then how to monetize will come later. Through the Instagram page, it’s a constant feedback loop. They tell us every day what they like, what they don’t like, what they want, what they’d be willing to pay for. Being connected to brands is not something on the top of their list. So we just raised a pre-seed round and we are hyperfocused on delivering value to our users. And I think the clear monetization plan will come later. I have a couple of ideas. But right now being connected to brands is not something they’re asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cmhIg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brands will find you on social media, that much seems clear. When you were out raising this pre-seed round, were investors focused on monetization or was it, build the product, make it good, get users and we’ll figure it out later?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTqV0j"&gt;The ones we accepted money from were, build a product, make it good, and figure it out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpdH3K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me a hint. You said you had some ideas. What’s the shape of those ideas to monetize?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0C7xL"&gt;Yeah. So we have a couple of ideas. One, the most obvious idea, is to charge our users a subscription or a tiered subscription to access the data. I personally don’t want to do that. I would like to keep access open for the people who need it the most and explore more the research side, in aggregate of course. Everybody wants to know about the creator economy right now. Figuring out the TAM of this industry was a huge challenge I faced and a huge challenge everyone knows. And a lot of these brand deals—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hoYdG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait. TAM is total addressable market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVdeHT"&gt;Yes. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGXq4N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s clear you have only been talking to investors. I’m just making sure I know what you’re talking about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps5ymG"&gt;Oh, yes. Yeah. Sorry. Total addressable market. It’s the market size. And it’s a difficult question to answer because most of these brand deals occur under the table and they occur under the table for a reason. And we are really the only place that is capturing the broad scope of where these deals are happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZkNmX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do you think the total addressable market is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJksgC"&gt;That’s a good question. That’s a really good question. That’s actually exactly what we’re trying to figure out right now. And we are at a super early stage. Honestly, I think it’s in the trillions. Yeah. If I had to give a number, that’s what I would say. It’s huge. Yeah. That is the question we’re trying to answer honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9agTQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you think that’s the total creator economy, the amount of money flowing into creators and through platforms in some way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKCger"&gt;Not through platforms, through brand deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69pQIn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I ask is because &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637871/doug-demuro-car-reviews-youtube-decoder-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we had Doug DeMuro on the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – he’s a very popular auto YouTuber – and I asked him, how do you make money? And I was expecting the long list of creator economy revenue sources, brand deals, merch, the whole thing. And he said, “No, I just use YouTube Preferred.” And the platform takes a cut and provides midroll advertising on his videos and that’s his whole money. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbrHbo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think Instagram would like to become a shopping mall and just take a cut of everything that you buy in Instagram — I don’t think it, I know it, as I watch Instagram evolve. It is becoming a shopping app in a very direct way. That is the other side of it. The platforms want to broker the deals. They want to connect the brands to the influencers. They want to run the ads. They want to eventually become the commerce destination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOI716"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you see the kind of deals that you are focused on playing in that larger ecosystem? Does it become a larger part of that whole ecosystem? Do the platforms threaten the smaller brand deals? How do you see that shaping out over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imt7D8"&gt;Well, you can’t control what people do. You can only try to convince them that it’s their own idea. So if, for both parties, there’s a better outcome to occur outside of a third-party platform, that’s what’s going to happen. I think that there is a place for platforms to capture brand deals. I think that occurs more at the macro level, not the micro level. And I think with what we’re building, convincing micro-influencers to just do the platform will be a hard sell, I guess. I think there’s a combo of both because there’s also different types of marketing, too. What you’re describing is essentially affiliate sales. And that doesn’t capture the entire scope of brand deals. In a long-term partnership, you’re attaching your face to a name. And that includes a lot more terms than just how much it translates into sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5gimm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So that’s in the sort of classic marketing funnel, you’re talking about brand advertising, not direct conversion to sales, which is Google Ads or whatever. You think that influencers are going to stay way at the top, at sort of the brand level, not at the click-to-buy level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyrzWv"&gt;If you’re a niche micro-influencer, a lot of the time these affiliate deals aren’t going to be the biggest source of your income because of the cap on your audience size. So it would be better for you to invest in your personal brand and building your audience then taking on that partnership because that takes a lot of time. And that takes away time from you creating content for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFq8Bs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I’m just reading your stats right now. You have 1,500 creators on your platform with more than 2,000 reviews of 1,300 brands. That’s a pretty healthy dataset. What have you learned? What platforms pay the most money to creators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQYgXu"&gt;Well, right now it’s Instagram. But that might be very much a function of all of our marketing being done organically on Instagram. Probably 80 percent of our reviews are for Instagram collaboration. It’s also a function of Instagram being kind of a legacy model for brand deals. It started there and in my opinion, brands go where the eyeballs go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D5vHv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were actually &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/technology/fypm-creators-app-pay.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profiled in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by our friend Taylor Lorenz. Every time I’ve talked to Taylor, she’s said, “Look, YouTube is still a gold standard for influencers. They all want successful YouTube channels. That’s where the most money is.” Compare YouTube to Instagram. You said Instagram, I think it’s pretty funny to think that we’re at a point where we can describe Instagram as a legacy platform. But I think that’s true. That’s the most built-out. It’s the hardest to crack into at this point. Compare it to YouTube and TikTok. How are you seeing the brands shift their spend? And how are you seeing the influencers react to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa1zuJ"&gt;Yeah. Well, again, most of our users come from Instagram, so most of our brand deals are from Instagram. When I listen to a lot of tech people talk about the rise of TikTok, a lot of them are focused on shortform video. They’re like, “This is what people want, blah, blah, blah.” And what I see is that creators go to TikTok because they know that they can build their audiences really, really fast. And then they tell their giant TikTok audiences to follow them on Instagram because that’s where they can get their brand deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgoVj2"&gt;So it’s kind of this cross-platform play. It’s like, where do you grow? Because brand deals are always to some aspect dependent on your audience size and where the deals are happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7bxG6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What categories are the most lucrative? I always imagine that it’s like tech and fashion, but I actually have no idea. That’s just my guess.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNHNQH"&gt;Well, tech, in terms of brand deals, is one of the most lucrative. Honestly, there’s a strong correlation between industries — the more men there are in an industry, typically they get paid more. But again, this is an incomplete dataset. It’s very much a function of the fact that most of our brand deal information comes from Instagram, from micro-influencers who don’t know even to ask to charge money or to charge more for things like usage rights, exclusivity, whitelisting, stuff that traditional media people adjust the price for. It’s a learning thing, but yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wnPuX"&gt;Also a lot of tech influencers — this is another thing, I’m going to go off on a tangent — a lot of business and tech influencers are business and tech influencers because they have another job. They’re a CEO or they’re a VC or something crazy. And they don’t necessarily need the money. So they charge a premium to put their name on the line with this brand. You know what I’m saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TstJdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not worth it for them because they’ve got a day job or whatever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYyP4Q"&gt;Exactly. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyAKKo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you said, if more men are in an industry, typically they get paid more. Can you talk more about that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJ4AZ5"&gt;I’ll clarify that. Every inequity you can imagine that happens in the traditional business world is absolutely amplified in this world because of the lack of transparency. It’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QVtIZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned it with gender. Do you see it with race as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knC1Qa"&gt;Yes. Race, gender, sexual orientation. We want to collect disability, but there’s some term we’re not sure with. You have to be a health care company to collect that data or something. We’re still trying to sort that out. But yeah, the trend so far, there’s no rules, there’s no transparency. The platforms are, inherently, they have bias baked into their platforms. And a lot of these brand deals are based on audience size. And if the platform is going to dock you for not being a normal white heterosexual male, that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TYPXY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It filters all the way down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcW2nd"&gt;Exactly. Yeah. And we are absolutely collecting all that data and we’re not going to hide it from our creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vke5TD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s fascinating. I’m very eager to see the results of that as you grow and how you use that information because I think that’d be a big help for everybody.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2BRTv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people sign up for Fuck You Pay Me, do they have to tell you, “Hey, I’m an influencer on Instagram. Hey, this is my TikTok page.” Do you go vet that they have the audience size that they’re claiming they do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgytxG"&gt;Yes, absolutely. That’s a lot of what I do. It’s like nobody gets through, unless we check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WtueE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a threshold? If I’ve just started, can I show up and sign up for your platform or do I need to have a successful page with brand deals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhz38f"&gt;You need to be able to contribute, so you have to have a brand to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZE9Poc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And do you have any content moderation guidelines? Can I swear at companies? Can I anonymize who they are? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qofjv"&gt;Yeah. Once you’re approved, you can say whatever the hell you want. And that’s just because this is for creators, but at this stage, it’s still me manually uploading every single review. So in the future, we want to give people special permissions. If they’re a super trusted user, they can just go for it and it will be uploaded. And then help create something that allows members of the community to report specific reviews if they seem fishy and whatever, but the new creators right now, they can’t get in. And that’s something we’re hyperfocused on improving our process for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prr0Xq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So do you know who everybody is? You’re checking their handles. So if I’m posting a review and some brand, Nordstrom, is mad at me, can they come yell at you and have that person removed? I mean, this is like the Yelp problem, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SK20mU"&gt;Can Nordstrom come yell at me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4KI4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know. Some brand, if they find out they’ve been reviewed negatively on your site, can they come and find out who the person leaving negative reviews are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC1hX2"&gt;Nordstrom can’t sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iKX0x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEIRKe"&gt;So it would have to be someone within the community who’s already been approved who’s secretly working for Nordstrom. We know who checks out every brand page. We would quickly get a list. And then it probably wouldn’t be that difficult to figure out who that person was and kick them out. So, in the unlikely event that that occurred, I guess that could happen, but that’s why we keep it a closed community, because there’s less incentive to skew positive in your review or skew negative. What’s the point of lying to your own community about their experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8lQIU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I just want to push on the anonymity thing. So you sign up, you personally check out the person who’s signing up, you vet that they have a real handle. And then when they start leaving reviews, you have the ability to find out, that’s cross-linked back to your approval, right? So, you know it’s a real person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4QQpX"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqv7WW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask because what’s really interesting is that you’re building a social platform to keep brand deals on social platforms in check. Have you thought about the range of social platform issues that we’re all really familiar with now? Like yep, people are going to lie to you. Has anybody lied to you and tried to get in yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFOdDS"&gt;Yeah. Tons of people. And we don’t let them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yL5eSr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me an example. Tell me a story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZHhgC"&gt;We have a lot of brands who try to get in by reviewing their own brand. And when they sign up it will be like so-and-so at brand.com and then the review will be for that same brand. And the review will be super nice and credit some social media manager. They’re like, “This person was so great...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULzRum"&gt;We don’t let them in because as soon as we start doing that, people don’t trust what’s on our website. You have to pick a side and we picked the side of creators. This is for them. We are exploring ways to work with other third parties who connect brands and creators. But we must remain independent in order for this to work in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ueol3q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anybody that you’ve let in just left fraudulent reviews? Specifically, the comparison I’m making is to a platform like Yelp, which just has a known set of problems that they’ve had to solve for years. Have you thought about how you will solve those problems or pick up their best practices? One of their problems is, maybe it’s not the restaurant or the brand leaving themselves a positive review but it’s some rival leaving a negative review, which is much harder to spot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2zUL9"&gt;Well, right now it’s a review site, but we really view this as a full-on information tool. We keep the community closed to control for these types of issues. But also, fundamentally we’re different than Yelp or Glassdoor because we’re not attracting people here with the promise of jobs. We’re not going to make money by allowing brands to control it or manage their reputation amongst the people they hire. That’s not our business. Our business is providing information to this future workforce that is integral to the entire consumer industry and that’s who we’re committed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fl9Mt6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that you’ll see rates rise over time? One of the things about pay transparency in general is when you’re more transparent about rates, you see the rates go up over time. People have a better negotiating position. Have you seen that happen in any small way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yQANp"&gt;Yeah, absolutely. We have tons of feedback. A lot of the time, people don’t even know to ask for money. They’re just excited, especially the smaller influencers with smaller audiences, they just want to know, “Hey, I can ask for $1,000 and it’s not a big deal.” So we had one user tell us that this has been a lifeline through the pandemic. He’s a single dad. He blogs about being a single dad, and this has totally changed everything. And it’s not just like, “Oh, a brand has reached out to me.” Some of the data we collect on these brand reviews we collect is, how was your experience? What were the deliverables? What are your aggregate stats? And then internally, everybody has a follower bracket, but it’s also any advice you have for anyone considering working with this brand. People really want to help each other. They want to help each other get jobs. They want to help each other make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hngDXX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems like the sort of dataset where it’s really useful to a curated set of users. But after a while, if you scale the way that you’re hoping to scale, brands are really going to want to peek into that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kBSDS"&gt;Yeah, I don’t care. I don’t care what they want. This isn’t for them, at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsFKdA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems like once you have attracted enough people and you scale the way you’re hoping to scale, eventually you’re going to have this huge set of data and insights. And there’s just going to be an enormous amount of interest from brands who want to see it or have access to it. It seems like one business could be charging brands a bunch of money for various insights or premium versions of this product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cLRRH"&gt;On their own brand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yGFUX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I don’t know, I keep on coming up with brands to talk to you about, and they’re always just the worst choices. So, if I ran Emirates Airlines, I just want to know what people are saying about me. They have a lot of money, they could just pay you and you could ship them off a PDF report of what people are saying about Emirates. Is that a thing that you would consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmUGSA"&gt;No. I wouldn’t join or be honest with a website as a creator, if I knew that this could potentially get back to the people I worked with because everybody talks. I think in aggregate, on a broader industry scale, that sort of thing is safe, but not at an individual level. To me, that’s scary. I’ve spent years building my reputation and personal brand within this community. That’s a big reason why people join. They trust that their data is in good hands. This is also a reason why we are exploring strategic partnerships with businesses who do work with brands and influencers in trying to come up with a safe way to help brands better their influencer marketing networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwWUBg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like if you’re not going to charge the brands, you might inevitably have to charge the creators.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lh7HmJ"&gt;Yeah. But this is about the future of work too. In two years, something like 60 percent of the US workforce will be freelancers or small businesses. They will need business tools to make better business decisions. And then beyond that, when you think about creators and the types of creators who are big now, what nearly all of them have in common: they were able to withstand long periods of time with spotty income or no income to build their brand and their audience. And the people who aren’t able to do that, really rely on brand deals through this middle time of growth to supplement their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0f7Nvg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you think about creators and the types of creators who are big now, what nearly all of them have in common: they were able to withstand long periods of time with spotty income...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gC3XLt"&gt;So that’s really who we’re for. And a lot of the things that go into that are things that just tie people to traditional employment, like health insurance, wealth management, tax services, all that stuff is fair game for monetization in the future. If we can help people leave their traditional jobs and make better decisions about how they should be spending their time as a creator, I think the opportunities are endless. And then also, if we capture a gathering place where the most influential people in the world within a niche are there, like it’s their gathering place, I think that is extremely valuable. We’re just waiting for our users to tell us what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LONXPB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you think about growing and scaling and getting to that size, we see with social networks across the board, at some point, the scale overwhelms their ability to moderate or control the community. Have you planned for, I’m going to have to start hiring moderators. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnIkx3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has to say things like, “We’re not the arbiters of truth.” And then everyone yells at him. Do you have a content moderation policy that everyone has to agree to? Have you thought about how you would enforce it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHOJpl"&gt;Yeah. I think I touched on this earlier. We really want to give members of our community that permission. We want the community to be able to moderate themselves. If someone is on our platform obviously acting a fool, they can report that person and figure it out. And then at some point, they will have permission to take stuff down. So we’re still pre-seed and still trying to gather all the data, but we do talk about that a lot, how to do that. But we want it to be different. It’s like, we’re not an advertising-based model. We don’t let everybody in. So thinking about moderating, what goes on within, is completely different. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky6cuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It does. I’m just curious, it’s the challenge for every community-based platform who eventually gets so big that there are some cranks along for the ride, and you have to have some policy to either minimize their importance or get rid of them entirely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV6zvn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t seem like you have a big enough community to need to worry about it yet. I’m just curious if you have a thought in mind for when you will have to start building that capability or hiring those kinds of moderation professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqbIJ4"&gt;Yeah. Again, this next year is about creating a product that’s sticky and can scale. And I think we’ll have the answer to your question in probably six to eight months. We’re super early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9StBYo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In many ways it’s kind of a great problem to have. You kind of want to have a problem where you have so many people you have to moderate them, but then it’s a very challenging problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YapIy"&gt;And this is why we kick so many people out right now. We’ve only let in 2,500 people as of today and we have over 4,000 on our wait list. It’s because we don’t know what to do with them, because they haven’t followed the rules. So maybe one day we can create some sort of safe, limited access that has all these features. But until we figure out exactly what you’re asking, that’s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhISXZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have been a creator. You have lived that life. It is challenging. We see a lot of kids who want to be YouTubers and Instagram and TikTok stars. I don’t think they know that they’re signing up to be one-person entrepreneurs, CEOs of a small business, right, with all the attendant— and every creator I talked to mentions this, but you’ve done that work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6E910"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are now a startup CEO, even hustling for money and investors. You’re trying to grow. You have to come on shows like this and answer annoying questions from me. Which one’s harder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5C3ujn"&gt;Which is harder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYevkM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it startup CEO or is it influencer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Q7gF"&gt;They’re both hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2mf26"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because this is what all the kids want to be. All the kids want to grow up to be CEOs. They all want to do startups or they all want to be YouTubers. And I’m always like, well, both is both. They’re the same thing. They require a lot of the same skills. But now that you’ve had both experiences or you’re in the middle of both experiences, which one do you think is more challenging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDSoFY"&gt;They’re both challenging.  I think I’m untraditional as a CEO because I am the full-time content marketing team right now, too. So they’re both challenging, and a lot of the challenges come from people always wanting to separate different parts of the organization. We have product, who does X. We have marketing, who does Y; we have this and this and strategic partnerships to do Z or whatever. But a lot of these overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="truEID"&gt;It’s kind of like the human brain. I don’t know if you do a lot of reading on how the mind works in psychology, but a lot of people try to compare the brain to organizations. I try to compare the organization to the brain, I guess, because there’s a lot of overlap. I don’t think I’m answering the question. They’re both hard. They’re both very hard. I cannot pick one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvnBhB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got a graduate degree in finance. You have been a model. Do you think this one is using all of that skillset and all that experience? Or do you think if you stuck it out and tried to be the full-time influencer, you could have brought those skills to bear over there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOBaQ"&gt;I think maybe the CEO role is more challenging because I have to keep doing the influencer job and I have to bring in more people and I have to consider more people other than myself in literally everything I do and the brand does. It’s not just my decision anymore. It’s my partner. It’s a group thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5T7CaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. What’s next for Fuck You Pay Me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZ0rkz"&gt;The next thing for us is hiring, building a product that can scale, collecting user feedback, and figuring out how exactly to monetize in a way that provides value to our users, and then we raise our series A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwdBxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There we go. All right, Lindsey, thank you so much for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. This was a great conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1oqGN"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI might help edit the next generation of blockbusters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dKGp8yuJimxGF0xbclNjYS_clA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887849/VRG_ILLO_2727_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;Artist: William Joel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PHA94"&gt;The next few Tuesdays, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; is showcasing a miniseries dedicated to the use of artificial intelligence in industries that are often overlooked, hosted by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Ashley Carman. This week, the series focuses on AI for the video world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="135X8Q"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP1621517193&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqtoZP"&gt;More specifically, we’re looking at how AI is being used as a tool to help people streamline the process of creating video content. Yes, this might mean software taking on a bigger role in the very human act of creativity, but what if instead of replacing us, machine learning tools could be used to assist our work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hf8Hzi"&gt;That’s what Scott Prevost, VP of Adobe Sensei — Adobe’s machine learning platform — envisions for Adobe’s AI products. “Sensei was founded on this firm belief that we have that AI is going to democratize and amplify human creativity, but not replace it,” Prevost says. “Ultimately, enabling the creator to do things that maybe they couldn’t do before. But also to automate and speed up some of the mundane and repetitive tasks that are parts of creativity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI3Whd"&gt;Adobe has already built Sensei’s initiatives into its current products. Last fall, the company released a feature called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21517616/adobe-photoshop-ai-neural-filters-beta-launch-machine-learning"&gt;Neural Filters for Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to remove artifacts from compressed images, change the lighting in a photo, or even alter a subject’s face, giving them a smile instead of a frown, for example, or adjusting their “facial age.” From the user’s perspective, all this is done by just moving a few sliders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pv3P_11A3Y6kpricjENiNS-vex8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21974085/neural_filters_age_change.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe’s Neural Filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HXLz6N"&gt;Adobe also has features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18293526/adobe-after-effects-content-aware-fill-remove-unwanted-objects-videos"&gt;Content Aware Fill&lt;/a&gt;, which is built into its video editing software After Effects and can seamlessly remove objects from videos — a task that would take hours or even days&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to do manually. Prevost shared a story about a small team of documentary filmmakers who ran into trouble with their footage when they realized there were unwanted specks on their visual caused by a dirty camera lens. With Content Aware Fill, the team was able to remove the unwanted blemishes from the video after identifying the object in only a single frame. Without software like Adobe’s, the team would have had to edit thousands of frames individually or reshoot the footage entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRNJ-DiNoq_ZK6_lEOmC5hdkRAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16005237/aftereffects.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe’s content-aware fill for video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R5HauJ"&gt;Another feature from Adobe called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864359/adobe-premiere-pro-auto-reframe-sensei-creative-cloud"&gt;Auto Reframe&lt;/a&gt; uses AI to reformat and reframe video for different aspect ratios, keeping the important objects in frame that may have been cut out using a regular static crop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhGxMB-bWMf0L1xFsb_5q1Ihx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19196988/premiere.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe’s Auto Reframe feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="chCzEr"&gt;Technology in this field is clearly advancing for consumers, but also for the big-budget professionals, too. While AI video editing techniques like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659432/deepfake-ai-fakes-tech-edit-video-by-typing-new-words"&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have not really made it onto the big screen just yet — most studios still rely on traditional CGI — the place where directors and Hollywood studios are&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the way to using AI is for dubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKAlCJ"&gt;A company called &lt;a href="https://www.flawlessai.com/product"&gt;Flawless&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in AI-driven VFX and film-making tools, is currently working on something they call TrueSync, which uses machine learning to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22430340/deepfake-dubs-dubbing-film-tv-flawless-startup"&gt;realistic, lip-synced visualizations&lt;/a&gt; on actors for multiple languages. Co-CEO and co-founder of Flawless Scott Mann told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this technique works significantly better than traditional CGI to reconstruct an actor’s mouth movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1uJcw"&gt;“You’re training a network to understand how one person speaks, so the mouth movements of an ooh and aah, different visemes and phonemes that make up our language are very person specific,” says Mann. “And that’s why it requires such detail in the process to really get something authentic that speaks like that person spoke like.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0RG81"&gt;An example Flawless shared that really stood out was a scene from the movie &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump, &lt;/em&gt;with a dub of Tom Hanks’ character speaking Japanese. The emotion of the character is still present and the end results are definitely more believable than a traditional overdub because the movement of the mouth is synchronized to the new dialogue. There are points where you almost forget that it’s another voice actor behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5XeTFY"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/544367823?h=d1aa5d7b71&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NmCetl"&gt;But as with any AI changing any industry, we also have to think about job replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0eUxz"&gt;If someone is creating, editing, and publishing projects by themselves, then Adobe’s AI tools should save them a lot of time. But in larger production houses where each role is delegated to a specific specialist — retouchers, colorists, editors, social media managers — those teams may end up downsizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q52hG"&gt;Adobe’s Prevost believes the technology will more likely shift jobs than completely destroy them. “We think some of the work that creatives used to do in production, they’re not going to do as much of that anymore,” he says. “They may become more like art directors. We think it actually allows the humans to focus more on the creative aspects of their work and to explore this broader creative space, where Sensei does some of the more mundane work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6A3DlG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will video teams end up downsizing?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5eliTv"&gt;Scott Mann at Flawless has a similar sentiment. Though the company’s technology may result in less of a need for script rewriters for translated movies, it may open up doors for new job opportunities, he argues. “I would say, truthfully, that role is kind of a director. What you’re doing is you’re trying to convey that performance. But I think with tech and really with this process, it’s going to be a case of taking that side of the industry and growing that side of the industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tKVMX"&gt;Will script supervisors end up becoming directors? Or photo retouchers end up becoming art directors? Maybe. But what we are seeing for certain today is that a lot of these tools are already combining workflows from various points of the creative process. Audio mixing, coloring, and graphics are all becoming one part of multipurpose software. So, if you’re working in the visual media space, instead of specializing in specific creative talents, your creative job may instead&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;require&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you to be more of a generalist in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlRpzO"&gt;“I think the boundaries between images, and videos, and audio, and 3D, and augmented reality are going to start to blur,” says Prevost. “It used to be that there are people who specialized in images, and people who specialized in video, and now you see people working across all of these mediums. And so we think that Sensei will have a big role in basically helping to connect these things together in meaningful ways.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of our favorite gaming laptops is $330 off at Dell today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell G5 15 SE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKjfMu8dPTqpzeaWDX-pJqaq3pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887715/cfaulkner_200714_4098_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Normally $1,230, Dell is offering the G5 15 SE right now for 27 percent off.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kbdl0T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Our review of the Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; cemented it as one of our favorite gaming laptops of last year. More than a year later, however, this laptop still packs plenty of power and its most powerful configuration is &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fproductdetail%2Fafwn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Dell for just $900&lt;/a&gt;. While Dell’s gaming laptops typically use Intel-based architecture, the G15 SE instead relies entirely on AMD hardware. A Ryzen 7 4800H CPU capable of delivering speeds up to 4.2 GHz and a 6GB RX 5600M GPU deliver excellent performance for 1080p gaming. While we weren’t thrilled with the aesthetics of this laptop, we couldn’t argue with the overall performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PvHMuh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops for 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="9yWRfR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505968"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9whHo3"&gt;A favorite among &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our review of the Xbox Elite Series 2&lt;/a&gt; should give you some idea about how much we love this controller. Right now, you can add this beast to your gaming arsenal for $158, its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lowest price ever at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This model brings back the backside paddles of its predecessor, as well as the swappable thumb sticks and a D-pad. Perhaps the controller’s biggest improvement, however, is its built-in rechargeable battery, which can last up to 40 hours on a single charge and can be recharged via the clamshell case, which doubles as a charging dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DJoSrB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2E0Riz"&gt;Looking to upgrade your aging gaming setup at home? If so, the curvaceous Razer Iskur gaming chair has received a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered-High-Density/dp/B08WVT8TYQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hefty discount on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, making it just $400 for a limited time. While it definitely raised some eyebrows last year with its snakeskin aesthetic, the Razer Iskur has proven itself to be one of the most comfortable gaming chairs in its class. The Iskur has a wide variety of adjustment options, as well as uniquely pronounced lumbar support that can be moved based on your height and posture. While its price point is certainly a bit on the high side, the Razer Iskur is a great investment for anyone who spends a considerable amount of time planted behind a desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="llmbZi"&gt;The cringe-inducing humor of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; can be yours today for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCIgvdH26e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The writing of the Borderlands series has always been divisive, but regardless of your stance on poop humor, the gameplay remains extremely addictive. A staple of the loot-shooter genre, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; marries a virtually limitless number of weapon combinations with RPG-style character builds and its own unique brand of comedy. While it definitely has more than enough features and content for an engaging single-player experience, the game also supports up to four players via online co-op. Right now, Best Buy is offering $20 off the physical version of the popular title on &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCIgvdH26e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; (PS4 and PS5 compatible) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752590262130868900" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; (Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X compatible).

    <title>Amazon’s new Kindle Paperwhite adds a bigger screen, longer battery life, and USB-C</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsTn0JaJHG46SoYvY9qEuw0GbXI=/144x0:2547x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887568/Kindle_Paperwhite__Lifestyle_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="olqfaL"&gt;Amazon is refreshing the Kindle Paperwhite for the first time in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;nearly three years&lt;/a&gt; with an updated model, adding a bigger 6.8-inch E-Ink display that’s brighter and has adjustable color temperature, USB-C charging, a faster processor, and weeks more in battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01lJ0F"&gt;The current Kindle Paperwhite has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245079/best-e-reader-amazon-kindle-kobo-ebooks"&gt;been Amazon’s best e-reader&lt;/a&gt; since it was released nearly three years ago, and Amazon isn’t messing with the formula too much. The new model’s design is similar to the old one, with a flush-mounted display, built-in backlight, 300 PPI resolution for crisp text, and IPX8 waterproofing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XWFMqa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finally, a USB-C Kindle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzJVX8"&gt;The new model, however, looks to improve on virtually every aspect of the e-reader. The battery has been boosted from six weeks to approximately 10 weeks from a single charge. Charging itself is faster: thanks to USB-C, the device can fully charge in about two and a half hours. There’s a new SoC, which (combined with software improvements) Amazon says offers a 20 percent improvement in performance. And the color-temperature changing tech that Amazon debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;2019 Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt; has made its way down to the more affordable Paperwhite for reading at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo7qCc"&gt;The most noticeable change, however, is the bigger display, which is jumping from six inches to a 6.8-inch panel. Amazon is still maintaining the same 300 PPI pixel density, so text will look just as crisp despite the larger display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A3BSA6SB6YuCKsbT_sVOctUjTvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865670/Kindle_Paperwhite_Signature_Edition.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TT86zW"&gt;In order to achieve that minimal increase in size, Amazon has shrunken down the bezels on the new Paperwhite. Given that the bezels are the primary place that you generally hold a Kindle, we’ll have to see the new device in person to gauge how that change works, although generally smaller bezels are a good thing in the tech world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql9JGt"&gt;The new Paperwhite models will also feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671844/amazon-kindle-e-reader-interface-design-changes"&gt;Amazon’s updated Kindle software&lt;/a&gt; that it announced earlier in September; at launch, they’ll offer the new smartphone-style swipe-down settings menu and a new menu bar at the bottom of the homescreen. An additional update is planned for later in the year that will more substantially update the homescreen and library menus with more scrollable interfaces. Additionally, Amazon is introducing a new log-on system with the new Paperwhites that will add the option to log in using a Kindle app on a smartphone instead of having to struggle with the Kindle’s on-device keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hXyRC"&gt;For the first time, Amazon is also introducing a pricier, upgraded version of the Paperwhite alongside the base model: the Paperwhite Signature Edition, which is identical to the standard version, with three differences. First, it adds Qi wireless charging to make it easier to recharge. Second, it offers 32GB of storage, compared to the 8GB on the standard model. And lastly, it offers the automatically adjusting light sensor that Amazon had previously only offered on the Oasis (whereas the base model has to manually adjust things). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lcqDqRlXRVK9uC_C-3iNWRlaCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865669/Kindle_Paperwhite__Covers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MxtZsq"&gt;While the new Paperwhite — and in particular, the Paperwhite Signature — have gotten the top-tier Oasis model’s most obvious standout features, the $250 model still has a few additional differences that leave it at the top of the pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfUWN"&gt;The Oasis still has the largest display of any Kindle (a seven-inch E-Ink panel, compared to the Paperwhite’s 6.8-inch display), and it features 25 LEDs for a brighter overall display. The Oasis also has its unique form factor, with an aluminum body, rotating display, and physical page turn buttons that Amazon’s cheaper models still lack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imH4sX"&gt;That said, hopefully Amazon will borrow a few features from the refreshed Paperwhites, like USB-C charging and the Paperwhite Signature’s wireless Qi charging, for its next Oasis refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTqKtg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The updates come with a $10 price increase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zh21BI"&gt;The new improvements do come with a cost, though: the new Paperwhite starts at $139 (a $10 increase from the 2018 model), and the Paperwhite Signature Edition &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $189&lt;/a&gt;. Those prices are for the ad-supported models; getting a Paperwhite without ads will add $20 to the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgaH9g"&gt;Amazon is also selling a Kindlewhite Kids Edition with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model for $159&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Paperwhite, a kid-friendly cover, a year of Amazon Kids Plus, and a two-year extended replacement program, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;existing bundle Amazon has for the base Kindle model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTkC0c"&gt;Orders for the new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Paperwhite models start today&lt;/a&gt;, with the new e-readers expected to ship starting October 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wls9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMGPL1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cJyzO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit Charge 5 review: touchscreen fatigue</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The hardware is nice, but no physical button is a big step back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bEvTFr"&gt;Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 5, might be the biggest change to the Charge line yet. It has a color screen, the first for a Charge, and you can opt to keep the screen on all the time. It has a new rounded design that’s thinner than the Charge 4. New sensors measure how your body responds to stress. But all that change also comes at a higher $179.95 price, a $30 increase from the Charge 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skm5ru"&gt;That more expensive cost edges the Charge line closer to the prices of many smartwatches. So in reviewing the Charge 5, I wanted to figure out if it offers enough at that price to make it a compelling fitness device than the more costly smartwatch competitors. To do that, after I got the Charge 5, I picked up an Apple Watch SE to compare it with, set them both up, put one on each wrist, and promptly went on a four-hour marathon training run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLAuzH"&gt;To my disappointment, the Charge 5 didn’t fare well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nzajz8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhyVIj"&gt;Before I go further, I should tell you what I need a fitness tracker or smartwatch for. I’ll be the first to admit that it’s a somewhat specific set of requirements and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gTUFy"&gt;My favorite form of exercise is running. I happily submit myself to multi-hour runs many weekends of the year. I don’t really care about running fast; instead, I like to run far. So when I’m on a run, I want a fitness tracker to tell me how far I’ve run, how long I’ve been running for, what time it is, and my heart rate. The Charge 5 did tell me all of these things. However, it did so much less elegantly than the Apple Watch did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaCo1s"&gt;Many of my frustrations come down to the Charge 5’s small 14.7mm x 21.9mm screen, which is surrounded by much bigger bezels than the official product shots would suggest, and its UI, which isn’t as easily glanceable as I would have liked. During a run, the Charge 5 shows three metrics at a time, and two of them are always visible in small font at the top and bottom of your screen: your mileage and how long you’ve been running. Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s66bDH"&gt;But in the middle of the screen, you can only see one of &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; other metrics at a time, such as pace, heart rate, and step count. To get to the next metric, you have to tap the screen to advance them one by one. Infuriatingly, I couldn’t figure out a way to go &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to a metric if I accidentally tapped past the one I was looking for, often meaning I would be tapping the screen repeatedly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCpAEv"&gt;The Charge 5’s small screen is also poorly optimized for showing long run times. During my training run, I liked having the length of my run shown as the main metric in the middle of the screen. But after I crossed two hours, I noticed that the Charge 5’s screen cut off part of the time on both ends. It looks ridiculous — see for yourself below — though Fitbit tells me that this will be fixed for final retail units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sR4-svR_5kBBuhR96UhWAIw12ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864043/jpeters_210910_4757_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit says that the time being cut off will be fixed in final retail units. Also, sorry to subject you to my sweaty arm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOyNnh"&gt;Also annoying is the fact that the Charge 5 has no physical buttons, meaning you have to wake up the screen by raising your wrist or by tapping on the screen. Many times during my four-hour run, I would tap on the Charge 5’s screen a couple times to wake it, only to accidentally tap past the last metric I had up, forcing me to &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; tapping just to return to where I was before. This was very annoying, and I often had to completely stop running so I could tap the screen enough times to get my Charge 5 situated again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr6rOa"&gt;The Apple Watch, on the other hand (pun intended), showed me all of the stats I care about on one screen, no extra tapping required. And because I can use the digital crown &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the button on the side to wake it up, I never felt any risk of tapping something I shouldn’t that would mess up my run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoCjHF"&gt;Interestingly, the Charge 5 and Apple Watch SE recorded some different metrics when I took them out on runs. The Charge 5’s metrics portrayed me as a better runner; across two runs, the Charge 5 recorded slightly longer distances and slightly faster paces than the Apple Watch SE did. But it’s hard to know which is truly accurate. According to MapMyRun, which lets you plot runs on Google Maps, one of my routes was 6.28 miles, but the Charge 5 recorded it as 6.1 miles and the SE tracked it as 6.02.  Both devices, however, tracked the exact same average heart rate across both runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RYPian"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10759531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KTVY9n"&gt;(Unfortunately, I don’t have comparative data for my four-hour run because at one point I accidentally paused run-tracking on the Charge 5 for 20 minutes. This was my fault, not the Fitbit’s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63cbEm"&gt;Runs are my happy place — especially really long ones. I like to run in a forest while listening to podcasts or music. I haven’t relied on a fitness tracker in years, instead using a cheap Casio watch to track my time. But after a week of running with both the Fitbit Charge 5 and the Apple Watch SE, if I had to pick just one for future long runs, I’d grab the Apple Watch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kyXIVy"&gt;
&lt;p id="wLwefn"&gt;When I’m not running, I want my fitness tracker to be as inert as possible. I typically turn off as many notifications and buzzers as I can. I try to keep a relatively simple face. The Charge 5 works fine for this, though I have some annoyances with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVpRwQ"&gt;I love that the Charge 5 is smaller and lighter than the Apple Watch; it’s much more comfortable to wear and I regularly forget that it’s on my wrist. But I think the change to remove any sort of physical button-like mechanism is a step back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJCEyw"&gt;The Charge 3 and 4 created the illusion of a button with a small capacitive ridge that had haptic feedback when you pressed it. When using the Charge 4, if I ever got buried in menus, I’d just mash the “button” a bunch of times until I got back to the main homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pCaCTd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763402"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jX2vcU"&gt;But without buttons on the Charge 5, diving into menus almost feels like you can get lost. There’s no clear way to return to the main watchface, which was frustrating at first. I eventually learned that you can double tap the screen to return to the homescreen (which, to Fitbit’s credit, is something the app tells you when you set up the Charge 5, but I missed it). Doing that double tap is nerve-wracking, though. Every time I was about to do the double tap, I’d hold my breath, tap twice quickly on the screen, and hope that I didn’t accidentally tap something I didn’t want to just to return home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnSqnD"&gt;I also wished there was a button I could use as a reliable way to turn on the screen. Sometimes, I’d rotate my wrist up or double tap the Charge 5 to wake it up, but it just wouldn’t turn on. That would force me to rotate my wrist a few times or tap the screen in frustration to try to turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBB7kS"&gt;The always-on display isn’t the best fix because it has some annoyances, too. Like other always-on displays, when activated, you can’t actually interact with anything on the Charge 5 until you lift your wrist or tap on the screen. When you do that, the screen briefly flickers off and on again before you can use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbHidk"&gt;Fitbit also estimates a dramatic reduction in battery life when you use the always-on display — from seven days to two — meaning you will have to charge the device a lot more if you use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1St8u"&gt;That said, in my testing, the battery has been excellent. In the nearly two weeks I’ve been testing the Charge 5, I’ve only plugged it in three times&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; toggling on the always-on display for a few hours here and there throughout. (Though to be fair, when I went on the four-hour training run, I had accidentally turned off the heart rate monitor, which might have saved some battery.) If you don’t have the screen on all the time, you should get multiple days on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xW8fBpxLnx8aBIQklwqzcmI4ALY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859125/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Deep_Sea_Sport.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSdSi1"&gt;If you do want to use your Charge 5 like a smartwatch, there are some limitations. While the Charge 5 can notify you about calls, texts, meeting alerts, and updates from certain apps, you can only send quick replies to text messages and messages from some apps if you’re on Android. As an iPhone user, this provided a half-baked experience whenever a text message came in; while it was easy to look at texts, actually responding to them forced me to pull out my phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHIXac"&gt;There’s no native way to sync your Fitbit data to Apple Health or Google Fit, so your stats won’t show up on those platforms. There aren’t any third-party apps for the Charge 5. And there’s no built-in voice assistant, like you might find on an Apple Watch or a Wear OS smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0C2gDJgcgpeBoRbjtuI8WrxZTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864049/jpeters_210914_4757_0008.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Charge 4 (left) next to the Charge 5 (right). There’s nothing actually wrong with the Charge 4’s screen, it just photographed this way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oCmzx1"&gt;Fitbit is advertising a few new health features for the Charge 5, including the new electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to measure how your body responds to stress. (Fitbit introduced this feature with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;.) Once you’ve started the reading, you put two fingers on the sides of the Charge 5 and hold them there for two to seven minutes (you can customize the length). After, you’re asked to record your mood, and then the Fitbit will tell you more detail about your scan. Fitbit can also give you a Stress Management Score, but you’ll only be able to access a detailed report about it if you’re a Fitbit Premium subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvdrdT"&gt;Two other features aren’t ready yet, though, so I couldn’t test them. One is the “Daily Readiness Score,” a Fitbit Premium-exclusive feature that recommends how hard you should work out based on factors like your recent activity and quality of sleep. Fitbit says that feature is “coming soon,” and it’s not a Charge 5-exclusive feature; it will also be available on the Fitbit Sense, Versa 3, Versa 2, Luxe, and Inspire 2. An ECG app is on the way, too, but that also has a vague “coming soon” release window. When I asked, the company wouldn’t give a more specific timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD0w6u"&gt;The Charge 5 is available to preorder now, though Fitbit wouldn’t share a more specific timeline for shipping beyond “late September.” (Amazon’s listing &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Included/dp/B09BXDZ9BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the Charge 5&lt;/a&gt; says it will be released on September 27th, however.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWOJlA"&gt;Overall, it’s hard for me to recommend the Charge 5. It’s a capable fitness tracker, and it offers a lot of features found on more expensive smartwatches at a lower price. But the small display, lack of a physical button, and sometimes poor UI mean it can be a hassle to use. For me, any annoyances are magnified when I have to deal with them in the middle of a run. Until Fitbit fixes those, you might want to consider something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smooth operators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lVLDlO"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are phones designed for people who care about the details. The improvements over last year’s iPhones are significant but not obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYOJiC"&gt;Just as with the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the most important upgrades on the 13 Pro are to battery life and the camera system. The 13 Pro adds a third major improvement with a high refresh rate screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZy42V"&gt;Upgrading the battery, camera, and screen sounds like an iterative, yearly update; they sound like the so-called “S” updates that Apple used to do for iPhones before its naming schemes became unpredictable. And it is true that the design is virtually identical to that of last year’s iPhone 12 Pros. But those assumptions — those words — don’t quite do justice to how big the changes really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SieXlO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDtzdX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will update this review with a full score and scorecard for the iPhone 13 Pro Max after further battery testing, but see below for initial impressions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gMdpOS"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6BiRNN"&gt;The change that’s most likely to make the biggest impact for the most people is battery life. Apple is happy to tell you that the battery improvements come from a constellation of updates, including increased efficiency in the new A15 Bionic processor and changes to how the new display uses power. I am sure all that is true, but I’m just as sure that the biggest contributor is simply that the batteries are bigger than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDhFmY"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;13 Pro has an 11 percent larger battery and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is an astonishing 18.5 percent larger&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s quoted improvements over the 12 Pro models are one and a half hours more usage on the 13 Pro and two and a half hours on the 13 Pro Max — and the 12 Pro Max was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a battery life monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Scpobu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The battery life improvement isn’t complicated; it’s a bigger battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ln2RL"&gt;I’ve only had the phones for a little less than a week, so I focused most of my use on the smaller iPhone 13 Pro as a kind of worst-case test. And my results are in line with Apple’s claims. On a day when we really pushed the phone with lots of 4K video and max brightness on the screen, it still lasted from early morning to 11PM with 20 percent remaining — with somewhere north of four hours of very heavy use in the screen time tracking app. A day with less intense usage clocked me at seven hours of screen on time before the low battery warning kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2OPp4"&gt;Although I haven’t used the 13 Pro Max as much, I expect it will do even better. A few times the past week I caught myself doing a double take, wondering why its battery was so full even though I’d been using it intensively. I will check back in to this review with an update after I’ve had a chance to do more testing with it (and with its opposite, the regular iPhone 13 MIni).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WII3Gv"&gt;Bottom line: I have much more confidence walking out of the house for a long day without carrying an external battery pack. For me, the line a smartphone needs to cross is that I trust I can get through a normal day without battery anxiety. Both the 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max easily get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLp7mtnBqNSAknvlWtvU99sTY0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863286/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQlOiN"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="occrhj"&gt;Last year was a big design update for the iPhone, with flat sides, 5G, and MagSafe charging. This year’s models inherit all of that, changing the design in only minor ways. The most obvious one is the notch on the screen. It’s slightly smaller, but only horizontally — it still pushes down into what you’re looking at to the same degree. Apple also didn’t do anything with that extra space at the top, meaning you still can’t see your battery percentage without pulling down the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK7xVY"&gt;The other design change is that the new iPhones are almost imperceptibly heavier and also thicker across the entire body compared to last year’s models. But the camera bumps on both phones are significantly bigger, which means that 12 Pro cases are not going to fit on the 13 Pro. I think the tradeoffs are worth it for the improved battery life and camera system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="pcyWDI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is virtually identical to the iPhone 12 Pro models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2z2yR_DeXfOX9MEg6-o6IBv9j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863283/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFKfj"&gt;Unlike many Android phones with gently curving displays at the edges, Apple does still have a small bezel around the screen. The rails on the edges are glossy stainless steel that pick up fingerprints, the glass on the back is a smooth matte. The front uses Apple’s Ceramic Shield finish to prevent cracks and the camera lenses are sapphire. It’s a beautiful phone, and I think it’s a huge step up from the curved sides we’ve seen on iPhones from the 6 all the way up through the 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpGUZC"&gt;The important spec outside of the camera system and the screen is the new A15 Bionic processor, which is indeed fast. But as always with iPhones, the primary purpose of that speed is ensuring the phone will still feel fast in years to come, not making it seem faster than last year’s device. There are a bunch of camera features that seem to be enabled by the A15, however. I’ll also just point out that the 13 Pro models get five GPU cores to the regular 13’s four, but that extra core doesn’t seem to enable anything specific beyond more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l76YW8"&gt;Base storage still starts at 128GB, but at the top end there’s a new 1TB option. That is a ridiculous amount of storage for a phone, but if you’re planning on shooting a bunch of ProRes video then it might be something to actually consider. Screen sizes and resolutions are the same: 6.1 inches at 1170 x 2532 pixels for the 13 Pro and 6.7 inches at 1284 x 2778 pixels for the 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hoSEK"&gt;In terms of networking, Apple is focused on expanding support for Mid-Band 5G — the kind that will actually matter more than the UWB version that’s only really available on certain street corners. All that really means is that in the US, the 13 Pro is ready for a 5G future that could come if carriers keep their promises (they haven’t so far, but maybe next year). As usual, if you travel a lot you should keep an eye on the bands available on the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/watch-out-with-iphone-13-there-are-now-5-different-iphone-models-by-country"&gt;several variants that are sold in different regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPPFI"&gt;Finally, although I know it’s a lost cause and that I sound like a broken record, I still believe that Apple should switch the iPhone from the Lightning connector to USB-C. I also still believe Apple made a mistake by not taking advantage of the obvious opportunities to do so with the big iPhone X and iPhone 12 redesigns. I understand the reasons why it hasn’t switched and I disagree with them. Especially on a “Pro” phone, the standard cable would be incredibly convenient and useful for both charging and connecting other accessories without adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8HH3XY"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XjydBk"&gt;The camera systems on the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max are identical this year, which means you don’t have to buy the bigger and more expensive phone to get the best photos.  And I do mean best photos, because there isn’t another phone on the market that can match the iPhone 13 Pro. (Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 hasn’t been released as of writing this, of course, but it will have its work cut out for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQNuIQ"&gt;Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look at this photo” as many times as I have during this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6FaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best cameras on a smartphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwoSXP"&gt;I will start, however, by pointing out that this camera system is one of the things I’m referring to when I say that the 13 Pro is a phone for people who pay attention to the details. In bright sunlight or normal light, the pictures these phones take are very hard to distinguish from the iPhone 13 or even the iPhone 12. In good lighting, almost any high-end smartphone is very competent these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tB58i"&gt;Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then “pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since 2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an f/1.5 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9snyn"&gt;All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography, the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNiF1qTIUPjGNK0aDdI0Hg4KaOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864637/pro_IMG_387230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qELZZp--7dGKjSn1RqYv3uJ8lTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864636/pro_IMG_384027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHDLat"&gt;There’s less image noise in low light and more dynamic range in low and even medium light. Apple also tells me it has adjusted how it handles the black point so shadow exposure is more accurate now too — the 13 Pro is just more willing to let darks be dark while accurately exposing lighter areas. In situations the 12 Pro would aggressively hop into night mode and lighten everything up, the 13 Pro often doesn’t need night mode. And when the 13 Pro does drop into night mode, it goes through that exposure process twice as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qEtF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763684"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JEN10O"&gt;We used this word last year in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max review&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it applies even more this year. The camera on the 13 Pro is &lt;em&gt;confident.&lt;/em&gt; As computational photography has become the norm over the past few years, I have seen lots of camera systems — including on the iPhone — just sort of panic and do the wrong things with exposure or tone. The iPhone 13 Pro has almost never done that in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsHBzJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Is8rtY"&gt;Let’s bring things back to earth. Will most people notice the quality difference between the 13 Pro and the regular iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhones? Most of the time, I think the answer is actually no. On phone screens, you really have to zoom in and pixel peep to see it. But if there’s any place where I think it makes sense to call an iPhone “Pro” as in “for professionals,” I think this main wide angle camera is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrLtfy"&gt;The ultrawide camera also got an upgrade in terms of taking in more light, but it’s not as dramatic a difference. A more interesting upgrade is adding autofocus to that camera, which allows it to pick up a new trick: macro photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idnl0a8E2FeczI16Oy53UzoyQbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JECJG9xniss22pVNWNxDdoZ_xlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864676/pro_IMG_388931.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6Bqd7"&gt;When you bring the phone in close to a subject, you can see the camera frame switch over to the ultrawide when it’s about 10cm away. It tries to keep the same basic framing with a crop, but apparently not everybody is enthused: Apple emailed us the night before the review to say it would ship a software update later with an option to disable the automatic switchover. Then you can keep pushing in until you’re as close as 2cm away and still have an in-focus shot. The photos it takes are better than the bespoke, throwaway macro lenses on many Android phones these days. It’s a fun feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6s3uz"&gt;The wide angle camera has gotten the most impressive upgrade, but my favorite is the new telephoto lens. Apple has set it to a 3X zoom, the equivalent of a 77mm focal length and up from the 2.5X / 65mm in the 12 Pro Max. That extended zoom does mean that it drops to an f/2.8 aperture (from f/2.2), but whatever low light losses that entails are more than made up for by the addition of night mode for this lens. Apple isn’t playing the superzoom 100X game; instead, it’s focusing on quality at the 3X optical zoom for things like portrait photography. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylna0kEm-Pig_PHBswqpjhrljDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864680/pro_IMG_016205.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz8xA"&gt;And that quality is incredible. I simply love taking photos of people with the telephoto at 3X now, getting a natural bokeh effect without having to engage the software portrait mode. The telephoto lens gets the award this year for most improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3fn2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10763698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwkE4"&gt;Apple has held the crown for best smartphone video for a very long time now, challenged (but not losing) only briefly by the Samsung Galaxy Ultra series phones in the last year or two. This year, video quality is simply amazing, at least on the wide angle camera. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization instead of just OIS makes for stable and beautiful footage even in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxNQn"&gt;Apple will also let you shoot video in ProRes this year. I didn’t have much time to test that and ProRes isn’t really a part of our video workflow. But it’s there if you buy an iPhone that has enough storage to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFmse8"&gt;I’ll state it plainly because it bears repeating: the iPhone 13 Pro has the best camera system on any smartphone available as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2QfiFHTQ51U-p_4X3AdX1z2Fhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864295/IMG_0281_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNMM6c"&gt;Photographic Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TUVWr1"&gt;Apple has added two new camera modes to this year’s iPhones, both Pro and regular. Each is fascinating in its own way. Cinematic Mode is essentially Portrait Mode but for video, while Picture Profiles change the default way the iPhone takes photos. Picture Profiles are particularly interesting because they serve almost as an admission that Apple is feeling competitive pressure from the likes of Samsung and Google, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5cJno"&gt;Profiles are a new setting in the camera app that change the way your photos look by default. So instead of applying a filter after the photo is taken, you can set your iPhone to have a specific kind of “look” right away. In fact, Apple insists that Profiles are not filters at all, for reasons I’ll get into shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1v5ctq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dad4CO"&gt;The default options for Profiles include Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. Each one has its own little sliders that you can manually tweak for both Tone and Warmth. If you tweak those sliders, the name of that profile cleverly changes to match your settings (my personal favorite name is “Rich Cool,” because I imagine that’s Apple’s target demographic). When you set one of these profiles, it becomes the new default way the camera takes pictures, though it will also pop up a button that lets you toggle it off. (The button is also clever, the way it looks changes based on what profile you’ve set). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlWvlf"&gt;The TL;DR for Profiles is that “Rich Contrast” makes the iPhone’s photos look more like a Google Pixel, with bluer tones and deeper contrast. And “Vibrant” makes the iPhone look more like a Samsung phone, with more extreme colors all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WbYvA"&gt;Historically, Apple has insisted that what it aims for in photography is the “truth” of what your eye would see. I will (regretfully) set aside philosophical questions about the nature of objective reality and what a photograph is and instead just point out that it’s fair to say that when it comes to photography, Apple is much less opinionated than the competition. Samsung and Google are both more willing to tune their images to be more pleasing to their customers than Apple is. With Profiles, Apple is essentially giving its customers the option to get pictures they like better without having to edit them after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles on iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="usyFdq"&gt;Understanding how Profiles actually works is a little complicated. Apple’s computational photography process is called Smart HDR, and what it does is standard across many phones these days: it takes a bunch of photos at different exposures all at once and then combines them into a single, final image. Part of that process involves making choices about white balance, color, contrast, and so on. Another part of that process is the iPhone semantically recognizing different things in the scene — things like faces, people, grass, sky, cats, or whatever and exposing them differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qspoht"&gt;When you set a profile, the iPhone makes different choices during the Smart HDR capture about white balance, color, contrast, and so on based on the preference you set. It also uses that semantic recognition to make better choices for things like skin tone. That’s why it’s not a filter — it’s not applied evenly across the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3iOb"&gt;Profiles are not something you can undo in the edit — though Apple does label them in the metadata when you view them in the Photos app. You should also know that you can’t shoot with profiles and have RAW output on at the same time. Unlike a RAW photo where you can make all sorts of choices in the edit, Photographic Profiles lock your choices in to the file as it’s saved. In theory it might be possible for the iPhone to save all of that extra data, but Apple tells us that it would create huge files that it wouldn’t be worth it for ordinary use, and that people who do want to edit after the fact can just shoot RAW.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIe2Z"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HkyZIA"&gt;Apple’s flashiest iPhone ads are for Cinematic Mode. It’s an entirely new mode for iPhone video that uses software to blur the background of a video, much as Portrait Mode does for photos. Unlike Portrait Mode, Cinematic doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for creating a depth map — it just uses software to recognize human faces and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BFX5"&gt;The reason Cinematic mode makes for such a great demo is that it can automatically shift the focus when something happens in the scene. It locks on to the biggest face that it sees, but if that face turns away the iPhone can automatically shift focus to somebody else in the background. It is fun to play around with and works with both the rear and front-facing Selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Es4aQ"&gt;You can also change the focus point as you’re shooting by tapping something in the background and lock focus by tapping again. And then after you’re done shooting, you can change your focus decisions moment-to-moment in the Photos app and even change the amount of background blur for the entire video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ANjnyRUm4phHT-0w1eXsBHm6Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864316/cinematic.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tY3mZT"&gt;Because it’s the equivalent of Portrait Mode for video, it can have the same problems as Portrait Mode for photos — it rarely works in low light, for example. (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/apple/status/1438955425265696775?s=21"&gt;own ads for Cinematic Mode show it working in low light&lt;/a&gt;, which I find misleading.) It can also have weird or bad cutouts around hair, which is a little less noticeable because it’s video, but it’s still there. Finally, Cinematic Mode &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works in 1080p at 30FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nPrp"&gt;Cinematic Mode really only works well within Apple’s own ecosystem of apps. The depth map information is saved into an ancillary “sidecar” file that goes alongside the video, but only Apple apps like Photos or Final Cut can do anything with it right now. If you AirDrop it to a Mac that isn’t running MacOS Monterey, the iPhone will bake all your depth choices into the file before sending it along. Apple tells us that it hasn’t worked with third party companies like Adobe or Lumafusion to make that data editable in those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPU6ht"&gt;I think Cinematic Mode is crazy fun but I’m not sure how much value it really adds to people who want to use their iPhone for actual, professional video work. I’m not going to say it’s a gimmick, but it is gimmick-adjacent. Like Portrait Mode in photos was at the beginning, Cinematic Mode feels like it’s a few years away from being truly useful for anything beyond casual use. Despite Apple’s promos, I have a hard time believing real movies will be made with this in its present state.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5NYQWg"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T0cjec"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max finally offer iPhone users a screen feature that flagship Android phones have had for quite a long time: higher refresh rates. Apple’s branding for its screen is “Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,” and the important part is the ProMotion, which previously has only been on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwRPY"&gt;Historically, the iPhone has been able to refresh its screen at 60Hz (or 60 times every second), but the new iPhone 13 Pros can vary the refresh rates from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz. Apple is using a type of OLED display called LTPO (&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) panel, technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;first seen on Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. It has a wide dynamic range, can get much brighter, and also uses less power because it can ratchet down the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcoWDq"&gt;What all this means practically is that scrolling and animations look much smoother. It also has battery life benefits because if nothing’s moving on the screen, the screen needs to refresh less often and therefore uses less power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Ni8VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple waited too long to introduce high refresh rate displays on its Pro phones, but it has implemented them well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T22XNY"&gt;None of this is news to Android users, but if you haven’t used a high refresh rate display on a phone before it can be a little hard to explain why it makes a difference. This is doubly true on iPhones, because Apple has gotten away with not putting a high refresh rate screen on an iPhone for so long because iOS is itself a very smooth OS without very much jank in its animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7on6Wr"&gt;When I scroll on the iPhone 13 Pro, the text stays readable instead of turning into a blur. Things moving on the screen are smoother. It feels more like a direct interaction with my finger because the iPhone can literally change its refresh rate to match my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv2at6"&gt;Apple’s implementation is also smart: iOS keeps an eye on what activity is happening on the screen and adjusts the refresh rate to match. So the screen matches the 24FPS frame rate in video apps, for example. Apple tells me apps coded with its default tools like Swift will get these benefits for free and that developers will have access to tools to update their apps to support ProMotion if they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ved8rg"&gt;I get if all this sounds very silly. It is very much a premium feature that is more about experience than anything practical. That’s exactly what ProMotion is and it is exactly what I think we should expect from a phone that costs more than a thousand dollars. It was a similar story when Apple’s own high-density Retina Displays hit the scene. Once many people experienced the nicer thing, they were bothered by its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59ronC"&gt;I have heard all the speculation about why Apple waited this long to implement this feature and I don’t really buy any of them. I admit that high refresh rates are the epitome of “nice to have,” but part of the point of Apple’s extravagant Pro phones is to provide the nicest experience. Now, finally, they do. Crucially, Apple did an excellent job with its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLs5Lq"&gt;The ProMotion display is the perfect example of what you get with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. It’s an improvement that may only matter explicitly to a few but will subtly make life nicer for everybody who uses it. The battery life upgrade isn’t quite so subtle, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4679X"&gt;As for the camera, I can see it both ways. When you’re sharing photos and videos to social media and looking at them on a phone, the differences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; subtle at most — but they’re there if you look for them. And if you use your iPhone’s camera for more than just Instagram, you’ll appreciate the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf4R3E"&gt;The list of significant things I have to complain about with these phones is almost astonishingly short. (Though, as you might expect, I can quibble for days about little things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;lack of a meaningful MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, the lightning port, or how iOS 15 handles notifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ven5Ti"&gt;The story of the iPhone 13 Pro is a story of iteration, sure, but iteration &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. iPhone 12 Pro owners will have to pay a lot of attention to see some of the differences and an upgrade probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you’re using something older, all that iteration comes on top of the major improvements from the iPhone 12 Pro — the upgrades will be very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk2gK9"&gt;Either way, when you start to pay attention to the details, prepare to be impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
