    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9Fdq2cbCOno63VPkrLW_l1q9i4=/0x114:3722x2595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062458/51637033819_8899737def_o.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4ra4r"&gt;SpaceX is launching another crew to space this evening, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-monthlong stay in orbit. Traveling inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, the crew will get an early start on their mission, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03PM ET on November 10th out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5T1RE"&gt;The mission is called Crew-3, and it will carry NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. This will be the first trip to space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari — the mission’s commander. For Marshburn, this will be his third flight to space, and for each of his missions, he’s flown on a different vehicle. His first flight was on the Space Shuttle and his second flight was on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. Now he’ll get to experience the Crew Dragon, which the astronauts have nicknamed “Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erkIUc"&gt;Crew-3 is SpaceX’s third operational crewed flight for NASA as part of the space agency’s Commercial Crew Program — an initiative to use private vehicles to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As part of its initial contract with NASA, SpaceX is slated to perform up to six crewed flights for the agency, with two flights tentatively scheduled for next year. However, NASA recently indicated it is already thinking of how to transport astronauts beyond those initial missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rkf4Sp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUrHY9"&gt;While this is SpaceX’s third operational mission, it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit on its Crew Dragon spacecraft. In order to prove the Crew Dragon’s safety for NASA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. That first successful test flight paved the way for SpaceX to start doing routine flights with Crew Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmXRG8"&gt;And in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX launched a crewed flight called Inspiration4&lt;/a&gt; that carried four non-NASA astronauts to orbit. Touted as an all-civilian crew, the passengers included a tech billionaire — who paid for the trip — a childhood cancer survivor, a professor, and an engineer. The foursome, who stayed in orbit for just three days, used the launch as a way to raise charity for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. It was SpaceX’s first truly private human spaceflight mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7AaTft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-3 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to take off on Wednesday November 10th, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida at 9:03PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d79QSH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 9:03PM / San Francisco: 6:03PM / London: 2:03AM / Berlin: 3:03AM / Moscow: 5:03AM / New Delhi: 7:33AM / Beijing: 10:03AM / Tokyo: 11:03AM / Melbourne: 1:03PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Coverage will begin at 4:45PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pih5I7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NUMBER ONE PROBLEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="POENO3"&gt;Though Inspiration4 wasn’t a NASA mission, SpaceX learned a few things from that flight that will help with the upcoming Crew-3 trip. The Crew Dragon that flew the Inspiration4 flight operated pretty smoothly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681339/spacex-inspiration4-crew-return-earth-splashdown"&gt;except for one key element&lt;/a&gt; inside the spacecraft: the toilet. SpaceX revealed that a tube in the toilet that transports urine into a storage tank came unglued. This caused urine to spray into the toilet’s fan system instead and pool under the floor. It wasn’t really a problem during the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaRu5"&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back,” William Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of flight. “We got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor, and we saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DeEBBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFcVb6"&gt;After seeing this, SpaceX worried that the same problem might be happening on the Crew Dragon used for Crew-2, which was docked with the International Space Station until Monday. Sure enough, the astronauts on the space station went inside that Crew Dragon and found similar urine contamination under the floor of the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hFNFEZz19ju3KBbqe8cZrij2VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966250/51137531971_c3db77a39c_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the toilet inside the Crew Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsOEbW"&gt;The main concern with this pooling is that it’s not just urine collecting under the floor; SpaceX adds a compound to the urine called Oxone, which removes the ammonia from the liquid to help get rid of odor and prevent bacteria from growing. But SpaceX became worried that the mixture of Oxone and urine in the floor could actually corrode the spacecraft itself. The company did tests that involved combining the urine and Oxone mixture with aluminum — the primary metal used to make Crew Dragon — inside a chamber that simulated the same temperature and humidity on board the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5I071"&gt;The toilet issue was more of a problem on Inspiration4, since the crew spent their entire mission inside Crew Dragon, using the bathroom for multiple days, leading to more potential corrosion. Most of SpaceX’s other Crew Dragon missions send people straight to the International Space Station, so astronauts are typically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only using the toilet before docking. Also, SpaceX claims that the aluminum alloy it uses on Crew Dragon is “very insensitive” to corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMn9zN"&gt;SpaceX opted to fix the toilet issue anyway by making the toilet an “all-welded structure” so that there are no longer any parts or tubes that can come unglued. That way no unwanted liquids will cause any trouble again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IgarsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING TO THE PAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3WYsrg"&gt;Crew-3 is set to take off from SpaceX’s launch site LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The crew will then spend a little less than a full day in orbit before rendezvousing with the International Space Station. Crew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously with the ISS, but the astronauts can jump in during the process if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5u8doCKF4fPM69k5Iljy1QZ4VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966270/51634067771_6e46bf9d92_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon, at the company’s LC-39A launch site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5A2d4n"&gt;Once Crew-3 arrives, they will join three crew members already on board the ISS: NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Originally, the incoming crew was supposed to be greeted by a much larger welcoming committee. Four additional astronauts, part of SpaceX’s Crew-2 mission that launched to the space station in April, were meant to be on board when Crew-3 arrived to help pass the baton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPj9sH"&gt;However, the Crew-3 launch has dealt with a number of delays. Originally scheduled for October 31st, the launch was pushed a few days due to bad weather forecasts. Then one of the crew members on Crew-3 developed a minor medical issue, prompting another delay. When that happened, NASA opted to bring the Crew-2 crew home first, worried that waiting any longer would mean landing the astronauts in choppy winter weather off the Gulf Coast. The Crew-2 astronauts safely splashed down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida in their own Crew Dragon on Monday night at 10:33PM ET, in what NASA called a “flawless” undocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfi6es"&gt;The splashdown of Crew-2, however, didn’t appear to be flawless at first. Just before hitting the water, only three of the capsule’s four parachutes — critical for slowing down the vehicle — appeared to inflate normally. The fourth eventually did inflate, but took about 75 seconds longer than the others. SpaceX claims it removed that parachute right after landing and brought it back to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for closer inspection with NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGNZol"&gt;“It performed essentially the way it was designed to perform,” Gerstenmaier said during another press conference last night. “We can land with three parachutes if we have to. This is potentially a known condition that can occur with the four parachutes — one of the four parachutes can be a little slow to deploy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTMhaj"&gt;Ultimately, NASA cleared the way for SpaceX to launch last night, but there is still one last item on the agency’s to-do list. Six hours before takeoff, NASA plans to fire up the International Space Station’s thrusters to move it out of the way of a piece of space debris — a precaution to make sure the vehicle doesn’t suffer any damage. The debris is a leftover fragment from 2007, when China destroyed one of its own satellites in space to prove that it could take out spacecraft in orbit. The test created thousands of pieces of debris, which still seem to be causing a nuisance in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7LQvY"&gt;However, the avoidance maneuver should not have an impact on today’s launch, which NASA says SpaceX can accommodate. After that, it’ll be time for the Crew-3 astronauts to fly, starting a six-month stay on board the ISS. They’re scheduled to return to Earth sometime in the spring of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dhIWB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 11:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been updated multiple times to indicate the various launch delays. New information was added about the Crew-2 landing and space debris avoidance maneuver. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbXSoB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4yJQvkwWefcAyltTUEaEUkUjOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957778/akrales_211020_4802_0710.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them everywhere, annoyed all of my friends by stopping to take photos every other minute, and was ultimately left with a vast range of situations and lighting conditions to compare the photos from these two cameras. Initially, I thought a winner would become obvious around the 200-photo mark, but I quickly realized using these devices was about far more than their end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ydCHj"&gt;Tune in to my video above, from my camera series &lt;em&gt;Full Frame&lt;/em&gt;, to see what phone ultimately took the gold. Or visit the &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ"&gt;Google Pixel 6 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; 100 best photos gallery to decide a winner for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUcHeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjmCcc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMTonE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htnkFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAILoq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft partners with Meta to integrate Teams into its Facebook-like Workplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCDbpBQZ9kgX5cct9rY2GbTfNB4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121819/Stylized_App.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workplace integration into Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G7BzNm"&gt;Microsoft is partnering with Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, to integrate Microsoft Teams into Zuckerberg’s Workplace platform. Facebook Workplace, or Workplace by Meta as it’s now been rebranded, will soon integrate Microsoft Teams to livestream video into Workplace groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKpIny"&gt;The Microsoft Teams integration into Workplace will also allow employees using Teams or Workplace to view, comment, and react to meetings in real time without having to switch between apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7XnDUE0o7Hb8moXWuXJbF11biU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001970/Meeting_Live_Broadcast.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams and Workplace by Meta integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GhM3EJ"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Workplace into Teams, which will enable Teams users to access Workplace content through an app within Teams. The app will be pinned to the Teams navigation bar and will include a homepage of Workplace content. Microsoft Teams admins will also be able to mark content as important to showcase it in the Workplace app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl0Qqp"&gt;“One thing I’ve learned ... there’s not going to be a one and only communications tool on the planet,” says Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration. “People are going to choose a number of tools, so I think it’s on us as responsible vendors to make sure they can integrate and interoperate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDWdss"&gt;This Workplace by Meta and Microsoft Teams integration is the latest in a broader partnership between the two companies. Workplace can already integrate into SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft’s Office 365 suite. Meta has also integrated Workplace into Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory, and it quickly became one of the top 10 apps for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWocndjtWxZCrFJxV2_UyFctHGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001973/Stylized_Live_Broadcast.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams will soon livestream into Workplace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TioQO8"&gt;Microsoft Teams is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684447/facebook-releases-portal-go-plus-video-calling-devices"&gt;arriving on the Meta Portal&lt;/a&gt; (Facebook Portal) device in December, allowing people to use video calling in Teams. This latest Teams and Workplace integration goes live today, with businesses able to share Workplace content to Teams. The livestreaming of Teams meetings into Workplace will be available in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4upkAn"&gt;Microsoft and Meta are also setting the stage to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758974/microsoft-teams-metaverse-mesh-3d-avatars-meetings-features"&gt;compete for the enterprise metaverse&lt;/a&gt; in the years ahead. Both companies unveiled similar visions for virtual spaces and meetings recently, but given these continued partnerships, we may well see the pair collaborate even further on virtual reality and metaverse efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things. The Yeedi K650 is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHMlRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QlaZd2"&gt;If you need more convincing before you buy,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, said this of the K650:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cAURyh"&gt;“For a really basic just-go-do-it, budget bot, the Yeedi is a real bargain and has a huge bin, so you don’t have to empty it as often — you can also &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/products/self-empty-station-yeedi-vac-series"&gt;get a self-empty station to go with it&lt;/a&gt; for another $200. It doesn’t have lidar or virtual boundaries (although there is a more expensive one that does), so you need to &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/collections/accessories/k650"&gt;use magnetic strips&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stop it from going somewhere, but it’s under $200 and it really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdyLY"&gt;And now for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o"&gt;something completely different&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that doesn’t have the M1 processor is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553831-REG%2Fapple_mxaw2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,300, this sale brings the storage-packed 512GB version down to $1,100. When it originally released, we thought its performance and display were top-notch (it’s still a fantastic device). Its display has True Tone tech that adjusts its color temperature based on your ambient lighting, and it features ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making your content run smoother than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The sticker price for this phone typically sits at around $600, but as long as you check the coupon box on the product page before you check out, you can save a grand total of $150. The 8T released about a year ago, and it’s an incremental upgrade over the OnePlus 8. But getting 256GB of storage and a 120Hz display at this price point is an excellent value, especially when you throw its Snapdragon 865 processor into the mix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCkP7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6IGU"&gt;With the impending release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711110/battlefield-2042-next-cross-gen-digital-standard-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 19th, it's the perfect time to gear up with this 500GB SSD from Western Digital. This PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD has been discounted to $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a complimentary code for the upcoming entry in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;franchise (a $60 value). This essentially makes the SSD just $30 and is a solid value for 500GB of fast storage. If you want to double the storage, the 1TB version of the drive is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B099FNMV34?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $140&lt;/a&gt;. While this SSD is a perfectly suitable option for anyone looking to expand the storage of their desktop or gaming laptop, you’ll need to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; to attach to it before you install it in your PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Noo40"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10753135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktnQBs"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 wireless headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. These headphones normally cost $400, but the black-colored set is down to $248, while the white model is just $241 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which color you like, this is a solid deal and pretty close to the lowest price we’ve seen for these headphones at any retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoTqn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with the addition of USB-C charging, as well as the incredibly comfortable design. While we admit that the original price was a bit high for what they offer, the Sennheiser Momentum headphones are a much better value at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fehyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPSayk"&gt;The delicious-looking Google Nest Mini is currently half price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/jWQnG5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00781us.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dorama,&lt;/a&gt; bringing the cost down to $25. This isn’t the lowest-ever price we’ve seen on this home assistant speaker, but nevertheless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; called it “a great sounding upgrade over the Home Mini.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KePwx7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tO18cA"&gt;A couple of other deals to check out...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gkTdGt"&gt;Save $100 on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ6MTC4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy RoboVac 12 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $140. Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this device, but it’s still a solid deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Yl4f8"&gt;Amazon is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four months of Kindle Unlimited for just $5&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $40 for a four-month subscription, this service grants you access to over 1 million books, thousands of audiobooks, and monthly issues of your favorite magazines. All of these features are accessible on any Kindle device or via the Kindle app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta lets you manually scan for sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlpL7ZBOcfluDDeusfpsZTsseOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121343/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTags were released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkeFzN"&gt;Among the features added to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/"&gt;iOS 15.2’s second beta&lt;/a&gt; is a new option in the Find My app that lets you manually scan your surroundings for AirTags and other Find My-enabled devices that someone might be using to track you. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is accessible via a new “Items That Can Track Me” option listed in the Find My app’s Items menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5TOm"&gt;Hit the link, and the app will report if there are any devices nearby that aren’t owned by you and which have Apple’s tracking technology enabled. The app can then give instructions on how to disable the device. Alternatively, there’s a “Help Return Lost Items” option for items that have ended up in your vicinity accidentally rather than maliciously, which replaces the previous “Identify Found Item” text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAfBVZs-g2ti8bb7fk-Yq0K34DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002055/apple_unknown_items_scan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is accessible from the “Items That Can Track Me” menu item.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45ZZxa"&gt;AirTags are designed to let you keep track of items like keys or a bike in case they’re lost or stolen. The new beta feature is Apple’s latest attempt to assuage critics &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review"&gt;who quickly pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny AirTags are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;pretty good at tracking people and identified some shortcomings in the safety features Apple included at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHA2fa"&gt;In June, Apple announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;initial series of measures&lt;/a&gt; to address these concerns. So rather than waiting until an AirTag had spent three whole days away from its owner before emitting a warning chime, AirTags now do so after just eight to 24 hours. Apple also announced that it is building an app for Android users to alert them to the presence of unwanted trackers and said that it would be launching later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjZ5xN"&gt;Other tweaks that have arrived with iOS 15.2’s second beta include the introduction of the Legacy Contact feature Apple announced at WWDC 2021, which lets loved ones access your account and personal information in the event of your death. The &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;Communication Safety feature for the Messages app is also returning&lt;/a&gt;, although it now won’t notify a parent when nudity is detected in an image. It’ll just blur the image and offer safety resources. There’s also a new Hide My Email option in the mail app, and the interface of the Apple TV app has been tweaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ERa1d"&gt;As with every iOS beta, however, there’s always that chance that any one of these features may be tweaked or removed entirely before its stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android users get another app-based Google TV remote option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdrK1V7r-Xk36MHFjHX3YkPhWKk=/0x38:3800x2571/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120999/image__6_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote interface featuring a large touchpad and shortcut buttons.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MamqWM"&gt;Google has updated its Google Home Android app to add a built-in remote for Android TV, Google TV, and other devices like the Nvidia Shield. The feature, which was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/09/google-home-android-tv-remote/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a helpful option if you misplace a physical remote control. To use it, head to the page in the Google Home app for the device you want to control, and then tap “Open remote” in the bottom left corner of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CarEux"&gt;Although the Google Home remote feature is only available on Android for now, its eventual &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/11/google-home-android-tv-remote-app/"&gt;launch on iOS&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to be the far more useful addition. That’s because Android users already have the option of using a similar software remote via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;the Google TV app&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9083864?hl=en"&gt;remote tile in quick settings&lt;/a&gt;. iOS users, meanwhile, don’t get access to these same convenient features. Unfortunately Google is yet to announce when the new Google Home remote feature will arrive on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WX8haG5mRolc_RAJ6n1CdA5nn_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001974/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote also features an onscreen keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LoXxY5"&gt;Navigation involves swiping across a large touchpad interface rather than tapping on a D-pad, and there are buttons below the touchpad to replicate a physical remote’s back, home, and Google Assistant shortcut buttons. There is also a button to turn a TV on and off and we saw volume and mute buttons appear when using the remote to control an Android TV-based projector. Similarly, a keyboard automatically appears when prompted to enter login credentials, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZw0cD"&gt;None of this will be revolutionary for Android users, but it bodes well for iOS users when the functionality eventually arrives in Google Home’s iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InVgTT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg2pDD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google loses key appeal against €2.4 billion EU shopping antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBBl1sSCAxqWuRqV_vywKq6FMi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120920/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OeFrkn"&gt;The EU’s second-most senior court, the General Court, has &lt;a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-11/cp210197en.pdf"&gt;upheld a 2017 ruling&lt;/a&gt; by the European Commission which found that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15872354/google-eu-fine-antitrust-shopping"&gt;broke antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; in how it used its search engine to promote its shopping comparison service and demote those of its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stxOLE"&gt;Google and its parent company Alphabet appealed the decision, but the General Court today dismissed that appeal and upheld a fine of €2.4 billion ($2.8 billion). Google and Alphabet now have the option to appeal the decision yet again with the EU’s highest court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9TzNy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is one of three antitrust cases pursued against Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfcpxt"&gt;This outcome is significant as it strengthens antitrust arguments made by the EU’s influential competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager against US tech firms. In addition to this shopping comparison case, Google has been hit by two other major antitrust cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising"&gt;AdSense&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and 2019 respectively. These cases are now going through a similar appeal process to the one Google lost today with Google Shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbbrTi"&gt;Key to Vestager’s legal argument in this and other antitrust cases is the concept of “self-preferencing” — the idea that a company like Google can break antitrust law by using a dominant position in one market (in Google’s case, search) to help it succeed in another (in this case, shopping). Self-preferencing is not itself a breach of EU antitrust law, but its potential harmful effects — like stifling better products made by rivals — are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YKHjY"&gt;In its judgement today, the EU’s General Court said it had seen enough evidence that Google’s behavior in this area was harmful. The company, said the court, had broken antitrust law “by favouring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favourable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx0ega"&gt;Because self-preferencing is common in the tech world — with companies often achieving scale by focusing on a single product before branching out to neighboring services — this judgement will strengthen other antitrust arguments made by the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oxoXuJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today’s judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEIjif"&gt;“Today’s judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google in other areas where it is throwing its weight around, like in online advertising, app stores and video streaming,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel for FairSearch, an industry association of Google competitors, in a press statement. “This victory is only the first step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoVRAq"&gt;However, despite celebration by Google’s rivals, the case also shows the extreme limitations in the EU’s ability to actually tackle antitrust cases in the tech world. The original complaint in this case was filed more than a decade ago in 2009, and today’s decision may not even be the final judgement if Google and Alphabet decide to appeal with the ECJ. In response to the 2017 judgement, Google did make changes to its business model, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-eu-google-antitrust-idUSKCN1C22B4"&gt;allowing rivals to bid to appear&lt;/a&gt; in its shopping search results, but rivals said this just created a new revenue stream for the company without addressing Google’s underlying advantage. Between the slow decision-making process and the perceived inadequacy of Google’s changes by its rivals, many will wonder if the EU’s antitrust work is really worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqgkYk"&gt;Meanwhile, antitrust advocates in the EU are already shifting their focus to the bloc’s next big legislative proposal to level the playing field with US tech firms: the &lt;a href="https://voxeu.org/article/european-commission-digital-markets-act-translation"&gt;Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, or DMA. This act was proposed by the European Commission in December 2020, and would force tech platforms to make new concessions to smaller rivals. However, even if the DMA is approved by the EU’s legislators, it wouldn’t be implemented until 2023 at the earliest. Speed is certainly not in the EU’s nature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto remaster gameplay footage leaks online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5SO_3Zpk2d5F3lrJxcROA1qJFL4=/0x0:2157x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120864/IkRyV0x71x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UI will look familiar to anyone who’s played the original games.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mTE0Q"&gt;Gameplay footage from Rockstar’s upcoming remaster of its PS2-era Grand Theft Auto trilogy has appeared online, after gameplay footage was apparently uploaded from early copies. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/over-an-hour-of-gta-trilogy-gameplay-footage-has-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC &lt;/em&gt;has collected together&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk706HvkZlU&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyWXkvH207s"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE5c6jZpvSA"&gt;uploads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTATrilogy/comments/qqnh2d/gameplay/?utm_term=1616885797&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;amp;utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_name=&amp;amp;utm_content=header"&gt;one Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;, which between them show over an hour of footage of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg0YjU"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;is just one day away from release, Rockstar hasn’t shared any substantial gameplay footage from the remastered games. A trailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;released last month&lt;/a&gt; focused almost exclusively on cutscenes from the three games rather than the gameplay enhancements Rockstar is promising for the almost two-decade-old trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkuRL2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5c6jZpvSA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sa5Y3h"&gt;But these leaked gameplay clips give a much better idea of how these remasters will actually play. They show off the games’ new weapon selection wheel UI, which they’ve inherited from later &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; games, and give an idea of how the &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;-inspired controls actually work in practice. One of the &lt;em&gt;Vice City &lt;/em&gt;clips appears to include footage of the player activating a cheat code and spawning in a tank (check it out from roughly the 16:10 mark below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4fZwjQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyWXkvH207s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fzrele"&gt;Other promised enhancements include overhauled graphics, better navigation via the games’ mini maps, and modern quality of life features like Achievements and Trophies on Xbox and PlayStation respectively. On Switch the game will feature motion-controlled aiming and touchscreen controls, and on PC the games will be compatible with Nvidia’s DLSS tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbNMMl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk706HvkZlU?rel=0&amp;amp;start=2" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TM5JLe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;will officially launch digitally tomorrow, November 11th, for $59.99 (£54.99) and will be available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and newer Series X/S consoles, and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher. A physical release is coming on December 7th, while iOS and Android versions are launching in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wsgKGv"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uuEdGj"&gt;After publication of our initial story, Rockstar released three official in-game screenshots of the remasters which also show off their user interfaces and the new weapon-select wheel. The company also confirmed that the games will include over 200 songs across 29 radio stations between the three games. Unfortunately there’s no sign of the over half a dozen songs &lt;a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/GTA-Vice-City-Back-Steam-Nearly-10-Songs-Removed-50206.html"&gt;removed from &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt; back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, which include Ozzy Osbourne’s “Bark at the Moon” and Kate Bush’s “Wow.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes hired a bunch of experts so she could ignore them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Qux9daylEIvyUmEu20DQYffEjQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119881/1235841861.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It seems like the doctors were just at Theranos for show&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uotItX"&gt;Here’s the thing about prostate-specific antigen: you do not expect to find it in blood test results for most women, because most women don’t have prostates. So when Theranos’ former lab director, Kingshuk Das, found that Theranos’ devices kept reporting that women had detectable PSA levels, he assumed that meant there was something wrong with the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ1wh0"&gt;Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes had an “alternative explanation,” he said. It was that these women had a rare kind of breast cancer. That explanation “seemed implausible,” he testified today in US v. Elizabeth Holmes. Das was one of a parade of experts we’ve heard from in this trial, who it seems were hired primarily to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLwQ9j"&gt;The central question of the trial, as framed by Holmes’ defense, was whether Holmes knew she was misleading people or whether she was simply a naif who somehow accidentally showed investors documents with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos on them, despite being written by Theranos staff&lt;/a&gt;. The question of state of mind is crucial: did she have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;the intent to deceive&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6LCeO"&gt;By the time Das had been brought aboard as lab director, several other lab directors had become uncomfortable with Theranos and quit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705156/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-aging-the-case-rosendorff"&gt;most notably Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;, who was a major source for John Carreyrou’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;2015 exposé about the company&lt;/a&gt; after being sidelined by Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59PQSe"&gt;In fact, testifying before Das this morning was Lynette Sawyer, a temporary co-lab director who never went to the physical lab and whose job seems to have been signing documents in Docusign. Her co-lab director, who was also a dermatologist for Holmes’ co-defendant Sunny Balwani, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/mynQhKwWy8Lmdmbz0X5G"&gt;had testified&lt;/a&gt; he didn’t know she was signing documents at the time. (Balwani is being tried separately.) Sawyer did not want to stay on after her six-month contract ended because she was “uncomfortable” with Thearnos’ lab procedures, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bO0nm0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both lab directors’ testimony suggested a clownshoes operation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8FAQU"&gt;During testimony this morning, Sawyer also told the court that she did not know what a Nanotainer was. (A Nanotainer was Theranos’ proprietary technology for storing fingerstick samples.) She also did not know that Theranos had modified third-party devices to run fingerstick samples. And Theranos apparently botched her paperwork; after she left, she had to send over a certificate necessary to show she could serve as a lab director, which Theranos would have to produce for an audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLCwYR"&gt;Both lab directors’ testimony suggested a clownshoes operation, but Sawyer didn’t have direct contact with Holmes. Das sure did, though. One strategy the defense has employed throughout the trial is to suggest that Holmes leaned heavily on Balwani, her co-defendant, and any possible fraud must have originated with him, not her. But Balwani left Theranos shortly after Das joined. He dealt only with Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O836ek"&gt;After Das joined the company, he received a stern letter from the lab’s regulator, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, saying the lab was deficient and enclosing a 121-page report on all the problems. Dealing with the lab’s deficiencies was “nearly the sole responsibility I had,” Das testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdiGm5"&gt;He reported to Holmes. He consulted with her frequently while trying to fix the lab. He even flew to Washington, DC with her to meet with CMS regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDCy6q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJY5q8"&gt;Throughout his testimony, Das painted a portrait of a woman who willfully refused to believe there was anything wrong with the Theranos devices themselves. Besides the weird thing about rare breast cancers, Holmes also didn’t agree with Das’ assessment that “these instruments were not performing from the very beginning.” Das came to this conclusion after extensively reviewing Edison data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwJiLl"&gt;But Holmes tried to blame quality-control problems, not the machines themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMIhkZ"&gt;To respond to CMS, Das voided years’ worth of patient results on the Theranos devices, sending results to patients and doctors that said the test result essentially wasn’t real. “I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use,” he said. After going through a great deal of documentation from CMS about the various Edison failures — which underscored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;earlier testimony from Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt; about Edison’s problems — the prosecution turned the witness over to the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4beS2d"&gt;Now, a great many people were hired to fix the Theranos lab conditions, Das testified when he was cross-examined. Those people were serious and diligent, and they worked hard, and he was the “quarterback,” in the terminology of Holmes’ lawyer Lance Wade, of that team. But if Holmes could not accept multiple lab directors telling her the Theranos machines didn’t work, I’m not sure it mattered how many experts were brought in to try to fix the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge orders Apple to allow external payment options for App Store by December 9th, denying stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfHbVkLMMQhHZhTITOgrGxiM88k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119772/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9RfBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers says Apple must comply with an order to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options, denying the company’s motion for a stay. “Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction,” her new order reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKykar"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order after a Tuesday hearing concerning the blockbuster antitrust lawsuit, which &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games filed in 2020 and which went to trial this year. During the hearing, Apple said it needed more time to rewrite its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering policies&lt;/a&gt; — rules that bar app developers from linking to payment methods besides the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trMA1x"&gt;“This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content. It’s going to take months to figure out the engineering, economic, business, and other issues,” said Apple attorney Mark Perry. “It is exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines to protect children, to protect developers, to protect consumers, to protect Apple. And they have to be written into guidelines that can be explained and enforced and applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwz4gq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq9mBW"&gt;Apple has mostly praised the ruling in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; — where Judge Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;concluded that Apple hadn’t violated antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; by kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store and said the company didn’t have to restate Epic’s developer account. But it appealed the section saying that Apple’s anti-steering policies hid relevant information from users and demanding that it remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztycTy"&gt;Perry noted that Apple already made one of the two required changes. In August, as part of a class action lawsuit settlement, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;removed a rule&lt;/a&gt; restricting how developers could contact users via email. But Apple has portrayed in-app links as a unique threat to user trust and safety, saying they could let developers scam users or send them to malicious sites. “We believe that these changes, if Apple is forced to implement them, will upset the platform. They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is a fact. It is going to happen,” said Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAZvlT"&gt;Epic framed Apple’s request as a delay tactic made without any real commitment to change. “Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it,” said Epic attorney Gary Bornstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4onQB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You haven’t asked for additional time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIx9yQ"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers was skeptical of Apple’s request particularly because it asked for an indefinite stay of the injunction despite saying Apple just wanted more time to evaluate risks. “You haven’t asked for additional time. You’ve asked for an injunction which would effectively take years,” she said. “You asked for an across-the-board stay which could take 3, 4, 5 years.” Perry responded that Apple wanted to delay the changes until the case was resolved — saying that it was confident “we’re going to win the appeal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhANpj"&gt;That didn’t sway the judge: in her order Tuesday evening, she accused Apple of wanting “an open-ended stay with no requirement that it make any effort to comply,” and suggested that “Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,” with regards to the company’s argument that it would be harmed by adding external links to alternate payment systems within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7KPck"&gt;Apple says it plans to appeal to the Ninth Circuit for a stay, since it didn’t get one from Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” writes an Apple spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMMHyJ"&gt;Pending a stay of some kind, the injunction is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;scheduled to take effect&lt;/a&gt; on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
