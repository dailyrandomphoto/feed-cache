    <title>Amazon’s earnings show why Andy Jassy is now in charge</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LuJ0Ze"&gt;As stores reopen and in-person shopping picks back up, the surge in demand for Amazon purchases has finally started to wane — not &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, to be clear, but just enough to frustrate investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T479j"&gt;From April through June, Amazon saw $113.1 billion in sales of products and services, growing 27 percent year over year. That’s an enormous amount of money, but investors were hoping for a bit more, around $115 billion, and Amazon’s stock has been slipping since releasing the figures in &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/default.aspx"&gt;its Q2 2021 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="szUb6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AWS is picking up speed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSFrk1"&gt;But there was one spot investors are happy to see, and it helps to explain the company’s recent executive shuffle. Amazon Web Services did $14.8 billion in net sales, up 37 percent year over year. That substantial growth outpaced Amazon as a whole and AWS’s prior Q2, when it grew by 29 percent. It was the sole business bright spot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy, Amazon’s new CEO&lt;/a&gt;, found worthy of mentioning in his remarks accompanying the release, saying “we’ve seen AWS growth reaccelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JJDZA"&gt;Jassy had been in charge of AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;up until July 5th&lt;/a&gt;, when he was elevated to CEO to replace Jeff Bezos, who left to go &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRje0TBHGPS/"&gt;eat Skittles in space&lt;/a&gt;. The cloud division has always been a powerhouse for Amazon, accounting for most of the company’s operating income. While its growth had slowed during the pandemic, the division now seems to be, as Jassy said, reaccelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny2Ktu"&gt;As for the rest of Amazon, the concern from investors over a company that merely made $113.1 billion in a three-month span may stem from two places. For one, last year Amazon was growing way faster — it saw 40 percent growth in net sales this time in 2020, versus 27 percent this year — though one might recall that a certain global pandemic was picking up during those months, encouraging a boom in online shopping. But secondly, the other tech giants have done quite well this quarter, beating investor expectations, making Amazon the odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N97EQW"&gt;Prime Day was also held in June this year, which likely helped juice those numbers. Amazon said 250 million items were purchased, more than any prior Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmx5Og"&gt;There have been signs that the growth of online shopping as a whole is starting to slow down. Growth is still growth, but it means that Amazon and its investors can’t expect to see gains quite as enormous as the ones that happened in 2020, as much of the world tried to avoid indoor shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UMkuU"&gt;Jassy hasn’t offered any indication of how he’ll steer the company differently from Bezos, but today’s numbers help to show why he’s in charge. AWS remains a bright spot, and its leader now has the rest of Amazon to look after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why wildfire smoke can be worse than other air pollutants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CLIMATE-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SN46av2PD0fa0Knno9dCdVs9QkQ=/0x0:5463x3642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652639/1234191295.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A haze of wildfire smoke and clouds is seen at sunset in an aerial image taken during a flight from Seattle to Los Angeles as Western wildfires, including the Bootleg, Dixie, and Tamarack fires, continue to burn in Oregon and California.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKh6RC"&gt;The explosive growth of wildfires in the Western US has spewed smoke across the landscape, creating a growing threat to public health. Driven by climate change, the 2020 fire season was so bad that it &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-04/california-fire-season-record-4-million-acres-burned"&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; the previous record in California for acres burned, and at-home monitoring of the smoke’s effects on air quality became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440343/air-quality-sensors-wildfire-smoke-pollution-climate-change"&gt;almost commonplace&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s season got off to a devastating start and has already darkened skies &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/map-watch-july-s-wildfire-smoke-travel-across-country-n1275343"&gt;on the East Coast with smoke from West Coast&lt;/a&gt; wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xavTsn"&gt;Smoke isn’t your ordinary air pollution. The tiny particles found in smoke can be up to 10 times more harmful to human health than soot from other things like tailpipes and factories, according to research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nubqpp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tiny particles found in smoke can be up to 10 times more harmful to human health&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7ujRH"&gt;The researchers looked at fine particles, also called PM2.5, that are 30 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair follicle. When a fuel burns, whether it’s gas or vegetation, it sends these fine particles up into the air and sometimes into our bodies. Fine particles from wildfire smoke led to 10 percent more respiratory hospitalizations than there would be without the smoke, the study found. Pollution from other sources, while still harmful, increased hospitalizations by just around 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCdPCf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Rosana Aguilera, the lead author of that study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego. She walked us through what she and other researchers are doing to better understand what wildfire smoke means for our health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBQSmQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti7AJQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are “fine particles,” and why are we worried about them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7n6Wo"&gt;The research group I work in studied the fine particles because it’s one of the main components of wildfire smoke. These particles are unique. Their chemical composition can vary in relation to the materials that are burning. There’s a myriad of potential compounds that can be present in wildfire smoke and fine particles like carbon, heavy metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOCzlv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wildfire smoke as a source of emissions is becoming more predominant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pApS0S"&gt;We are focusing now on these fine particles that are found in wildfire smoke because, in some regions in the US and in the world, wildfire smoke as a source of emissions is becoming more predominant. Here in California, it’s definitely one source of air pollution that seems like it’s going to be increasing in the near future. There are some publications that support the idea that wildfire smoke will be one of the main sources of fine particulate matter in regions like the Western US, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR1BTf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What effect can those fine particles have on human health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rls3Wl"&gt;It’s one of the air pollutants of concern because it’s small enough to penetrate our respiratory system and go deep into the lungs. It potentially also enters the bloodstream and from there, can travel to other organs. It can cause difficulty breathing. It can produce irritation and exacerbate conditions like asthma and other respiratory diseases and cardiopulmonary conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSjsXp"&gt;We deal mainly with acute effects, the response that we get after you’re exposed to wildfire smoke for some days. My research group is not specifically looking at long-term effects at this point, but I think it’s an area of research that needs to be expanded. It’s a bit more complicated to look at long-term exposure because you have to follow individuals who are exposed to multiple wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrLfUd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does wildfire smoke compare to air pollution from other sources like cars, trucks, and industry? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnqhHP"&gt;We found that wildfire smoke can be more harmful in terms of an increase of hospitalizations when compared to just looking at non-smoke fine particles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPrzUI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Traffic emissions might be very different in composition from wildfire smoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Faarp2"&gt;Traffic emissions might be very different in composition from wildfire smoke. We haven’t really looked at the chemical composition of these fine particles with respect to their sources. But some toxicological studies have looked into more detail into that, and they find that the toxicity of wildfire smoke might be increased. If it goes through a structure, then it might pick up some chemicals found in houses and other buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y0JwF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact do you hope your research will have? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCoPwx"&gt;We want to start looking more into these differential impacts of fine particles with respect to the sources of emissions and also try to look for some more of the chemical composition of different wildfires as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VM0B9f"&gt;If there’s a greater impact for wildfire smoke, and if wildfire smoke is going to be one of the main sources of this type of pollution in the future — or if it is already — we need to better understand why is it more harmful? And then what impact can we expect in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden wants states to pay people $100 to get vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Organization Assists Rural Mississippi Delta Residents With Rides To Nearest Vaccination Sites" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJt13pYXVRj1sE7LglpLH_B2GHM=/4x0:3997x2662/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652619/1231516435.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPdWH7"&gt;The Biden administration wants states and local governments to give $100 to “every newly vaccinated American,” the Treasury Department said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1420826432830386177"&gt;statement today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest federal effort to improve vaccination rates as COVID-19 continues to surge around the country, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmp4Go"&gt;States could use funding from the American Rescue Plan to fund the payments. The administration is not mandating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the incentive, but the Treasury Department said it was partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services to help governments roll it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6xnAk"&gt;New York City &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/nyregion/new-york-vaccine-mandate-one-hundred-dollars.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that it would give $100 to anyone who got a shot at one of the city-run vaccination sites. “I think when someone says here’s $100 for you, that’s going to make a big impact,” Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Wednesday. The program starts Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVYJHX"&gt;Financial incentives may help nudge some people to get their shot, Elisa Sobo, an anthropologist at San Diego State University who studies vaccine hesitancy, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/nyregion/new-york-vaccine-mandate-one-hundred-dollars.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Some people who have until now been on the fence will see $100 as a good reason to get off of it.” But it won’t be an incentive for everyone. “Some folks will find the offer insulting; others will use it as ‘proof’ that the vaccine is no good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4xoLC"&gt;Vaccination rates in the United States had been dropping steadily since April. They’ve started to slowly tick up again as people in states with major outbreaks — which had the lowest levels of vaccination — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/new-vaccinations-are-rebounding-in-the-u-s-s-covid-hotspots"&gt;sign up for shots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOeY0T"&gt;Biden is also expected &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/politics/vaccine-mandate-for-federal-employees-under-consideration/index.html"&gt;to announce a vaccine mandate&lt;/a&gt; for federal workers today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncontrolled firing from Russian module causes brief ‘tug of war’ on International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPNShGet72uBOudJ-JumUcRnq68=/107x0:1259x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652616/E7d_eh9VoAUNhlN.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Russia’s Nauka module | Roscosmos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MDxrZ"&gt;The International Space Station unexpectedly shifted in orbit on Thursday when thrusters on a newly docked Russian module began firing uncontrollably. The thrusters reoriented the football-field-sized laboratory’s position by as much as 45 degrees, NASA said. The station is back under control, a NASA spokesperson said, and its seven-person crew of astronauts, including three US astronauts, are safe, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfArLE"&gt;The erroneous thruster firings from Russia’s Nauka module, a new 23-ton multipurpose laboratory, began at 12:25PM ET, a few hours after it docked to the ISS. Thrusters on another side of the space station, from Russia’s Zvezda service module, fired up to counter the force from Nauka in what NASA’s mission control communicator described as a “tug of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adOtF4"&gt;“Just to update you guys,” mission control communicator Drew Morgan told US astronauts from Houston, “right now we’re in a little bit of a tug of war between thrusters firing from both the [service module] and [Nauka]. We are sorting through the best course of action right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsunOt"&gt;Roughly 10 minutes later, mission control in Houston and Moscow regained control of the station. “The [Nauka] thrusters are no longer firing, we are back in attitude control, rates are stable,” Morgan told the US astronauts. “It’s safe to say that the remainder of the day is no longer going to happen as scheduled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDezRn"&gt;NASA spokesperson Rob Navias said the crew was safe. The mishap forced NASA to postpone Boeing’s planned launch of its uncrewed Starliner capsule to the ISS, which was slated for Friday at 2:53PM ET. The mission’s next opportunity to launch would be Tuesday 1:20PM, but NASA and the Air Force are deliberating a possible time on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpx42I"&gt;Nauka, which means science in Russian, launched from Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last Wednesday after weeks of 11th-hour delays caused by issues with the module’s guidance system. Even though it launched last week, the module is unusually old — its development started in 1995, and it was originally slated to launch in 2007. But launch delays and several changes to its design and purpose pushed its deployment back by years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7dZXw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ria.ru/20210728/nauka-1743271183.html"&gt;Nauka ran into problems almost immediately upon entering space&lt;/a&gt;. The spacecraft deployed its solar arrays 13 minutes after launch without a hitch, but propulsion and communications issues prevented the spacecraft from entering its intended orbit. Engineers and mission control in Moscow scrambled to come up with a fix, eventually powering up the spacecraft’s secondary thrusters to prevent Nauka from falling out of orbit and burning up in Earth’s atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQItU8"&gt;Nauka regained its footing in a normal orbit and carried on with its eight-day trek to the space station, where it docked autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5PV4f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi5MRe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Annapurna showed off lots of cool games at its first showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvW0HqO9BRixyWUj6Xpg2FUd5vk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652368/AIShowcase_Stray_005.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo7MaI"&gt;Thanks to games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17007592/florence-iphone-ipad-review-monument-valley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16774194/gorogoa-game-review-iphone-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorogoa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421938/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review-ps4-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Annapurna Interactive has steadily become one of the most exciting indie game publishers around. And at its first showcase event, the publisher showed that there’s plenty more in the works. In less than 30 minutes, Annapurna revealed some exciting new partnerships and showed off upcoming games that involve everything from being a cat to hunting demons in heaven. Here’s everything that was shown off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="odCDZ2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R-splyERsI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CZGbwm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stray&lt;/em&gt; turns you into a cyberpunk cat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZWff5"&gt;Arguably the highlight of the event was the debut gameplay trailer for &lt;em&gt;Stray&lt;/em&gt;, a game set in some kind of forgotten cyberpunk city in which you play as a lost cat. It looks like a great action-adventure game, albeit one where you can nuzzle robots and scratch up a couch. It’s slated to launch on PlayStation and Steam in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmaLkf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDj13Mz2voM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wr3ue5"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Artful Escape&lt;/em&gt; gets a release date and star-studded cast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yDcHg7"&gt;Gorgeous musical adventure &lt;em&gt;The Artful Escape&lt;/em&gt; sends players on a “psychedelic, multidimensional journey” that involves lots of killer guitar riffs. It also has a killer cast: the game will feature voice work from the likes of Michael Johnston, Caroline Kinley, Lena Headey, Jason Schwartzman, Mark Strong, and Carl Weathers. It launches September 9th on Xbox and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hnp2PG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Storyteller&lt;/em&gt; lets you build your own narrative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8aVBLw"&gt;One of the brand-new announcements was &lt;em&gt;Storyteller&lt;/em&gt;, which is a bit of a puzzle game where the goal is to create a story. You’re given a theme, characters, locations, and other narrative elements, which you can then mix-and-match using what looks like a very intuitive drag-and-drop system. It’s listed as coming “soon” to both the Switch and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vkJDLo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pt9M6WumjtE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WPJ4bx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; is getting an expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AT18l8"&gt;The mysterious sci-fi adventure &lt;em&gt;The Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; is about to get even bigger: an expansion, called &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;, is due to launch on September 28th. The trailer is delightfully cryptic, so it looks like fans will have to wait to see what it really entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qmRjuP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hA7aG1C5FU0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="64Fjj1"&gt;A closer look at &lt;em&gt;Neon White&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrEDS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon White&lt;/em&gt; looks to be quite the departure for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/1/17806888/donut-county-game-la-los-angeles-ben-esposito-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donut County&lt;/em&gt; creator Ben Esposito&lt;/a&gt;. It’s described as a speedrunning first-person shooter “about exterminating demons in Heaven,” and the new gameplay trailer gives a better idea of what that really means. It’s expected to launch later this year on Switch and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xanBc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xC9uHfgzwU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TxnXPE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; is coming in October&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="piwa8p"&gt;The team behind &lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt; is returning with another gorgeous action game, and now we know when it’s coming out. &lt;em&gt;Solar Ash&lt;/em&gt; will be out on October 26th on PC and PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pTKM5j"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uwLG_-69EQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vBe3sb"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A Memoir Blue&lt;/em&gt; explores memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JZSPPu"&gt;Another new announcement, &lt;em&gt;A Memoir Blue&lt;/em&gt; is described as “a poignant story of a mother and daughter, experienced through memories cherished and memories suppressed.” It currently doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to a huge range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jm0Eo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CeyXnAn-7wY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2iouwS"&gt;A gameplay trailer for &lt;em&gt;Skin Deep&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt2O64"&gt;Blendo’s next release looks to make the world of immersive sims just a little bit weirder. The sci-fi game is about “sneaking, subverting, and sabotaging, all while not wearing shoes,” according to the developer. You can get a sense of what that means in the gameplay trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyday Shooter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="odgQoX"&gt;A number of new partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uIVTgg"&gt;In addition to new games, Annapurna also announced publishing deals with a quartet of exciting developers. That includes Jessica Mak, best known for the musical games &lt;em&gt;Sound Shapes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Everyday Shooter&lt;/em&gt;, as well as horror studio No Code and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306140/falcon-age-game-ps4-psvr-outerloop-vr-virtual-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer Outerloop Games. The publisher is also working with a new team called Ivy Road, led by &lt;em&gt;Stanley Parable&lt;/em&gt; creator Davey Wreden and Karla Zimonja, formerly of &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; developer Fullbright.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbriaHi1d5_5RwvF9qqMnr7hNN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19933496/11307R1ZIfdvILCMdVuXXAd33Cd1sdYWx79Vz_fNw7X4BTx0Ll9eARsm_PQg6Gr1uCW_rDhFODf_yIT0xyIGtz88RUor7U3z.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telling Lies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XU8Txz"&gt;Old games, new platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uL5hsY"&gt;Some of the publisher’s more popular games are also hitting new platforms in the near future. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20828666/telling-lies-review-steam-iphone-sam-barlow-interactive-thriller-her-story"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telling Lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gorogoa&lt;/em&gt; are coming to Xbox Game Pass, &lt;em&gt;The Pathless&lt;/em&gt; is coming to Steam on November 16th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506636/i-am-dead-review-pc-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is coming to Xbox and PlayStation on August 9th, and &lt;em&gt;Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt; will jump to mobile with an iOS port on August 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 now has its first beta release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHrEtgK_U7nYkMCwd_oG-nwHWQk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652247/windows11main.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUYU9i"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/07/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-100/"&gt;released the first beta of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, available to those enrolled in its Windows Insider Program. Until today, getting access to Windows 11 meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;installing the Dev preview&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flighting"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; is for “highly technical users” as it has “rough edges.” According to Microsoft, the beta release is less volatile, with builds being validated by Microsoft (though it’s still probably something you’ll want to install on a test machine or second partition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wmi8rk"&gt;Of course, to install the beta you’ll need a compatible computer. Figuring out if your hardware will work with the next version of Windows has been notoriously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;tricky to pin down&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft’s article about &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/"&gt;preparing for Insider builds&lt;/a&gt; directs people to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its system requirements page&lt;/a&gt;. The company has said that it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc"&gt;paying close attention&lt;/a&gt; to how well 7th Gen Intel and AMD Zen 1 CPUs work during the testing period, so it’s possible those systems could be allowed to run the beta but not the final release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_5ws3gSHrNMiuyR2OQFCYDOyNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748969/2021_07_29_11_48_14_Settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching to the Beta Channel is easy, for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DW3SC7"&gt;The beta release is also good news for those of us who installed the Dev preview to get our hands on Windows 11 as soon as possible, but don’t actually need to be on the bleeding (read: buggy) edge. If you, like me, are in this situation, you can switch to the Beta channel by going to Settings &amp;gt; Windows Update &amp;gt; Windows Insider Program, then clicking on Choose your Insider Settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlEvfv"&gt;Usually switching from Dev to Beta &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flighting"&gt;requires a complete OS re-install&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/windowsinsider/status/1420796240875380737"&gt;according to the Windows Insider Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be possible to do in place for a “short period of time.” It’s probably best to hop on that as soon as you can if you don’t need to stay on the Dev channel. I’ve tested it out myself, and switching to the Beta channel only required a quick reboot — a small price to pay for what will hopefully be smoother sailing until the actual release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0OAYYH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They are still betas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNDHAN"&gt;For those who are still running Windows 10, but are adventurous enough to join the beta, you can register for Microsoft’s beta program &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, while Microsoft says that the Beta Channel releases are more stable than Dev Channel ones, they are still betas. There will likely be bugs, crashes, and missing features — Microsoft even has a whole list of current issues &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/07/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-100/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which also says that the Teams Chat feature that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585360/windows-11-preview-chat-microsoft-teams-integration-insiders"&gt;available for some in the Dev channel&lt;/a&gt; isn’t currently available for beta users yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXfqvu"&gt;But if you’ve been itching to try out Windows 11, it’s now in a stable enough place that Microsoft is willing to call it ready for early adopters (for those who live on the verge, one could say).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GarageBand can now help you remix tracks from Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIVKZEteEhIaDqboikgwu4SwBNM=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652208/apple_garageband_update_jul21_hero_07292021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDUWki"&gt;If a year inside convinced you to shoot your shot at becoming an international DJ, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/garageband-features-new-sound-packs-from-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-and-top-producers/"&gt;Apple is updating GarageBand for iOS and iPadOS on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with a low-stakes way to start dabbling in the world of remixes. GarageBand’s Remix Sessions lets you try your hand at remixing tracks from Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga with short video tutorials available to watch while you mess with loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Yslx"&gt;You can access the new Remix Sessions from the Sound Library section of GarageBand. There’s currently only one song for each artist, “Break My Heart” for Dua Lipa and “Free Woman” for Lady Gaga, but the amount of samples and loops each song comes with is surprisingly broad. If you’ve played with GarageBand’s Live Loops before, the experience should be self-explanatory. Apple’s implementation of its video tutorial is a bit clunky — the downloaded artist’s Live Loops project will show up in your GarageBand, but to watch while you edit your song, you have to start the video in the Sound Library page and pop it into picture-in-picture mode manually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyeX-lAvjsQQLIegK_7GcCrLucQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748868/apple_garageband_update_jul21_remix_lady_gaga_07292021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can watch video tutorials with tips from Lady Gaga or Dua Lipa while you remix their songs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1sBBm"&gt;Apple is also releasing “hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples” in downloadable Producer Packs that, like the Remix Sessions, include video content that Apple says offers insight into the producers’ creative process. If a companion Mark Ronson Live Loops project that ties in to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/06/apple-tv-unveils-trailer-for-new-docuseries-watch-the-sound-with-mark-ronson/"&gt;an upcoming Apple TV Plus show&lt;/a&gt; is of interest to you, that’s available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNt3S"&gt;Interestingly, these new GarageBand perks are currently only available on iOS and iPadOS: users of the original macOS desktop version will have to go without Lady Gaga’s encouragement. The macOS version of GarageBand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490656/apple-garageband-new-update-1000-new-loops-artist-lessons-free"&gt;does include “Artist Lessons” for free&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph24954?locale=en_US"&gt;more hands-on educational videos&lt;/a&gt; for specific instruments like guitar or piano, so there’s at least something for you there if you’re trying to start your music journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zYqGD"&gt;GarageBand’s Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available to download now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over Black Widow’s streaming release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrPKSWUyr_2FYR2EOOkLe2KCz7g=/290x0:1310x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651944/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RpTUm4"&gt;Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over the simultaneous streaming release of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted the same day in theaters and on Disney Plus through its Premier Access service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Si0VK"&gt;The suit was filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court and alleges that Johansson’s contract with Marvel Entertainment, which is owned by Disney, ensured a “wide theatrical release” of the film. The suit says it’s “well understood” that the agreement meant an exclusive release that would not include streaming. Johansson’s salary was in part based on the box office performance of the film, the suit says, meaning the streaming offer could meaningfully cut into her paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22KALl"&gt;“Disney knew that the cannibalization of [box office receipts] by Disney+ would save Marvel (and by extension, Disney) ‘very large’ amounts of money that it would otherwise owe Ms. Johansson,” the lawsuit states. “On information and belief, Disney intentionally induced Marvel’s breach of the Agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WozDos"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cannibalization of [box office receipts] by Disney+ would save Marvel (and by extension, Disney) ‘very large’ amounts of money”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ab1XjN"&gt;Johansson could lose $50 million because of the altered release plans, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release-11627579278?st=b43fty44c1jljjq&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Disney did not immediately return a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk1Uig"&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Disney had two primary motivations for the hybrid release. First, it argues, Disney wanted to boost subscriber numbers for its streaming service and inflate its stock value. Second, the suit states, “Disney wanted to substantially devalue Ms. Johansson’s agreement and thereby enrich itself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxvZy"&gt;The lawsuit’s argument — that Disney promised an exclusive theatrical release before reneging on that assurance — seems to hinge on what constitutes a “theatrical release.” The suit states that both Marvel and Johansson understood the contractual promise of a wide theatrical debut to mean the film “would initially be released exclusively in movie theatres, and that it would remain exclusively in movie theatres for a period of between approximately 90 and 120 days.” But it’s not stated whether those details are present in her contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzs4qx"&gt;“As Ms. Johansson, Disney, Marvel, and most everyone else in Hollywood knows, a ‘theatrical release’ is a release that is exclusive to movie theatres,” the suit states. “Disney was well aware of this promise, but nonetheless directed Marvel to violate its pledge and instead release the Picture on the Disney+ streaming service the very same day it was released in movie theatres.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yk5G3i"&gt;Disney does seem to have understood that changing the release strategy would impact Johansson. Marvel’s chief counsel, David Galluzzi, wrote to Johansson’s representatives in 2019, indicating there would be a discussion if the release plan shifted, according to the lawsuit. “We understand that should the plan change, we would need to discuss this with you and come to an understanding as the deal is based on a series of (very large) box office bonuses,” Galluzzi is quoted as writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mrpXCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A ‘theatrical release’ is a release that is exclusive to movie theatres”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6oXLJi"&gt;Over the course of the pandemic, several of Disney’s titles originally intended for exclusive theatrical releases instead debuted simultaneously in theaters and on Disney Plus through its Premier Access platform. Premier Access charges an additional fee of $30 to stream these films from home on Disney Plus at the same time they’re playing in theaters. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and the live-action remake of &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; are among a handful of films that have released this way as theaters buckled under pandemic lockdowns and COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aegpp9"&gt;It’s a significant development in the release structure that has emerged during the pandemic. Many major streamers have opted to release films this way, including HBO Max. The model has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; from major Hollywood directors like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiBTrI"&gt;The lawsuit filed this week alleges that following Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the picture would debut as a day-and-date title, Johansson and her team attempted to negotiate with Marvel about the film’s release. It alleges that Marvel “ignored this outreach,” and the film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;debuted on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; under the hybrid release model anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6wqOigeWXYwlkB318-eVG-AgLc=/0x102:2000x1435/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651710/Edge_family_2021_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorola Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite all support 5G and come with a 6.7-inch OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYOUQf"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229740/motorola-edge-plus-android-phone-display-features-camera-specs-hands-on"&gt;keeping its return to flagship devices running&lt;/a&gt; for the second year in a row with today’s global announcement of the Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite. The top-end 20 Pro includes a periscope-style telephoto lens for the first time in a Motorola device and includes a Snapdragon 870 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8G23N3"&gt;All three devices support sub-6GHz 5G, offer 108-megapixel rear-facing cameras, and include 6.7-inch OLED screens with fast refresh rates. They’re due to arrive in August in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. While Motorola doesn’t offer specifics, it says that it plans to bring a 5G Edge device to North America this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8gGM8Ni6wMaaQ40TnvV0kCJ6QE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748778/Motorola_edge_20_pro_Indigo_Vegan_Leather_combo_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Pro comes in a handsome indigo vegan leather option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xxwhnE"&gt;Priced at €699 (about $830), Edge 20 Pro comes with many features common to the premium midrange class, including a Gorilla Glass 5 front panel, a 144Hz screen refresh rate, and 12GB of RAM with its capable 800-series chipset. Its main rear camera uses a 108-megapixel 1/1.52-inch sensor and f/1.9 aperture, specs that line up with last year’s Edge Plus camera. There’s also a new 8-megapixel 5x telephoto periscope-style camera with optical image stabilization. A 16-megapixel ultrawide does double duty as a macro camera, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62mzj2"&gt;A couple of specs don’t quite measure up to the flagship class, though, which was something we noted about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;“great but not quite good enough” Edge Plus predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. For starters, Motorola is committing to only two OS upgrades for the device, which ships with Android 11 — a policy that lags behind much of the field. The 4,500mAh battery can be charged via fast 30W wired charging but there’s no support for wireless charging. And its IP52 rating means it’s protected against splashes of water, but isn’t guaranteed to survive full submersion like the IP68-rated Samsung Galaxy S21. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6vMmqTCTBBdwoes7UPsds_xjcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748783/Motorola_edge_20_Frosted_Onyx_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 offers a 3x telephoto lens rather than the 5x periscope zoom on the 20 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2tWAB"&gt;The €499 (about $590) Edge 20 gets the same 6.7-inch OLED with 144Hz refresh rate (though just Gorilla Glass 3 on the front), but includes a stepped-down Snapdragon 778 processor. Rather than the periscope zoom, it offers a stabilized 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera, but its main and ultrawide cameras match those on the 20 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkhdvJprhyVHhDEIFM43iXokRS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748786/Motorola_edge_20_lite_Cyber_Teal_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Lite packs a bigger 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JazrSK"&gt;The budget-friendliest Edge 20 Lite, priced at €349 (about $415), uses a MediaTek Dimensity 5G-B chipset, includes a 6.7-inch OLED with a slower-but-still-fast 90Hz refresh rate, skips the telephoto camera altogether, and includes a bigger 5,000mAh battery. It maintains the IP52 rating of the other two devices and still includes 30W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvb9ut"&gt;We liked last year’s Edge phones, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;the more attractively priced midrange Edge&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of that was thanks to some strong camera capabilities. It’s promising to see Motorola leaning into that strength with a new telephoto lens, though the highest tier device still appears to lack a couple of key specs to compete well in its class. Maybe the midrange will be Motorola’s sweet spot again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwESPa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 29th, 3:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A previous version of this article stated that Motorola has only guaranteed one Android OS upgrade for the Edge 20 devices; it has committed to two. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;
