    <title>Ford stops taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIRLIa"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;stopped taking reservations&lt;/a&gt; for the all-electric F-150 Lightning as it prepares to start making and shipping the new pickup truck in the first half of 2022. The company says it has collected 200,000 refundable $100 deposits for the Lightning since it debuted in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXPMPy"&gt;That means that anyone not already in line may have to wait a while to buy Ford’s first mass-market electric pickup truck off a dealer lot (or order one from the company’s website). Ford hasn’t said how many it plans to build in 2022, but &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that the automaker is looking to build as many as 80,000 in 2023. The company has publicly said it wants to build that many in 2024 after originally targeting just 40,000 annually and has been hiring new workers to handle the demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JKLJJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Lightning starts at $40,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IpjInH"&gt;The F-150 Lightning starts at $40,000 but can more than double depending on which version people buy. That base model is supposed to offer around 230 miles of range and has a more bare-bones interior, including a 12-inch landscape touchscreen display that runs Sync 4. Higher trims will come with the same 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen from the Mustang Mach-E, and there’s an extended range battery option that can push the range to around 300 miles. Towing capacity ranges between 7,700 and 10,000 pounds, depending on the configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XdV8EN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sC14Jv"&gt;Reservation holders will be able to spec out their Lightnings starting in January, just a few months before the first trucks are supposed to ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez4Q90"&gt;As long as they start shipping on time, Ford will join Rivian and GMC as the only automakers with an electric pickup truck on the market. (Rivian started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;shipping its R1T pickup in October&lt;/a&gt;, while GMC’s electric Hummer pickup is supposed to start reaching customers by the end of this year.) Tesla’s long-promised Cybertruck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;has been pushed to next year&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Elon Musk has said his company won’t start making them in large volumes until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Life360 makes millions selling location data, and it’s about to buy Tile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An iPhone is in the center showing the Life360 app with locations of family members on a map. Surrounding the iPhone are images of trackable items by Tile and people and pets for Life360." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BiVIxwXkL3N4CE163DbmY7grN0E=/91x0:3241x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251172/One_Map_To_Rule_Them_All.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360’s marketing image of acquiring Tile is also a reminder of how much data it owns now | Image: Life360&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7UuBs"&gt;Life360, the company that bills its product as a “family safety service,” has been selling location data on its 31 million customers — including kids — since 2016, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebad8L"&gt;Former employees from data broker companies told &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;that Life360 is “one of the largest sources of data” for what has become a $12 billion phone location tracking industry. In November, the company announced it’s reached a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797559/tile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; the popular item tracking company Tile for $205 million and said it plans to pursue a dual public listing in the US (it’s currently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LhNA7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5G3PH0"&gt;“Our philosophy has been first ... be open with our users with what we are doing,” Hulls said, “and give them control.” The Life360 app defaults to consenting to sell user data and would need users to opt out within the app settings to prevent sharing of their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AprTLJ"&gt;While announcing the acquisition, which will maintain Tile as an independent entity led by current CEO CJ Prober, Hulls described plans for the companies to connect Tile accounts to the Life360 app. During our conversation, he said that the APIs could allow customers to combine all family members (including pets, via another recent acquisition, Jiobit) and their stuff in one interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="lgeq5C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today begins a new chapter in Life360’s history.  I’m excited to announce Life360 is acquiring &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTileApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thetileapp&lt;/a&gt;. This marks an incredible moment in our vision of being the world’s leading platform for safety and location services. Welcome to the team Tile! &lt;a href="https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS"&gt;https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Hulls (@ChrisHulls) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHulls/status/1462938228512624640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Nlxa"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, Life360 generated almost $700,000 from selling location data in 2016. This would later become a more integral revenue stream for the company. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, CEO Chris Hulls confirmed it brought in about $16 million in 2020, even as the company reported an overall &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21109082-life360-2020-financial-records#document/p39/a2066528"&gt;loss of $16.3 million last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH5vaQ"&gt;A Tile representative responded to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about how the deal potentially affects data from its Bluetooth (and, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;ultra wideband&lt;/a&gt;) trackers: “Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that.” Hulls told T&lt;em&gt;he Markup&lt;/em&gt; there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0jQFq"&gt;Companies in the location data industry like Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, and Allstate’s Arity all pay for access to Life360’s customer tracking. A former Cuebiq employee quoted in the report “joked” that their former employer would not be able to operate its marketing campaign without Life360 data. A former X-Mode employee said Life360 had the “most valuable offerings due to the sheer volume and precision” compared to other sources of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioyE8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; asked Hulls about the claim that his company is the largest hub for the phone location tracking industry; he responded, “We have no means to confirm or deny the accuracy.” Hulls also told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that Life360 does not share information with government entities — but once the data is purchased, “We cannot comment on the practices of another company or what that company does with data it receives from other sources.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTpnHw"&gt;Hulls continued in the email response to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; saying Life360 prohibits tracing back information to individual customers in its contracts with data purchasers. Hulls says he is also not aware of any instance where a customer was re-identified, stating Life360 follows privacy practices that are “industry best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVVQCZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Data brokers] depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ZKMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/bennett-cyphers"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff technologist Bennett Cyphers&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed out that very few apps disclose what companies they’re actually sharing data with because they’re not legally required to do so. It’s not only that the apps aren’t telling users where their data is going, and the companies that pass the data on refuse to tell their customers how it was obtained. As he put it, “Especially the ones [data brokers] that deal in location data, they consider the apps that they collect data from to be trade secrets, and they won’t reveal that to anyone, in response to anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1zlvq"&gt;Based on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests on situations where the government has obtained location data from a broker, in every case the EFF has seen, the government has no idea where the data is coming from. “Secrecy is these companies bread and butter, they cannot exist out in the sunlight. They depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data,” says Cypher about the information brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Z1JxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google bans tracking tool that sold users’ location data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621685/google-ban-safegraph-android-user-data-location-tracking"},{"title":"Secret Service bought access to cellphone location data ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DpBIeM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life360’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.life360.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043228154-Full-Privacy-Policy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;full privacy policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; states:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AwRXzh"&gt;We may share your personal information, including your precise location data, driving sensor data, unique identifiers or AD IDs and other data with our partners, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/privacypolicy"&gt;Cuebiq&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/trusted-partners/%20"&gt;Partners&lt;/a&gt;, for their marketing and business purposes, including without limitation, to inform and improve tailored advertising, attribution, analytics or research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MEIMKD"&gt;When I spoke to Hulls, he said there’s a list of companies that can purchase data from Life360 and that directly identifiable info — such as names and emails — is stripped out. This data is then put on a server that allows permissible companies to further process it and then distribute it to other parties. “No one can just buy someones’ random data,” Hulls said. Life360 also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Funderstanding-how-life360-uses-and-protects-your-data%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22820381%2Ftile-life360-location-tracking-data-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keeps a blog&lt;/a&gt; on its site where it states about 90 percent of its customers are using the “free application experience” and explains how some services are kept free by subsidizing revenues from location and ad data sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXB3uK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlZc09"&gt;Hulls feels that Life360 providing precise location data equates to the workings of targeted ads and how the industry as a whole, down to media sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is doing this. An example he gave was the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; using “aggregated phone exhaust data.” Hulls is confident that the services Life360 provides in exchange for data are valuable and compared his company to Credit Karma. From his perspective, “They take what’s pretty personal information, they’ve established trust that’s okay, they take your social, your billing, whatever, they give you credit card offers ... we want to do the same with insurance in a very transparent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQalv"&gt;In response to the anonymization of location data, Cyphers pointed out that anonymization is a “meaningless buzzword” in terms of location privacy, where simply slapping a device ID on information isn’t enough to separate it from a real person. The phone that stays where you sleep at night, then follows you to your workplace in the morning, and spends weekends at the places you hang out, is unlikely to belong to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc9mnm"&gt;In comparison to services like Credit Karma or insurers that have launched tracking apps or devices, Cyphers pointed out that people join Credit Karma frequently with the “sole intent” of finding a credit card or loan. Signing up for a family safety app, they may not be aware of how much money is changing hands, how much data is being collected, and how those goals could be misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyBuIL"&gt;We asked Hulls if he thinks Life360 has competitors that have not been similarly scrutinized: “I’m not here to call anyone out but am highlighting that the positioning of us as some giant shadow player is simply wrong,” he wrote in an email response. Hulls also says he believes customers are not worried, and that “if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate, but we haven’t had users complain about it in any meaningful sense.” In a follow-up email asking if users have reported they were unaware of how their data is used and shared, he says, “Less than .1 percent of our inbound customer support emails mention data whatsoever, and most of the ones that come in ask technical questions about our opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jjvhCs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eia7bW"&gt;Hulls did say there is “theoretically” enough data available in what Life360 sells to identify individuals, but that to the company’s knowledge it has never happened. He cited the belief that companies would casually break their contract and break the law as possible, theoretically, but frustrating to him as an idea because he thinks “it’s a pretty big step that most reputable companies are not going to do.” We asked what would happen if contracted purchasers like X-Mode are confirmed to have sold data identifiable data to the government, and while Hulls would not confirm active investigations, he says it would sue partner companies that breach the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EHyF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s report on the &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data"&gt;location data industry&lt;/a&gt; helps paint the picture of how the demand for user data is seen as an opportunity by companies like Life360. Hulls stated to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that selling location data is “an important part of our business model that allows us to keep the core Life360 services free” — citing that its features have “improved driver safety and saved numerous lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1639072537.156400"&gt;While Life360 is a safety company selling peace of mind and perhaps a better offer on your insurance, it’s also like many other companies (Google, Facebook, Roku, and Vizio come to mind) where mining the data generated by users could ultimately be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJqILI"&gt;Though both the company and Tile delivered statements that there are no &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; plans to sell Tile tracker data, real-time location information is sensitive enough that simply trusting anyone to keep it out of the wrong hands is a hard sell. Even with the ability to opt out after registering, rushed decisions to get through the signup process fast could determine who actually owns your information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch The Game Awards 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2YDsGO6dQOKfLZfVR-SDyO6n1M=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251164/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbQOlO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/"&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; are back. The awards ceremony / game conference / concert hosted by Geoff Keighley will deliver a couple hours’ worth of performances (notably, Sting will be playing), game reveals (one of which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1464812686244401153?s=20"&gt;over two years in the making&lt;/a&gt;), and almost certainly, a few new memes. There have been very few teases as to what we’ll see onstage, but don’t take that as any indication that this could be a quiet show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1THRf"&gt;A few years ago, this is where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the debut of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; was an unexpected surprise. I wouldn’t expect any game console announcements for this year’s show. What you can expect (even if you’d rather avoid it) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820270/the-game-awards-red-carpet-core-metaverse"&gt;are some metaverse happenings&lt;/a&gt; that aim to give you a more immersive way to experience the Game Awards. Speaking of topical issues, Geoff Keighley has stated that the Game Awards won’t feature NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817651/activision-blizzard-the-game-awards-harassment"&gt;nor will Activision Blizzard play any role in the show&lt;/a&gt; beyond its nominated titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M75GxQ"&gt;When are The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VOlLAW"&gt;The Game Awards will air live on Thursday, December 9th at 8PM ET / 5PM PT / 1AM GMT. That’s late for our friends in Europe, but if you’re in Japan, you’ll get to watch it first thing in the morning at 9AM. There will be a pre-show beginning a half-hour earlier than the times above, if you want to tune in then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FHn8uM"&gt;How can I watch The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fh5YVs"&gt;Look no further than the top of this page, where we’re hosting a livestream of The Game Awards from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegameawards"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (the stream will automatically go live for the 7:30PM ET pre-show). However, there are some other sites hosting it, including &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gk1ivs"&gt;It appears that Louis Vuitton is launching yet another version of its Tambour Horizon Connected Watches. According to &lt;a href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2021/12/09/louis-vuitton-tambour-horizon-light-up/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gadgets and Wearables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this one lights up thanks to 24 LED lights. It’s not dissimilar to Louis Vuitton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583644/louis-vuitton-horizon-light-up-speaker-design-price-release-date"&gt;bizarre $2,890 light-up speaker&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it belongs in a space opera. There’s a lot that could be written about this thing, from its ostentatious design to its simple feature set. But the big thing to note here is the watch may purportedly forgo Wear OS in favor of a proprietary operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUbmRz7k9C16-0H0BkJCas8_t58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076377/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_1.20.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Victoria Song&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several reports of the announcement have been taken down or redirect to other content, but remain in Google News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCf1Bm"&gt;Several other outlets initially ran the announcement, including &lt;em&gt;HypeBeast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;HypeBae&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wareable&lt;/em&gt;, but have since been taken down or now redirect to other pages. Details on the actual hardware and software were vague, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Louis Vuitton and its parent company LVMH, which confirmed the watch existed but didn’t provide further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFxyV4"&gt;So far, there’s no name for this custom-built OS. All that’s been reported is that it’s got a touchscreen and a swipe-based UI. Swiping in various directions supposedly brings up notifications, metrics, settings, and, in an interesting twist, a “My Travel” screen that stores plans and boarding passes. Given that this would be an haute couture smartwatch, there would also be customizable watch face options and fairly basic health tracking. The other odd, but perhaps telling, tidbit is that the proprietary OS was “made for iPhone” but also described as Android and HarmonyOS compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzU63B"&gt;If true, this wouldn’t be the first time a traditionally Wear OS smartwatch line quietly pivoted away from the platform. The recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787071/wearos-moto-watch-100-smartwatches"&gt;Moto Watch 100&lt;/a&gt; also decided to run proprietary software called Moto OS — even though Motorola-branded smartwatches have historically run on Wear OS. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs"&gt;Huawei Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; and the OnePlus Watch also decided to gamble on their own RTOS-based software. It’s too early to say whether this trend will last, but it hints that Wear OS’s growing pains may just be beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfweRI"&gt;It was monumental news when Google announced it was partnering with Samsung to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;create a new unified platform&lt;/a&gt; that mashed together the best of Wear OS and Tizen OS. But while it was an opportunity to unify the fragmented Android wearable space, there were a lot of caveats, too. For starters, Wear OS 3 won’t arrive for eligible smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;until mid-2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;. Keyword: Eligible. Based on Google’s official guidance and announcements from partners like Fossil, it’s pretty clear that Android smartwatches powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 chips won’t make the cut. That’s a massive hardware dilemma, as only a handful use the current Snapdragon Wear 4100 platform. It’s also troubling, considering it wasn’t until this past summer that Qualcomm seemingly realized it’d dropped the ball and announced it was working on a new wearable chipset. Basically, Wear OS still has a hardware problem. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWD8X4BlkDAelNO5q4BciGdBrFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8831969/louis_vuitton_tambour_horizon_black_42_jewellery_and_timepieces__QAAA25_PM2_Front_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Louis Vuitton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Louis Vuitton’s first smartwatch, the Tambour Horizon launched in 2017, ran Google’s operating system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xkv7wT"&gt;Case in point: Wear OS 3 worked well on Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; lineup. Those smartwatches run on Samsung’s in-house &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/newsroom/pressrelease/samsung-introduces-the-industrys-first-5nm-processor-powering-the-next-generation-of-wearables/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Exynos W920 chip&lt;/a&gt;, which runs circles around both Snapdragon Wear 3100 and 4100. So, if you’re a non-Apple smartwatch maker, you’ve got two options. You could take Fossil’s route and build a 4100-powered watch that will eventually run Wear OS 3, though not as well as Samsung’s watches. You’d also have to hope that Qualcomm manages to quickly release a wearables chipset that isn’t based on incredibly outdated technology. Or, you could just bypass the headache altogether with a proprietary OS, at the expense of more advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VtM3E"&gt;The reality is, right now, Android users are left in a lurch with few appealing options. Switching to Wear OS 3 was always going to be messy, but there’s a lot of potential from what we’ve seen of Wear OS 3 on Samsung’s watches. However, Samsung is like Apple. Its products work best if you’re knee-deep in its ecosystem. Barring a Pixel or Fitbit Wear OS watch run by a powerful Google chip (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan"&gt;may actually happen&lt;/a&gt;), non-Samsung users are likely going to have to wait a while for an equivalent smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UL0fa"&gt;In the interim, it looks increasingly likely we’ll see more Android-friendly smartwatches running proprietary software. That’s not necessarily bad. The Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, and Huawei Watch 3 are all examples of serviceable smartwatches that chose this route. Then again, so did the OnePlus Watch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;that was a bug-ridden nightmare at launch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfeSkl"&gt;Essentially, it’s all up in the air. We won’t be able to confirm whether Wear OS will be missing from the new Louis Vuitton smartwatch until it officially launches. We also won’t know how Wear OS 3 will fare in the long run for quite some time. The only thing we can say with utmost certainty is don’t buy a new 3100-powered smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says bug with Teams and Android can cause 911 calls to fail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOBeJ4WpBRanuS9TvKelaAsT0aQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250825/jbareham_181010_2989_0455.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wufCfX"&gt;Last week, a Reddit user reported that they &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/"&gt;weren’t able to call 911 using their Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; and later said they were working with Google support to figure out the issue. Yesterday, Google &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;announced what was causing the issue&lt;/a&gt; in a reply to the post: an “unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/08/android-emergency-calling-bug/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Auq1G4"&gt;In its comment, Google says that the bug happens when someone is using Android 10 or later and has Teams installed but isn’t logged into the app. The company says that Microsoft will be releasing an update to Teams “soon” to prevent the issue and that there’s an update to Android coming January 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vur50g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re running Android 10 or above and aren’t logged into Teams, uninstall it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvf9I"&gt;Needless to say, you should uninstall Teams until the update is available if you’re not planning on logging into the app. If you have logged into it at one point but don’t use it frequently, you should also go ahead and double-check that you’re still logged in as well. Even though the bug was reported on the Pixel subreddit, Google recommends that you should keep an eye out for the Teams update if you have “any Android device” running Android 10 or up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVGVP"&gt;As many commenters pointed out, it’s a bit concerning that any app can make it so you can’t contact emergency services. Google does say it’s only received one report about this bug, but it’s a pretty niche set of circumstances that cause the bug (there’s really no reason to have Teams installed if you’re not logged into it). If it had been a more common interaction, it could’ve really caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMzSr5"&gt;Google says it’ll update its Reddit comment when the Teams update is rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Utility companies will no longer share data with ICE — but many loopholes remain </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcMuc42XqnKrHFw6ecX__xRvhUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250777/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="87VqSj"&gt;A nationwide group of companies from the power, water, cable TV, and telecommunications sectors have agreed that they will no longer sell customer information to data brokers used by ICE and law enforcement agencies. The news has been hailed as an important step by privacy advocates, who have long criticized the practice as a privacy violation that lets law enforcement obtain personal information from third parties without appropriate review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZJwRJ"&gt;The announcement comes from a letter sent Wednesday by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/08/utility-data-government-tracking/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0rFOr"&gt;The companies concerned belong to the National Consumer Telecom &amp;amp; Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), a credit reporting agency that lets members log the payment histories of their customers in a shared central database. This data was then shared with credit bureau Equifax, which uses such payment information records in credit score reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kiOEO"&gt;However, the same data was then resold by Equifax to &lt;a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/clear-investigation-software"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/a&gt; — an extensive database of personal information that was used by ICE investigators, as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/26/ice-private-utility-data/"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZXIvw"&gt;According to the letter sent by Sen. Wyden, the NCTUE directed Equifax to stop selling data to CLEAR as of October 2021. However, any customer data in the database before this point will remain accessible and includes some information — such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers — that will not change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mw28R"&gt;Wyden’s letter asks the CFPB to prevent credit agencies from selling personal data to law enforcement agencies via data brokers — a practice that the senator has campaigned against for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc39wI"&gt;“Every branch of government has ignored the corrosive effect of data brokers for decades,” said Sen. Wyden in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Investigations by journalists, researchers and my office have finally shined a light on just how widespread the sale of Americans private data is. I’ve told anyone who will listen that Congress’s top tech priority should be passing strong legislation to protect Americans’ privacy and security. I hope Democrats don’t pass on the chance to put privacy protections into black letter law until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0USFlj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rrv9Tb"&gt;The use of data obtained from third-party brokers in law enforcement has drawn strong criticism from privacy advocates, since it effectively creates a loophole that lets agencies skirt processes of judicial review, such as the need to obtain a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVPMLL"&gt;“Part of why utility records are so insidious is that you can opt out of a lot of digital services, but it’s hard to opt out of having electricity or running water,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP). “To make those lifeline utilities yet another tracking tool for ICE put undocumented families in an intolerable position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igqzzZ"&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution,” Cahn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU3OXj"&gt;The CLEAR database, which is operated by media company Thomson Reuters, is currently subject to a &lt;a href="https://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Thomson-Reuters-CLEAR-class-action-lawsuit.pdf"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in California by STOP, Gibbs Law Group, Justice Catalyst Law, and Gupta Wessler PLLC. The lawsuit contends that the sale of information in the database violates the privacy of California residents. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit from Thomson Reuters was &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-advances-privacy-claims-over-reuters-database/"&gt;rejected by a judge in April&lt;/a&gt;. The case is currently at the discovery phase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new year-end live event, Escape2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooGePdsoPo3VwWxLUToyJLwfQBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250714/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQqmJa"&gt;YouTube will host a 24-hour interactive live event featuring musicians and creators to look back on the platform’s biggest trends and videos of 2021, the company announced today. The event, called Escape2021, will have three chapters, the first of which begins on December 16th at midnight ET. The goal of Escape2021: liberate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJRHqCRvD0c"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; from the confines of her bedroom and studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oSqOA"&gt;Escape2021 replaces YouTube Rewind, a high-production recap video YouTube published at the end of each year that had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;derided by creators&lt;/a&gt; for sanitizing the platform to appeal to advertisers. The company officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on Rewind in October, saying it would “refocus our energies” to create different kinds of productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyDbmD"&gt;The event seems to be an attempt by YouTube to offer more immersive online experiences, like when fans watched &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-army-butter-melting-video-9564987/"&gt;butter melt&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a new BTS song. YouTube says there will be trivia questions, trend-based challenges, and “real-time live experiences,” all leading up to musical performances. One example of a challenge, echoing the BTS livestream, will require viewers to identify what butter sculptures the band has melted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASw5Bl"&gt;YouTube says the event will include performances and appearances from BTS, Doja Cat, and Mark Rober, among others. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter could bring universal casting that actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSjLQu7b-61QZ8vRbvaiJ56pc5g=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249408/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This Amazon-led casting standard for TVs could challenge Apple AirPlay and Google Cast &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eU6aaf"&gt;The new smart home standard Matter is making a lot of grand promises, chief among them are fixing the interoperability mess the smart home is currently in and making Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon talk to each other. Big jobs. But it’s also tackling one of the other pain points in the connected home: TV control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm1PBy"&gt;One part of the new connectivity protocol is a specification for televisions and streaming video players. This means that Matter could become yet another way to control content in our homes. But, with its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter’s TV spec has the potential to replace proprietary casting systems, like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Cast, and finally free our TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2niZc"&gt;Matter TV, as we’ll call it for wont of an official name, will allow control of a television’s core functions — volume up / down, changing the channel, controlling inputs and outputs, and switching between HDMI ports. “But importantly, you can also do casting,” Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oENWS1"&gt;“This is an area with at least five proprietary protocols today,” he says. “The result is a complete opportunity loss for everyone.” Not to mention major headaches for users as they grapple with which voice assistant can get this content and which remote will control that streaming stick. Amazon is leading the effort to define the specification for Matter — unsurprising, as it is currently the only large player without a proprietary way to cast content from a smartphone to a TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sv-CBjF74efHYHqQaY3CTpNuA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13262367/jbareham_180726_2773_0087.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controlling our smart TVs can feel anything but smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1AsPEc"&gt;“Control of media is one of the most popular use cases for Alexa,” says DeCenzo, who told me Amazon is working with the different industry leaders in the fields of smart TVs, streaming video players, and content providers to help them adopt Matter. The goal is so that “customers can have a consistent way to use voice control and to launch their favorite content on those screens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0NyUx"&gt;While the Matter TV specification doesn’t explicitly call out voice control, the idea here is standardization. One protocol for all device communication, everything will talk to everything else using the same language, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made it. Ultimately, this means you will be able to use your control interface of choice (a voice assistant, remote control, or smartphone / tablet app) with all your streaming content devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7HxJWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter could finally free our TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rguZA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;When Matter arrives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the Matter TV specification will use app-to-app communication, at least until the TVs and streaming video players become Matter enabled. The spec supports casting from a Matter client (e.g., a remote, a smart speaker, or a phone app) to an app running on a Matter-enabled TV or video player device, explains DeCenzo. It also supports URL-based casting, which means a Matter client can cast to a TV even when there’s no app for that client, if the TV supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH, an international standard for streaming) or HLS DRM streams (HLS is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple and widely supported across Android devices and browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tus8PG"&gt;The capability could go beyond just entertainment and be used to enable smart home notifications, says Chris LaPré of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that oversees the new standard. For example, it could cast a message from your connected doorbell to your smart TV, notifying you that someone is at the door. It could potentially show you the video feed, too, something of a workaround for including video feeds in Matter, since cameras are not part of the first device rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ietivWcwo5KkGDZsTA4bL1fY9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074285/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA / Matter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter-enabled devices will have the Matter logo on them to indicate they’re compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="to2vl9"&gt;Intriguingly, LaPré posited that the specification could allow for the use of context when delivering these messages, such as notifying you from the smart speaker in the room you are in that your laundry is done. “It can be about casting anything, smart home notifications, local video — all it needs is a URL to pull content from,” says LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hntmBy"&gt;The technology here is not system-level specific, as with Apple’s AirPlay. It appears to be more akin to Google’s Cast, where apps will need to build support for it, at least initially. But like AirPlay, and as with all Matter communications, it’s entirely local. Communication from device to device uses Matter as the channel. At launch, Matter will use ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread as its communication protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s30Vfu"&gt;The requirement for the app makers — such as Hulu and Netflix, who aren’t currently members of the CSA — to build Matter support could make this something of a non-starter initially. Beyond Amazon and its Prime Video and Google with YouTube, few of the major streaming content providers are part of the CSA, and the app developer will initially need to add Matter support to both the app in the phone or casting device (for example, a smart speaker, laptop, or smartphone) and the app in the receiving device (TV, streaming stick, smart display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCw2XM"&gt;“You can have communication directly from the Prime Video app on my phone to the Prime Video app that’s on the TV,” explains DeCenzo. Going forward, according to LaPré, the streaming video players and TVs will have Matter built into the devices themselves, and at this point the apps in the receiving device won’t need to be Matter-enabled. It seems likely Amazon will enable Matter on its Fire TV devices, and the company has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;committed to upgrading all its smart speakers to support Matter&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung, TCL, Panasonic, and LG are all involved with Matter, as are Apple and Google. However, according to the list of companies on the &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;Matter website&lt;/a&gt;, Vizio, Sony, Toshiba, and Roku are a few notable hardware players that are not yet signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JleYxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a consistent way to use voice control to launch content on any screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcAKqp"&gt;The main goal, however, is part of Matter’s overarching promise: avoiding manufacturer lock-in. People should be able to buy whichever device they choose and it should be able to talk to all the other connected devices in their home, regardless of who made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqOY9"&gt;For example, if both were Matter-enabled you should be able to control an LG TV from a Samsung smartphone, and that LG TV should be able to receive a message from a Miele smart washer that the laundry is done. But, and this is a big but, nothing in the overall Matter spec is a requirement. A company that is on board with Matter as a whole is under no obligation to adopt a certain device specification that they don’t need or want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEcMbI"&gt;This means that Apple and Google do not have to adopt the Matter TV specification if they don’t want to (but if they do, they have to adopt it all, including casting). LaPré says both companies have “blessed this” as part of the spec (Matter is governed by members of the CSA who vote on the specifications). Whether they will adopt it remains to be seen. But if Amazon does, which seems like a good bet, it should mean you can use Matter to cast from your Amazon Prime app on your iPhone to your Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1CPHb"&gt;I reached out to both Google and Apple about this specification and how it would impact their current offerings. Both companies have committed to supporting Matter in their respective smart home ecosystems and both are members of the CSA. Kevin Po of Google said in an email that “Google Assistant will support Matter (eg. on/off, play/pause, app launch etc.) at parity with our current Works With Assistant offering.” Apple did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5nr5N9"&gt;Po went on to reiterate that Google Cast remains Google’s preferred method for sending media via apps and voice to Chromecasts, speakers, and displays. As, we can only assume at this stage, will Airplay be Apple’s “preferred method.” But what your preferred method will be could very soon involve a lot more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKv5qW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Thursday, December 9th, 1:20PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that if a company chooses to adopt the Matter TV spec, it will need to adopt all of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34SCdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s big ambitions could be its Achilles’ heel in the Arm deal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ch5WdR"&gt;Nvidia has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;trying to buy Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt; for over a year now — but this week, the acquisition was hit with its biggest roadblock yet. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/d09404_part_3_complaint_public_version.pdf"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission laid out the case&lt;/a&gt; to stop the merger from going through, arguing that the deal would “stifle competing next-generation technologies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XcTeQ"&gt;It’s the most significant attempt to reign in Big Tech yet under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Lina Khan’s term as FTC chair&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a lot at stake, both for the FTC and the electronics industry at large. Arm is a hugely important company; the company’s chip designs touch hundreds of billions of devices, including CPUs and ISPs for modern cars, embedded chipsets for wearable and medical devices, smart home gadgets like thermostats and routers, and of course, smartphone and laptop processors. The question of who controls it will have massive implications for all of them — and the FTC’s case now seems like it’ll be ​​the biggest barrier to the acquisition going through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7aHB4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The FTC is suing to block Nvidia’s $40 billion purchase of Arm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814633/nvidia-arm-purchase-semiconductor-ftc-40-billion-lawsuit-block-deal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RaL7X1"&gt;Nvidia already competes in at least some of the same fields as Arm licensees. The FTC and other regulators in the EU and UK are concerned that, because of that involvement, Nvidia could influence Arm’s future product development. It’s particularly worried that Nvidia would use its control over Arm to advance its own interests in emerging markets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/4/12/22380065/nvidia-grace-cpu-arm-data-center-ai-hpc"&gt;data centers&lt;/a&gt; and autonomous vehicles, instead of working to ensure that all the companies that use Arm designs to compete with Nvidia in those fields can continue to do so on an equal playing field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYaJga"&gt;Crucially, Arm doesn’t actually make its own chips: rather, it sells both licenses for companies to design their own chips that use Arm’s architecture (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; for Macs), in addition to selling entire CPU and GPU designs (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1 CPU&lt;/a&gt; and Mali GPUs found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google Tensor&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung Exynos 2100). But Arm’s architectures — which offer better power efficiency and customization options for device manufacturers — have steadily become a critical part of the computing landscape. It’s Arm’s technology, not the traditional x86 designs used by Intel and AMD, that has fueled the massive growth of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices over the past two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz4Tfl"&gt;The FTC makes its case by looking at three specific areas where Nvidia already licenses Arm’s technology: Nvidia’s advanced driver assistance chips and two types of data center chips. One of those data center chips is particularly important: the &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/10/29/what-is-a-smartnic/"&gt;DPU-based (data processing unit) SmartNIC&lt;/a&gt;, a core component of data center networking infrastructure, which provides both processing (thanks to Arm cores) and network interfacing for secure cloud infrastructure. Nvidia thinks they’re going to be a big deal, setting up that DPUs are set to be the “third pillar” of computing infrastructure, alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. And virtually everyone that makes DPU SmartNICs — even Intel, the biggest x86 chip company around — uses Arm technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZDVcpU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even Intel, the biggest x86 chip company around — uses Arm technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgj0Hl"&gt;It’s a similar case for automotive vehicle assistance. Arm’s technology is used in virtually all the chips for enabling Level 2 and Level 3 assistive features in cars (which covers basic automated tasks like acceleration or lane changing while still having a human operator on standby). With the exception of Intel-owned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822279/intel-mobileye-ipo-2022-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, every major chip in this field uses Arm — including Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOLAsZ"&gt;There are a couple of things to note here. The FTC is being very strategic in its examples, choosing areas that have a clear impact on the broader tech industry. But these three licensing deals also represent a very small part of Arm’s business. &lt;a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/annual_reports/annual-report_fy2020_01_en.pdf"&gt;As a SoftBank presentation&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 shows, its bread and butter is focused in mobile phones (where it dominates more than 90 percent of the market) and IoT application processors. On the automotive side, Arm claims to have 75 percent market share but doesn’t distinguish how much of that is for infotainment systems versus the kinds of driver assistance applications that the FTC is concerned about. And its presence in data centers is virtually nonexistent: Arm’s technology has just a 5 percent market share there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGJZvI"&gt;The FTC is making a broad case here — that a combined Nvidia / Arm would be willing to make moves that would hurt its competitors that rely on Arm’s architecture or designs, because the profits it could generate from better succeeding in these markets would outweigh the losses from licensees. But it’s relying on very specific parts of the business, which seems to open the door for some kind of compromise that would spin off the conflicting parts of the business while allowing the bulk of the acquisition to go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9mx7S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC has a long road ahead of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4D7Ku"&gt;In practice, that kind of compromise has been hard to achieve. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-the-ftc-rejected-nvidias-antitrust-settlement-for-75-billion-arm-deal"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia offered to spin out an independent licensing company for licensing out designs in an attempt to mollify regulators, but the plan failed due to concerns that Nvidia would still control Arm’s development of new products. So while Nvidia could try to divest itself of, say, Arm’s data center technology, thanks to the common architecture shared by Arm’s products, it would still be in charge of what kinds of features Arm would focus on to include in those chip designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyKJfe"&gt;The FTC also highlights the fact that Nvidia would gain access to Arm’s customer list and be privy to sensitive information that companies share with Arm. “Nvidia’s ownership of Arm would fundamentally upend Arm’s status as a neutral partner and, at the same time, enable Nvidia to obtain access to its rivals’ competitively sensitive information.” The regulatory group also notes that Arm licensees that compete with Nvidia might be less willing to work with the company to help further improve Arm, in addition to skewing future development of Arm’s products in directions that benefit Nvidia specifically, rather than the broader Arm ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCpUTz"&gt;Of all the FTC’s arguments, Nvidia seems most prepared for this one: back when the deal was first announced, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.” The company has since reiterated that the merger would “boost competition, [and] create more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoayVN"&gt;This puts the FTC in a delicate position as it heads to court. But the specific examples that regulators are using to prove it are very specific and less integral to Arm’s overall business strategy than, say, concerns about competition for its major CPU and GPU products. After decades of relatively lax oversight, it’s hard to say how any antitrust case will fare in court — so even the slightest weakness in the case could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eneLPE"&gt;On the other hand, the FTC also doesn’t necessarily have to win to block the deal. It just has to hold out long enough that Nvidia decides that the deal isn’t worth the trouble, especially since Nvidia’s deal with current Arm owner SoftBank only gives the US chip company until the end of 2022 to clear regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Gj5gF"&gt;Behind all of it is a very nervous electronics industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, and Tesla have all objected to the deal, and the concerns that Nvidia ownership could influence Arm’s development and stifle innovation are very real. The only question now is whether the FTC can make the case work in court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA launches new X-ray mission to study black holes and exploding stars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo showing the imaging x-ray polarimetry explorer that launched in space early Thursday morning" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0fLWv5AG8lwXMv0CNSyQz-QlB8=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250650/ixpe_003.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sRG9a5"&gt;On Thursday morning, NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-launches-new-mission-to-explore-universe-s-most-dramatic-objects"&gt;successfully launched&lt;/a&gt; into space on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The two-year mission, a joint effort with the Italian Space Agency, is NASA’s first mission dedicated to studying and measuring X-ray polarization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0iAHm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ixpe/overview.html"&gt;pioneering mission&lt;/a&gt; will allow NASA to look into the origins of X-ray light, a form of high energy light produced during some of the most extreme celestial events like supernova explosions and violent collisions. The mission builds on the work done by the &lt;a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/"&gt;Chandra X-ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s flagship X-ray astronomy mission, which launched in 1999 and has imaged the remnants of exploded stars, discovered black holes, and more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The IXPE will provide more insight into the astrophysical phenomena Chandra has studied in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQulvr"&gt;The IXPE will begin operations in January, NASA reports. During its first year, IXPE will study about 40 celestial objects with detailed follow-up observations in its second year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci6PiA"&gt;The IXPE mission consists of three identical telescopes containing mirrors that will collect X-rays emanating from celestial objects, like supermassive black holes, and focus them onto detectors that can measure their polarization. Polarized light is light whose vibrations are all aligned in a single direction, unlike the visible light from a lightbulb, which scatters in every direction. By studying its properties, astronomers can learn more about what sort of environment it came from and passed through on its journey throughout the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gWO5S"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ixpe/overview.html"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the mission will provide long-awaited answers to questions like how black holes spin, whether the black hole at the center of our galaxy was actively feeding on surrounding material in the past, and why pulsars emit so much X-ray light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4X6ZoM"&gt;The IXPE observatory separated from the rocket about 33 minutes into flight before unfurling its solar arrays and entering an orbit around Earth’s equator. Forty minutes after the launch, mission operators received the first set of telemetry data from the spacecraft, NASA wrote in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuG9p0"&gt;Though an overshadowed one, the IXPE launch is a major victory for NASA as the agency preps for the &lt;a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/launch.html"&gt;December 22nd launch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;James Webb Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s next major eyes in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
