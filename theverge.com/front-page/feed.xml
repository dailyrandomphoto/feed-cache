    <title>AT&amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject FAA request to delay 5G expansions scheduled to start January 5th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="27VCuY"&gt;In an ongoing battle pitting the FAA and airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834080/5g-rollout-delay-faa-fcc-letter"&gt;against the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T over their planned launch of mid-band 5G service, the mobile carriers are declining a request by the FAA for a two-week delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKG5X6"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYGP4g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dqEUXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank goodness: No more delays for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#5G&lt;/a&gt; in C-Band! We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon CEOs reject U.S. request for 5G deployment delay &lt;a href="https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq"&gt;https://t.co/AJVZoCofuq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike O’Rielly (@MPORielly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLKcpu"&gt;On Friday, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862481/buttigieg-faa-request-two-week-5g-delay-aircraft-safety"&gt;asking them to push back plans to start commercial deployment on January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. The air travel regulators said they’d use that time to identify priority airports, notify flights, and line up alternate methods of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcW0It"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-verizon-ceos-reject-us-request-5g-deployment-delay-2022-01-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that in a response letter today from the two CEOs, the companies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;had already ceded to a 30-day delay request&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to reduce the power of their signals, said no. They propose to start using the C-band spectrum to expand their 5G services, but with a commitment to avoid deployment around certain airports for six months, saying a similar system is already in place in France. However, that commitment relies “on the condition that the FAA and the aviation industry are committed to doing the same without escalating their grievances, unfounded as they are, in other venues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSPJju"&gt;In the letter (included below), they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HS7GC8"&gt;“Now, on the evening of New Year’s Eve, just five days before the C-Band spectrum will be deployed, we received your letter asking us to take still more voluntary steps - to the detriment of our millions of consumer, business and government customers - to once again assist the aviation industry and the FAA after failing to resolve issues in that costly 30-day delay period, which we never considered to be an initial one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXEdKr"&gt;“At its core, your proposed framework asks that we agree to transfer oversight of our companies’ multi-billion dollar investment in 50 unnamed metropolitan areas representing the lion’s share of the U.S. population to the FAA for an undetermined number of months or years. Even worse, the proposal is directed to only two companies, regardless of the terms of licenses auctioned and granted, and to the exception of every other company and industry within the purview of the FCC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9i3XL1"&gt;“...we will again volunteer, in the spirit of cooperation and good faith, to alter our use of the C-Band spectrum during the same six-month period (unless we and the FAA determine that these voluntary limits should be relaxed sooner). Specifically, for six months, until July 5, 2022, we will adopt the same C-Band radio exclusion zones that are already in use in France, with slight adaptation to reflect the modest technical differences in how C-band is being deployed in the two countries. That approach – which is one of the most conservative in the world – would include extensive exclusion zones around the runways at certain airports. The effect would be to further reduce C-band signal levels by at least 10 times on the runway or during the last mile of final approach and the first mile after takeoff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4h9nS"&gt;FCC commissioner Mike O’Reilly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MPORielly/status/1477713404710244355"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the letter, saying, “We can have safe wireless and safe flights. Reasoned people should accept US wireless industry not have more C-Band limitations than France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWfiVb"&gt;At issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;is the idea&lt;/a&gt; that guided landing systems for aircraft “could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, but the bands are close enough that the fear exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcqWym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out that the trade group &lt;a href="https://www.airlines.org/"&gt;Airlines for America&lt;/a&gt; that represents American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta, FedEx, and UPS, among others, has threatened to go to court on Monday if the FCC does not take action on the 5G rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2zopI"&gt;So far, the FAA’s response to the letter is that “We are reviewing the latest letter from the wireless companies on how to mitigate interference from 5G C-band transmissions. U.S. aviation safety standards will guide our next actions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft issues a fix for Exchange Y2K22 bug that shut down company emails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehK6HL20PSAwFOmtzIsRAyfqHQc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339887/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gYpL8"&gt;If you woke up on January 1st, 2022, and found that your work email’s inbox was unusually empty, you aren’t alone. Microsoft rang in the New Year with a bug that prevents Exchange servers from sending emails, but fortunately, a fix has since been issued, as detailed in a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-emergency-fix-for-exchange-year-2022-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V368m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLckVJ"&gt;“The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year and is not a failure of the AV engine itself,” Microsoft explains in &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/email-stuck-in-exchange-on-premises-transport-queues/ba-p/3049447"&gt;a post on its Tech Community forum&lt;/a&gt;. “The version checking performed against the signature file is causing the malware engine to crash, resulting in messages being stuck in transport queues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNgPrt"&gt;Microsoft outlines the solution to the problem in its post, requiring administrators to either implement the fix manually or apply an automated script. The post also contains a detailed FAQ, noting that the solution “will take some time” for administrators to implement. And depending on how many emails are stuck in the queue, it may take a while for the messages to land in their intended recipients’ inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4Mz7r"&gt;Problems started cropping up at midnight on January 1st, with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rt91z6/exchange_2019_antimalware_bad_update/"&gt;an Exchange administrator on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; calling attention to the issue. As explained by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-exchange-year-2022-bug-in-fip-fs-breaks-email-delivery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, administrators began noticing error messages in the Exchange Server’s Event Log, such as “The FIP-FS Scan Process failed initialization. Error: 0x8004005. Error Details: Unspecified Error” or “Error Code: 0x80004005. Error Description: Can’t convert “2201010001” to long.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIW88v"&gt;Administrators were forced to come up with alternate solutions during the time it took for Microsoft to address the issue, but now that the company has released an official fix, it looks like the Y2K22 crisis is over.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered close to one million vehicles in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6KjI9crz_PpzkuocI-ngJ8McHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339586/jbareham_180213_2301_0109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGNZG2"&gt;Tesla delivered a record 936,172 vehicles in 2021, as outlined in a &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;report from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, representing an 87 percent increase over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;499,550 vehicle deliveries Tesla made in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zRznkj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Great work by Tesla team worldwide! &lt;a href="https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp"&gt;https://t.co/lsDTCJtMrp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1477700424933253123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFS2cd"&gt;The company managed to deliver 308,600 cars in the last quarter of 2021 alone, up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;241,300 deliveries in the third quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Of those deliveries, 11,750 were for the Model S and X, while 296,850 were for the Model 3 and Y. Both the Model 3 and Y also made up the majority of deliveries throughout the entire year at 936,172 shipments, compared to the 24,964 Model S and X deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1leKyH"&gt;Tesla previously stated that it plans on increasing its deliveries by about 50 percent every year, and although it didn’t hit one million shipments, it has still surpassed its annual growth goal. In November, an internal memo revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807387/tesla-quarterly-deliveries-end-rush-elon-musk-memo"&gt;told his employees to stop rushing&lt;/a&gt; to make deliveries by the end of the quarter and to instead focus on cutting costs, noting that he expected a wave of vehicles from Tesla’s factories in California and China to reach customers in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAcH8e"&gt;The ongoing chip shortage has caused a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787339/chevrolet-trucks-heated-seats-2022-models-chip-shortage-supply-chain-issues"&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to pump their brakes, Tesla included. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla rewrote its own software&lt;/a&gt; to help mitigate the impact of the shortage, and also had to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-temporarily-halted-u-s-production-over-parts-shortage-11614295075"&gt;shut down production at its California plant&lt;/a&gt; in February. Some customers even reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;USB ports were missing&lt;/a&gt; in their vehicles, potentially because of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBvReC"&gt;Despite all this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla’s value exceeded $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in October after rental car company Hertz added 100,000 Teslas to its fleet. The company even had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;most profitable quarter ever&lt;/a&gt; in the third quarter of 2021, but that may change, considering that earnings for the final quarter of 2021 have not yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account over COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Republicans Hold Press Conference On Biden Administration’s Agenda" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_hzYIcVSq41Esbnggm55wZMayY=/0x3:8024x5352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70339167/1353869875.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gX8gH"&gt;Twitter has permanently suspended Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account for repeatedly violating the platform’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy"&gt;rules on COVID-19 misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, as noted in a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-suspension/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since the ban only affects Greene’s personal Twitter account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee"&gt;@mtgreenee&lt;/a&gt;, she can still access and tweet from her governmental account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG"&gt;@RepMTG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjEzGq"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter spokesperson Katie Rosborough explains that the platform “permanently suspended” Greene’s account “for repeated violations” of the platform’s COVID-19 policies. “We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KFJmI0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter implemented a five-strike system for COVID-19 misinformation last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="15W4ec"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system"&gt;Twitter implemented a five-strike system&lt;/a&gt; in March 2021, which puts a lock on users’ accounts if they post tweets containing misinformation about COVID-19 — the more strikes a user accrues, the longer they're temporarily barred from their account. If a user receives five strikes, however, their account gets permanently suspended. Twitter didn’t confirm which tweet was Greene’s final strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuhjQv"&gt;Greene responded to the situation &lt;a href="https://t.me/RealMarjorieGreene/1432"&gt;in a post on Telegram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarjorieTaylorGreene/photos/a.1809748895981879/2911583609131730/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. “Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth,” Greene states. “Social media platforms can’t stop the truth from being spread far and wide.” She also claims she was suspended for tweeting out data from the &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)&lt;/a&gt;, a database that stores information about potential adverse reactions to vaccines — including the COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtKtcw"&gt;Last year, Greene was suspended from Twitter several times for violating the platform's policies. Her account was temporarily banned for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/twitter-temporarily-suspends-gop-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-n1254557"&gt;violating Twitter’s civic integrity policy&lt;/a&gt;, and was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html"&gt;later suspended&lt;/a&gt; on two &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/twitter-temporarily-suspends-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-over-false-covid-n1276414"&gt;separate occasions&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting misleading information about COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new smart monitor can control your IoT devices, stream games, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5wVEnX0rwO584TlhacItMi7nPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338930/smartmonitorm8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yotMIp"&gt;Samsung is adding onto its lineup of smart monitors with the 4K 32-inch M8. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450796/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-new-sizes-43-inch"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; on sale, this new one can deliver smart TV-like functionality, including offering access to streaming apps, in addition to being able to plug into a computer like normal monitors. The company hasn’t revealed a release date or price, but the initial details we’ve learned prove that Samsung is going a few steps further with the M8 to make it even more useful to a variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LUPSf"&gt;This smart monitor is 11.4mm-thick, which Samsung says is significantly thinner than prior models. Perhaps the most impressive feature is its magnetic and moveable SlimFit camera that can attach to the monitor for video calls. The monitor itself supports video chat apps like Google Duo. With Samsung’s other smart monitors, you need to bring your own webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6MKWL4bOX__PWSkVGsWhP-jsz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23139309/m82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VyMP3Z"&gt;Samsung’s also integrating a SmartThings IoT Hub into the M8, allowing you to see a floor map of your various smart devices and control them directly from the smart monitor. Samsung says the M8 also has a new feature called Workspace, which gathers work-related web services, like Microsoft 365, into an intuitive hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9C1bR"&gt;One other new feature is Game Home, which turns the M8 into a cloud game streaming monitor. Samsung says that owners will be able to use the M8 to stream games from game streaming services, and even connect wireless controllers to it. Though, it stopped short of naming services or controllers it’ll support. The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information will be shared about this feature closer to its launch later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWz9AI"&gt;Samsung hasn’t shared all of the ports the M8 will feature, though it mentioned that it has a USB-C port that can support 65W charging passthrough. Nor has it mentioned price or availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4ax09"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624053"&gt;The company also announced a 32-inch Odyssey Neo G8 curved gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; ahead of CES 2022. It features 4K resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, which Samsung says it’s the first to achieve on a 1000R curved monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announced a smaller 4K version of its curviest, best-looking gaming monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cwp9x_XgHyOe_xCGNdWmkGS0qg=/0x0:4757x3171/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338912/odysseyneog8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naES2u"&gt;Samsung has announced a smaller version of its Odyssey Neo curved gaming monitor. The Odyssey Neo G8 is a 32-inch gaming monitor with the same 1000R curvature of the $2,500 49-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. The R stands for radius and, compared to 1800R and 1500R curvature, which are both common in the monitor market, Samsung specializes in the  1000R curvature that’s far more, well, curvy. It makes 1800R look like a flat panel by comparison. The G8 similarly has 2,000 nits of peak brightness and promises brilliant picture quality with its Quantum Mini-LED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blHF8P"&gt;Samsung hasn’t shared a price or a release date for the Odyssey Neo G8, but it’s offering up just a few images and details until a later date. Aside from the difference in size, the Odyssey Neo G8 has a similar design language to the G9, though the key difference is that the G8 boosts the resolution from QHD Plus to 4K. Notably, Samsung says this is the first 4K monitor to support a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync tech, so your games should run stutter- and tear-free, assuming your GPU’s powerful enough to push 4K resolution at fast frame rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VXxxiX"&gt;Samsung has opted to share this news just before the onslaught of CES 2022 announcements, though we’ll have to wait until after the trade show to find out more about the Odyssey Neo G8, like price and availability. Until then, check out the other monitor that Samsung just announced: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624070"&gt;the M8 smart monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2MZr9hKJFLErqLATTZzsy5XyxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70338848/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6y4qD"&gt;The second-generation AirPods Pro may support Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), and could even come with a case that makes a sound to help you find it, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a note to investors seen by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/02/airpods-pro-2-charging-case-trackable-like-airtag-may-come-with-health-sensors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/02/kuo-airpods-pro-2-to-offer-lossless-support-new-form-factor-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aogMFl"&gt;There currently isn’t an AirPods model that supports lossless audio, a form of file compression that preserves all of the data in the original audio file, resulting in higher quality sound. Each AirPods model — even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;pricey AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; — uses Bluetooth to deliver audio, which limits the devices to using Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), a lossy form of audio compression. Thus far, the only Apple devices that can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;lossless audio on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; (and elsewhere) include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV 4K, and Apple HomePod. The main downside to lossless audio is that its files take up more storage space on your device, and streaming it online can quickly eat up mobile data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dZtNl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdZRpc"&gt;If the AirPods Pro 2 does support ALAC, Apple will either have to ditch Bluetooth or jump over some of the technology’s hurdles to accomplish that. The limitations of Bluetooth were brought up in &lt;a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/is-bluetooth-holding-back-apples-airpods-we-asked-the-man-who-made-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Hi-Fi’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s recent interview with Gary Geaves, the vice president of acoustics at Apple. During the interview, Geaves said the company will need to work hard to get the most out of Bluetooth technology, and also noted that “there’s a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth,” but “more bandwidth” would be ideal — a potential hint of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERAT6V"&gt;As for the possibility of a charging case that emits sound, this may help you find your case if it’s ever separated from your AirPods — right now, only the AirPods themselves make a noise when you try to locate them via the Find My app. Also noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo predicts that the AirPods Pro 2 could sport a redesign and may have a focus on fitness, something that was &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;previously rumored by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Kuo says that Apple may release the AirPods Pro 2 in the fourth quarter of 2022, about three years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;release of the first AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYucPg0qYu900_3P4LbMaD3i__Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337261/vpavic_4176_20200905_0114.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mX5DZJ"&gt;We are officially in 2022. Know what that means? That’s right: It means Microsoft has failed at its stated goal of bringing Android 11 to the Surface Duo by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je2iK7"&gt;Attentive readers may recall that Microsoft said the following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;this past September&lt;/a&gt;: “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.” Okay, so the company wasn’t exactly &lt;em&gt;promising&lt;/em&gt; Android 11 by the end of 2021 — but that was the heavily implied intention, and it likely gave some Surface Duo users a lot of hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="leiZWq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pB5Ox"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported, Duo devices still haven’t received Android 11. While this may be disappointing to the owners of those devices, it’s also not without precedent. Update hiccups are par for the course with Android — all kinds of manufacturers consistently fail to get them out in a timely manner. “The story on upgrades is the same today as it was a decade ago: first-party Google devices get updated quickly, everything else takes months or doesn’t get updated at all,” summarized &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Dieter Bohn in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;a 2019 newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE9SI4"&gt;Microsoft also needs to make Android work with additional controls and functionality in order to accommodate the Duo’s two screens — Android, as an operating system, is “woefully unprepared for devices like the Surface Duo,” Bohn noted in his&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt; review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. One might expect such a product to take a bit to roll out. Still, Duo users haven’t received major software improvements since the device launched 15 months ago — and that’s a long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6cMdQ"&gt;Microsoft has not yet responded to a request for comment, and &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; claims to have gotten a “useless no comment” in response to their inquiry. Fortunately, &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; has heard from sources that “the Android 11 update for Surface Duo is in fact done and should begin rolling out once the update has been certified by Google and AT&amp;amp;T.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oL5U0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozvqiJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix promises ‘decentralized games’ in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Smash Bros. Cloud" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9-lV3XQCiAsEMXjRGgSBtS5Goc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337245/WiiU_SuperSmashBros_111215_screen_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjLClb"&gt;What would a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; look like if it were partly powered by the blockchain, so gamers could make money from their contributions? You may get to find out: Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda has revealed that the company’s New Year’s resolution is to release “decentralized games” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1vvSc"&gt;While you won’t find any details &lt;a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html"&gt;in Masuda’s letter discussing the company’s strategy for the new year&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a good sense of his cautious-but-optimistic stance — not surprising, given how &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"&gt;other game companies&lt;/a&gt; that recently Leeroy Jenkins’d their way into NFTs saw such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;immediate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;whiplash&lt;/a&gt; you could practically feel the vibrations over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1N2hN"&gt;Here’s the most relevant section, which comes near the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YT7ivP"&gt;From having fun to earning to contributing, a wide variety of motivations will inspire people to engage with games and connect with one another. It is blockchain-based tokens that will enable this. By designing viable token economies into our games, we will enable self-sustaining game growth. It is precisely this sort of ecosystem that lies at the heart of what I refer to as “decentralized gaming,” and I hope that this becomes a major trend in gaming going forward. If we refer to the one-way relationship where game players and game providers are linked by games that are finished products as “centralized gaming” to contrast it with decentralized gaming, then incorporating decentralized games into our portfolio in addition to centralized games will be a major strategic theme for us starting in 2022. The basic and elemental technologies to enable blockchain games already exist, and there has been an increase in the societal literacy and acceptance of crypto assets in the past few years. We will keep a close eye on societal shifts in this space while listening to the many groups of users that populate it, and ramp up our efforts to develop a business accordingly, with an eye to potentially issuing our own tokens in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QwMBoq"&gt;It also probably helps that Square Enix doesn’t name any &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; games that might get the blockchain / token treatment, so there aren’t any specific communities of fans ready to come out bearing pitchforks quite yet, unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon NFT announcement&lt;/a&gt; or GSG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59OVKv"&gt;When gigantic gaming companies are faced with the realization that oodles of cash are locked up in the buzzwords “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;,” they’re usually happy to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832490/niantic-ceo-john-hanke-metaverse-pokemon-go-ar-vr-podcast-decoder-interview"&gt;they’ve been-there, done-that&lt;/a&gt;, if they — like Square Enix — have been plugging away at the whole fantasy-meets-reality and / or multiple-world thing for years. Square Enix could have brought up how it already merged &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; with beloved Disney lands via its &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series of games, or how it brought Cloud and Sephiroth and some &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; items, stages, and music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;to Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the very sort of cross-game pollination that metaverse proponents suggest we’ll see a lot more of once we figure out the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jS8cO9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How NFTs are creating a generational divide between platforms  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735719/nft-generational-divide-steam-epic-gaming"},{"title":"How to create an NFT — and why you may not want to","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mxzxP2"&gt;Instead, the company is dipping a philosophical toe in the water, strongly signaling its intent, and — perhaps — waiting to see how its passionate fanbases react to the idea of Square Enix issuing its own tokens, Square Enix designing more economies into its games, and those games becoming somewhat more about money than they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qp6601"&gt;Square Enix is also promising “ample investments in the cloud space,” though it’s not clear if the company is talking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18683382/what-is-cloud-gaming-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-faq-explainer"&gt;cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;. “We are exploring potential efforts in the cloud space from two primary perspectives, the first being leveraging cloud technologies to distribute content and the second being developing content that offers customers new forms of excitement enabled by the cloud’s attributes,” Matsuda writes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsvRLF"&gt;Airbnb announced that it’s changing the way guest profiles are displayed in its app — for Oregon residents specifically. Airbnb hosts who are based in Oregon will now see a potential guest’s initials, rather than their full name, until after they’ve confirmed that guest’s booking request. The change will fully roll out by January 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6AQxz"&gt;The change aims to prevent racial discrimination among hosts, &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-for-guests-who-are-oregon-residents/"&gt;per the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, by stopping them from gleaning a guest’s race from their name. &lt;a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/racial-discrimination-in-the-sharing-economy-evidence-from-a-field-experiment"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that Airbnb guests with names that sounded Black were 16 percent less likely to have bookings confirmed than guests with names that sounded white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQMlsB"&gt;The announcement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/08/airbnb-settles-oregon-discrimination-suit.html"&gt;voluntary settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; that Airbnb reached in 2019 with three Portland-area women who had sued the company. The plaintiffs, all Black, alleged that the platform allowed hosts to discriminate against Black users in requiring guests to attach names and photographs to their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSu5PR"&gt;After settling with the plaintiffs, Airbnb announced that it would “review and update the way profile names are displayed to hosts as part of the booking process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLeeaH"&gt;The company has been vocal about its support for racial justice in the past. It now requires users to agree to an &lt;a href="https://blog.atairbnb.com/the-airbnb-community-commitment/"&gt;Airbnb Community Commitment&lt;/a&gt; certifying that they won’t discriminate. It also launched &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fa-new-way-were-fighting-discrimination-on-airbnb-201&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Project Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to uncover and research discrimination on its platform, in the summer of 2020. Prior to the launch of that program, the company says it did not have a way to measure “larger trends and patterns related to discrimination” across its bookings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfx67i"&gt;Airbnb guests are not required to provide profile photos (though hosts can require them in order to book their properties). Since 2018 (&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/2017/03/oregon_woman_sues_airbnb_says.html"&gt;post-lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, pre-settlement), the platform has also &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fairbnb-answers-guest-profile-photos-77&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kept guest photographs invisible to hosts&lt;/a&gt; before bookings are confirmed. That change, also intended to combat discrimination, has proved somewhat controversial among Airbnb’s users, some of whom worry that it could put marginalized guests in dangerous situations they’d otherwise avoid. “I’d rather get declined for a reservation than beaten or killed!” one user lamented in the company’s &lt;a href="https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Horrible-And-Dangerous-New-Profile-Pic-Policy/td-p/924339"&gt;community center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4jvtz"&gt;But if the company does expect such a strategy to reduce discrimination, why is it limited to Oregon? Reached for comment, Airbnb spokesperson Liz DeBold Fusco did not directly address whether this feature will expand in the future. Fusco pointed to language in Airbnb’s announcement post, which reads, “As part of our ongoing work, we will take any learnings from this process and use them to inform future efforts to fight bias.” The company added that it plans to “continue working with our Hosts and guests, and with civil rights leaders to make our community more inclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
