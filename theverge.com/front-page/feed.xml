    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PqF6OZ"&gt;Amazon’s TV series based on the &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; video games is moving into production this year. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/fallout-series-games-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-geneva-robertson-dworet-graham-wagner-kilter-1234905676/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/fallout-series-amazon-showrunners-jonathan-nolan-1235148546/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that Geneva Robertson-Dworet (&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;) and Graham Wagner (&lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;) will be showrunners on the project; the official &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account retweeted &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;’s story by way of confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU4n5x"&gt;The Prime Video show will be executive-produced by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, creators of &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;. Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard and Bethesda Softworks’ James Altman are also on board as executive producers. Nolan will direct the first episode, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4KJ1Md"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fallout 76 journal: an ongoing exploration of post-apocalyptic West Virginia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104858/fallout-76-bethesda-ps4-xbox-pc-online-multiplayer-journal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5N7ojm"&gt;The show was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21311513/amazon-fallout-tv-show-prime-video-westworld-creators-bethesda"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July. “&lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; is one of the greatest game series of all time,” Joy and Nolan said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; back then. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tQyLp"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; video games are post-apocalyptic RPGs set in a alternate future inspired by ‘50s-era US post-war imagery. Bethesda acquired the rights to the series in 2004 and released &lt;em&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. The most recent mainline game, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;, came out in 2015, while multiplayer spinoff &lt;em&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2018. No upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; titles have been announced, but future games in the series will likely be exclusive to Xbox and PC platforms due to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325757/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-acquisition-game-pass-exclusive-games-phil-spencer-comment"&gt;acquisition of Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro gets a better RAW mode and a wider ultrawide camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsB40f87Eyxw1A4ckKegdYWtmGQ=/0x49:1173x831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357604/OnePlus_10_Pro_Black_Headshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus continues to lean into partner Hasselblad’s image tuning expertise and branding.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sraOKr"&gt;OnePlus is sharing a few more details about the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22849868/oneplus-pro-china-launch-january-11th-design"&gt;OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a focus on camera specifications. If you were hoping for lots of hardware upgrades from this second-gen partnership with Hasselblad, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting — with the exception of a new ultrawide, these updates are primarily software-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKzEpi"&gt;To recap some basic camera specs that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;learned earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus 10 will offer a triple rear camera — likely the same 48-megapixel main, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto configuration as last year. There’s a 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which is a significant resolution bump from the 9 and 9 Pro’s 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzC3Sw"&gt;A notable update is the addition of a shooting mode called RAW Plus which, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW format&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of computational photography and RAW image capture. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offered a traditional RAW mode, so this is a nice improvement for those who want to tinker with data-rich RAW files while retaining the advanced image processing that smartphone cameras are so good at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UNir2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vlrPdg"&gt;All three rear cameras can be used in the updated Hasselblad Pro Mode to control exposure settings and shoot 12-bit RAW files. We really liked the intuitive Pro Mode on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, so we’re eager to check out the latest version. There’s a new manual video recording mode, too, called Movie Mode. It offers control over ISO and shutter speed as well as access to a LOG shooting format that better lends itself to post-capture color grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1EJNZ"&gt;The 9 and 9 Pro cameras featured color tuning by Hasselblad, and OnePlus continues to lean into that aspect of the partnership. In this iteration, it combines its own (also Oppo’s own) “Billion Color Solution” and Hasselblad’s color science to bring 10-bit color to each of the phone’s three rear cameras. That should make for smoother color gradations in images — provided that you’re looking at them on a screen capable of displaying all of those colors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNmthcFuANzn8jtQlWZiFsLFHEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148621/OnePlus_10_Pro_150__Ultra_wide_Portrait_Watermarked.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from OnePlus’ new ultrawide lens is very wide indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek8K6j"&gt;On the hardware side, there’s a new ultrawide camera sensor with an extreme 150-degree field of view — somewhere in the ballpark of 5mm in 35mm terms. If you want to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; go for a dramatic shot, this lens can be used in combination with a new fisheye mode. For a slightly narrower view, the ultrawide offers a 110-degree mode, which is closer to the 14mm equivalent offered by the 9 and 9 Pro, and uses AI distortion correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCzpZB"&gt;There’s one more hardware change to note: it looks like OnePlus dropped the monochrome camera. This was a low-resolution chip that was included in previous models to assist when shooting black-and-white images. That was the claim, anyway. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;struggled to find it making any difference&lt;/a&gt; in monochrome images and my colleague Jon Porter has bemoaned its existence for years, describing it at turns as “baffling” and “pointless.” The renders of the 10 Pro that we’ve seen thus far show three useful-looking cameras along with a flash and nothing that looks like a little monochrome sensor in sight. If that’s the case: farewell, monochrome camera, we hardly knew what ye did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XaGyd"&gt;Outside of camera updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;what we’ve learned about the OnePlus 10 Pro so far&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising at all. It will come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz screen, and 50W wireless charging — in line with previous OnePlus flagships and checking all the “2022 Android flagship” boxes. It’s due to launch on January 11th in China with availability in other regions later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yC6Ti"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Google home speakers are about to get slightly worse because Sonos sued and won</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ce3IEzMFHufCtASw38wt26LyzM8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357551/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-8.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIGmIz"&gt;If you have multiple Google smart speakers in your house, you might want to be aware of a certain legal ruling — because it’s going to affect how your speaker groups work. After the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;ruled that it was infringing on Sonos’ patents&lt;/a&gt;, Google has &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811"&gt;already announced software workarounds&lt;/a&gt; including the “need to adjust each speaker individually instead of using the group volume controller,” and that users will no longer be able to adjust a speaker group’s volume with their phone’s volume rocker. It blames this change on “a recent legal ruling,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;one which you can read all about right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0VBsq"&gt;When news of the patent decision broke, Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it had gotten non-infringing designs approved by the ITC. Sonos warned, however, that Google might have to “degrade or eliminate product features” to be compliant, and that certainly seems to be what’s happening. We just didn’t necessarily expect it to play out this soon, given that Google has 60 days to get its devices into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0N14DB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google copied Sonos’ multi-zone speaker technology, US import regulator rules","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ju2UU7"&gt;The changes seem like pretty big downgrade to Google’s multi-room audio feature that lets &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7174267?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Ccreate-an-audio-group%2Cusing-your-voice"&gt;you synchronize speakers together and have them play all at once&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, instead of being able to say “hey Google, set volume to 40 percent on Living Room speakers,” you’ll have to change the volume for each one, using either the assistant, Google Home app, or a Nest Hub display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlEVrc"&gt;Google also says that “a small set of users” will need to use a specific app to set up their smart devices and update them, and Google is warning users that if their speaker group contains products from other manufacturers, they may need to be updated to the latest firmware to continue functioning as part of that speaker group. Google ends its blog post by saying it will “work to minimize any additional changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon wants to take Sidewalk beyond the neighborhood</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xgD7-Vp0iLmAn-LAW7giIqQ6ZHc=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357531/sidewalk.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Sidewalk network is moving out of neighborhoods and into more public places.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1VevfS"&gt;After going very quiet on its once much-touted connectivity network Sidewalk, Amazon is starting 2022 with a bang. Today it &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-sidewalk-bridge-pro-offers-professional-grade-connectivity"&gt;launched the Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro&lt;/a&gt; powered by Ring (doesn’t that just roll off the tongue?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3CoZS"&gt;This professional-grade bridge is designed to extend the low-bandwidth, long-distance wireless network into public spaces, such as city parks, state parks, city centers, universities, businesses, and other places where there aren’t likely to be a lot of Ring and Echo devices hanging out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA8Dj0"&gt;“The long-term vision of Sidewalk is to drive proliferation of smart and connected things,” Stefano Landi, director of Amazon Sidewalk, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Today, connectivity is the biggest challenge for devices.” Cellular connectivity is too expensive and Wi-Fi and LoRaWAN are limited in coverage, says Landi. “To help the overall ecosystem, an open network like Sidewalk that’s available everywhere was needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O1qdN8Mhio4m3QN_ZYGngDiA7uw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151024/sidewalk_indoor_rgb_2500x2500.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sidewalk Bridge Pro is designed for use by businesses, municipalities and other large organizations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezfg3y"&gt;To promote the benefits of this expansion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; beyond the residential, Amazon partnered with Arizona State University and Thingy to launch pilot programs. The university is using the bridge in its smart cities research, and air quality monitoring device maker Thingy is deploying it to connect its air quality systems in wilderness areas where firefighters battle wildfires.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydMMIs"&gt;“We designed Thingy AQ for very remote locations, where power efficiency and range were critical for fire ground operations, and have been using LoRa since day one,” said Scott Waller, CEO and co-founder of Thingy. “Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro brings us the power of LoRa in a massive number of needed locations, easy integration with our existing applications in Amazon Web Services, and trusted security for the devices and applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="840gkb"&gt;Landi says Sidewalk has gained strong residential coverage in over 100 major metropolitan areas since it was turned on in June 2021. There, its primary purpose is extending connectivity for smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bVxysR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘We believe Sidewalk is the type of network that is going to spur innovation.’ &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ann7lc"&gt;As the smart home steps outside the home, to landscape lighting, outdoor motion sensors, garage door controllers, and pet tracking, these gadgets can struggle to keep a connection to a home’s Wi-Fi. Sidewalk can extend the low-bandwidth working range of these devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rP4mUH"&gt;In homes, most Echo smart speakers and some Ring cameras act as Sidewalk bridges, allowing it to sip a little bit of each device’s bandwidth to power its network (which uses Bluetooth Low Energy, 900 MHz LoRa, and other frequencies). The more of your neighbors with Sidewalk bridges, the stronger the network. Echo device users can choose to enable Sidewalk when they set up their speaker, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463257/amazon-sidewalk-privacy-how-to-opt-out"&gt;turn it on or off at anytime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJgcuL"&gt;The Sidewalk Bridge Pro could extend that neighborhood connectivity further while using fewer devices. It’s a ruggedized, weatherproof device, designed to be deployed by businesses and municipalities and used outside. An ideal spot would be on top of buildings, says Landi. There it can pick up any Sidewalk signal in the same way your smartphone connects to a cellular tower. So, if Fido runs off to the city park to take himself for a walk, you can still find him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHdUkb"&gt;In ideal scenarios, the Sidewalk Bridge Pro has a range as far as five miles, and it needs to be connected over Wi-Fi or Ethernet (PoE) with the option for cellular connectivity. It requires mains power but has a built-in battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNEk08"&gt;“This is year number two of Sidewalk, and it’s going to be a long journey,” says Landi. “But we believe this is exactly the type of network that is going to spur innovation. Our North Star is to connect billions of third-party devices.” Landi sees Sidewalk as a network for developers to build devices on that previously they couldn’t make, due to the cost challenges associated with the current connectivity options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFZMqg"&gt;But if developers are going to build for Sidewalk, it needs to be a robust network, and the Bridge Pro is a step in that direction. Amazon wants businesses and municipalities to partner with it to deploy the bridge. There is no pricing available yet, however, as how exactly it will come to market is still undecided, says Landi. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos wins major patent infringement victory against Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hhA8c6cnH_-fCinZ4SzTLR2Gok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357233/dseifert_190915_3647_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDESWx"&gt;The US International Trade Commission has ruled that Google is in violation of five Sonos patents relating to smart speakers (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623977/sonos-google-patent-lawsuit-itc-judge-initial-ruling-infringement"&gt;affirms a judge’s ruling in August&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the kind of decision that could theoretically force Google to stop importing products using the infringing technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuTMVB"&gt;However, it's not yet clear whether any specific Google products will necessarily disappear from shelves, and for now it seems unlikely that will happen at all. “We do not expect any impact to our ability to import or sell our products,” Google spokesperson José Castaneda tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, pointing to how the International Trade Commission already approved Google workarounds for each of the five patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-redesigns-work-around-sonos-patents-itc-filing-indicates"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; initially reported in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFLkvQ"&gt;We confirmed in the ITC’s order today that it specifically carves out exceptions for five different redesigns to Google’s products — one for each patent — and Castaneda says Google’s customers will not “experience any disruption” as a result of the ITC’s decision, with the company having “60 days to implement changes before a ban goes in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q3iAWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 12 removed, then mostly brought back the ability to control a Chromecast’s volume&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GpFDSe"&gt;One of Google’s workarounds already appears to be live, and more are on the way. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/30/android-12-chromecast-volume-rocker-legal-issue/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported in November&lt;/a&gt; that Android 12 removed the ability to control Chromecast’s volume, with someone believed to be a Google employee citing a “legal issue” as the reason for the feature’s removal. (&lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8588949B2/en"&gt;One of the five infringed patents&lt;/a&gt; is specifically about adjusting volume of devices over a local area network.) But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478797150553362433"&gt;according to Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, the volume control feature has already started to return to some Pixel phones as part of the January 2022 update, and ITC documents show that it approved “redesigns submitted for adjudication by Google” for that specific patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nUgxsw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surprise! Cast volume controls have been re-enabled with the January 2022 update for Pixel. Google either settled its legal matter or this new method enables cast volume controls in a way that doesn't violate the patent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the relevant patch: &lt;a href="https://t.co/trVx0zqhAm"&gt;https://t.co/trVx0zqhAm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEZZy4FXn0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mEZZy4FXn0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478797150553362433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E9WkUF"&gt;Two of the other patents are about synchronizing multiple devices over a network; &lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10439896B2/en"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; is about setting up a playback device (such as a Wi-Fi speaker) for communication over the network to begin with. This evening, Google issued &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811"&gt;a blog post about “Upcoming Speaker Group changes”&lt;/a&gt; which explains that some users will now need to download a special app to set up some devices on their network, and that you’ll no longer be able to adjust the volume of an entire speaker group at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0IJm6"&gt;When we asked Sonos which Google products were affected by the ruling, it sent us a laundry list that included Pixel phones (it used the Pixel 3 and 4 series as examples), home devices like the Nest Hub, Nest Mini, and Chromecast, and Pixel computers like the PixelBook Go with the YouTube Music app installed. The ruling is more broad, saying that “networked speaker devices and devices (for example, mobile phones and laptops) capable of controlling these devices that incorporate the infringing technology” are affected — but only if Google hasn’t already applied the approved workarounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KljkZS"&gt;It’s quite possible that Google will still be able to import and sell all of these devices without pause, even though Sonos suggests that Google’s devices would be worse as a result, writing that Google would have to “degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.” The need to adjust the volume of each of your Google speakers individually does seem like a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrFcBV"&gt;Either way, the ruling finds that Google did copy Sonos technology, and it’s a blow to the image of Google’s hardware business, which has been growing bigger and bigger in the smart home space, including smart speakers, cameras, and prominently in Wi-Fi routers, where the company claimed its Google WiFi / Nest WiFi was the best selling router in the entire market in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQT8EA"&gt;You can read the commission’s full decision below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vsfwac"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21174676-337_1191_notice01062022sgl/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="337_1191_notice01062022sgl (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbAvQa"&gt;Here’s the full statement from Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Glmr8l"&gt;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos’ groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puJ3WL"&gt;It is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done —pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RrKrOh"&gt;Google and Sonos are locked in other legal battles as well — Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288161/google-countersues-sonos-patents-infringement"&gt;filed a countersuit against Sonos&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020, and Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492671/sonos-google-patents-infringement-lawsuit-wireless-audio"&gt;filed another suit&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020 claiming Google infringed on even more of its patents. “We think it’s important to show the depth and breadth of Google’s copying,” Sonos’ Lazarus said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZl1V2"&gt;Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700724/sonos-smart-speakers-concurrency-google"&gt;has also claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Google is preventing it from including multiple voice assistants on its smart speakers, a claim that Google did not deny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sf03BR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 9:04PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information from Sonos about what devices may be affected, with information about Google’s design changes that the ITC says don’t infringe, and Google’s reveal of several changes to speaker groups to avoid import bans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s 2021 pay package swelled to $98.7 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Milwaukee Bucks v Utah Jazz" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVk27OuZxdGisEYmpFktIOrti-A=/1714x23:7183x3669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357468/1235869222.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utah Jazz Owners, Dwyane Wade and Ryan Smith sit with the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook during a preseason game between the against the Utah Jazzv and the against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 13, 2021&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Melissa Majchrzak/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yyHfuA"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312522003583/d222670ddef14a.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed by Apple on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; revealed exactly how much one can earn after ten years of running the world’s most valuable and most profitable company, and for Tim Cook, that number is $98.7 million. While his base salary stayed at $3 million, an additional $12 million in incentives, $82 million worth of stock awards, and the money spent to cover items like security and private flights — since 2017, Apple doesn’t let its CEO fly commercial — nudged the entire thing closer to the $100 million mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Cumulative total Shareholder Return 2011 to 2021" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeGrV_beZJvv-moOEBW-CBI52yM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151140/apple_tsr_cook.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Apple, its total shareholder return “was at the 97th percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;amp;P 500 for the entire performance period” from 2018 to 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uE1d3Y"&gt;That’s more than six times his 2020 pay of $14 million, and as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/06/tim-cook-2021-compensation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and doesn’t include more than $750 million in shares that vested this year as the final part of a ten-year package Cook received when he took over the company. The terms of that package changed in 2013 when stock performance slipped, which Apple says happened at Cook’s request, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4453490/tim-cook-could-lose-half-his-future-stock-compensation-if-apple"&gt;putting some of the grant at risk if didn’t return enough money to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. And as we noted while recapping a decade of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;Apple under the leadership of Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, we all know what happened next. &lt;/p&gt;

It hasn’t all been happy times, however. Over the last couple of years, Apple employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22659497/apple-slack-organizing-zoe-schiffer-decoder-interview"&gt;opened up&lt;/a&gt; like never before about issues with its internal culture including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;push to return to the office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;, among many other things. &lt;/p&gt;

Apple notes in its own document that after putting together “base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2021 as our consistently applied compensation measure” to find the pay of its median employee, they received $68,254, creating a compensation ratio of 1,447 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s Truth Social app will apparently launch in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump Holds Rally At Iowa State Fairgrounds" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Nv2ZOyAfG_yNWumSWlj_LmUWUc=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357397/1345757904.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YrobA2"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s new social network, Truth Social, will launch on iOS on February 21st, according to a listing on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/truth-social/id1586018825"&gt;the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s Presidents Day, if you didn’t know. Subtle.) The app is being made by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), Trump’s new media company led by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821450/devin-nunes-ceo-tmtg-spac-dwac-truth-social-media"&gt;former US Rep. Devin Nunes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oW9aLz"&gt;Truth Social looks very much like a Twitter clone, based on screenshots in the App Store listing. The profile page shown in one screenshot looks almost exactly like Twitter’s, and posts appear to have icons for replies, retweets, faves, and sharing. (Truth Social describes each individual post as a “truth” in the app’s description. The retweet equivalent is apparently called a “re-truth.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SaeeEA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Twitter-like design likely isn’t an accident&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5WJu3"&gt;The social network’s Twitter-like design is almost assuredly no accident. Twitter was Trump’s favorite megaphone for years, until he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned in January 2021&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the January 6th insurrection on the US Capitol. In May, he launched what was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"&gt;essentially a blog&lt;/a&gt; where he posted pithy Twitter-length comments, but it wasn’t nearly as popular as his former Twitter account and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform"&gt;shut down less than a month after it launched&lt;/a&gt;. Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22705584/trump-sues-reinstate-twitter-account-jan-6-riot-protest"&gt;sued Twitter in October&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reinstate his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baLSVH"&gt;It’s unclear if February 21st is also when Truth Social will be available on the web and / or Android. If you visit &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/"&gt;Truth Social’s website right now&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only a button to preorder the free app on the App Store and a form you can fill out to join a waiting list. It’s also unclear whether the social network will be invite-only when it launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwBfd9"&gt;TMTG didn’t immediately respond to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Truth Social has already launched in beta for “invited guests only,” Trump said as part of a December announcement about TMTG’s partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/14/2352123/0/en/Trump-Media-Technology-Group-Announces-Partnership-with-Rumble-Inc.html"&gt;video sharing site Rumble&lt;/a&gt; (which will provide video and streaming technology for Truth Social).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqbvgW"&gt;Truth Social has already hit some controversy, however. Truth Social is built using Mastodon’s source code, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752850/mastodon-trump-truth-social-network-open-source-gab-legal-notice"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon published &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying Truth Social was in violation of Mastodon’s software license because Truth Social claimed it was proprietary and because Truth Social didn’t share its source code back. Mastodon said it sent a formal letter to Truth Social’s chief legal officer asking that it share the source code, and Truth Social has since added an &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/open-source/"&gt;“Open Source” section to its website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter joins Instagram in copying TikTok’s reaction videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4rK_K-SyaMfwqIEa-axN5mGg3lk=/70x0:1690x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356568/FIcfXhPXoAQ3oJp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter’s new “quote tweet with reaction” feature | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="04LXNr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing a feature called “quote tweet with reaction,” where you can embed a copy of a tweet into a photo or video instead of just replying to it with text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H1Ai2"&gt;Twitter says that the feature is currently being tested on iOS. If you have access to the feature, the retweet menu will have a “Quote Tweet with reaction” button. Tapping it will take you to a screen where you can take a photo or video to put the tweet on top of, or choose one from your camera roll. One of Twitter’s product leads did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samhaves/status/1479189730948378630"&gt;a reaction quote tweet to the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which lets us see how the reactions will show up to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTOqmD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. &lt;a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hCGehy4Y7CHtSKglOjeY52BlHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150607/ezgif_3_da208613da.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of creating a reaction to a tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AhYXy7"&gt;The feature is similar to TikTok’s video replies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832529/instagram-reels-visual-replies-feature-tiktok-copy"&gt;Instagram recently copied for its Reels feature&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter itself has also been adding new ways to share tweets — in December 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166657/twitter-share-tweets-snapchat-snap-ios-feature-launch"&gt;added the ability to embed a tweet in a Snapchat message or story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlX0kJ"&gt;Some Twitter users, as well as staff members at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have expressed concern that these reaction quote tweets could be an easy vector for harassment. While it’s relatively easy for the platform to moderate regular quote tweets, it’s harder to programmatically scan the contents of a photo or video. Some of Twitter’s other features include mitigations like being able to opt out of photo tagging, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575998/twitter-tweet-change-who-can-reply-after-you-post"&gt;limiting who can reply to your tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxCV96"&gt;However, Twitter spokesperson Viviana Wiewall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “currently you won’t be able to turn off who can and can’t” use the feature on your tweets, as it inherits the standard quote tweet behavior. When asked if the feature being used for harassment was a concern, they replied: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="drR8JG"&gt;The safety of people on Twitter is our priority and while we don’t anticipate this being used in a harmful fashion, we’ll be closely monitoring the usage of the product and ensure that any abuse is adjudicated as per the Twitter Rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 14 Pro could have a hole-punch camera and hide Face ID under the screen</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7LIn7"&gt;Rumors for Apple’s upcoming 2022 iPhone refresh are continuing to roll, with Twitter leaker DylanDKT claiming that the iPhone 14 Pro lineup will feature a pill-shaped hole-punch design for its front-facing camera, with the bulk of Apple’s Face ID hardware being placed under the display (instead of an eyesore of a notch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5ptVR"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;corroborates earlier rumors&lt;/a&gt; from well-regarded Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from late last year, which also claimed that the 2022 iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max would be shifting over to a hole-punch cutout for the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u4eRCO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am able to corroborate information regarding a hole punch camera for the pro models of the iPhone 14. Face ID hardware will be placed under the display. As a reassurance to any concerns, the functionality of these sensors have not been negatively affected by this change.&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan (@dylandkt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479110144088686604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qSRig"&gt;Apple made its first major change to the iPhone’s Face ID notch with last year’s iPhone 13 lineup, which featured a slightly smaller notch than the original design that Apple had used since 2017’s iPhone X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U0HIa"&gt;And moving the Face ID array beneath the screen while keeping a cutout does make a lot of sense: Face ID’s IR-based setup would be less impacted by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;haziness and weak colors&lt;/a&gt; that exist for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776271/under-display-selfie-cameras-zte-microsoft-xiaomi"&gt;current under-display front-facing cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and reducing the iPhone 14 Pro’s notch to a smaller cutout would put Apple back on even footing with Android competitors, who have long since left Apple’s oversized notch in the dust with years of diminutive camera cutout designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAjn1j"&gt;That said, it seems that Apple might be looking to the slimmed-down notch as a design differentiator between the pricier iPhone 14 Pro lineup and the standard iPhone 14 models, which are said to be keeping the existing Face ID notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ7634"&gt;Additionally, it seems that Apple’s under-display ambitions will still only extend to the Face ID camera array: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;Kuo’s late 2021 report&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Apple’s long-rumored plans to bring back its Touch ID sensor in the form of an under-display fingerprint scanner won’t happen until 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyY5Xg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479164229567537152"&gt;DylanDKT also claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will be released an updated iPhone SE model in 2022, which will keep the same broad design as the current 2020 SE but add 5G and improved specs. Meanwhile, a foldable iPhone is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479157616983130113%5C"&gt;still said&lt;/a&gt; to be in the prototyping phase, with Apple reportedly “playing the long game to see how the technology progresses” before it commits to a consumer device — a claim that’s also in line with Kuo’s earlier reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Natural Cycles’ data shows limited menstrual changes after COVID-19 vaccination</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOoGVG"&gt;Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is associated with only a small change to the menstrual cycle, according to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004695"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; using data from the birth control app Natural Cycles. The study follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374523/covid-vaccine-period-heavy-survey"&gt;widespread reports&lt;/a&gt; of heavier and longer periods from people who had recently been vaccinated after the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PSc5f"&gt;“This is reassuring for health and reproductive health,” says Alison Edelman, a study author and professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University. “It’s also validating in regard to patients reporting that they’d experienced something.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCSEj0"&gt;Longer, heavier periods were always a plausible side effect of COVID-19 vaccination. Any stress on the immune system can affect the menstrual cycle, although that doesn’t mean there’s any impact on fertility. (The vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-vaccines-show-no-signs-of-harming-fertility-or-sexual-function/"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; impact fertility or pregnancy.) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) put out a call last spring for research proposals that could look into the question of impacts on periods. The NIH wanted analysis to happen quickly and asked for studies to be based on data that followed people over time — so it could look at menstrual cycles from both before and after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eXs9K"&gt;Edelman turned to period tracking apps as a source for that data. Her team spoke with both Natural Cycles and Clue, another tracking app. (They’re still analyzing data from Clue, and she says that will likely be included in future studies.) The data these apps provide is “a treasure trove,” Edelman says. People who use the apps can agree to let their anonymized period tracking information be used for research, and Natural Cycles had already been asking users about vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7VtFr"&gt;“This is the best data that we can get for something like this unless they had included the question in the vaccine trials themselves,” Edelman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pWO9Q"&gt;The new Natural Cycles study, which included information on six consecutive menstrual cycles from nearly 4,000 people in the United States, didn’t show major disruptions after COVID-19 vaccination. Overall, there was no change in the length of people’s periods after vaccination. People who were vaccinated had a less than one-day increase in the length of time &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; periods after getting their vaccine compared with the three cycles before vaccination. A small group of people in the study who got both doses of a vaccine within the same cycle were more likely to have a longer increase in their cycle — around two days. The length went back to normal by two cycles later. Anything under an eight-day variation in cycle length is considered normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWhXD1"&gt;The findings are consistent with data from a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266317v1.full.pdf+html"&gt;still-unpublished study&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, which didn’t find major menstrual changes associated with vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWV1Wf"&gt;The team is planning to look at data on the heaviness of people’s periods after vaccination, as well, Edelman says. They’re also planning to look at Natural Cycles’ data from people in other countries. Other research teams funded by NIH are also pressing forward with their studies on menstrual cycles and the COVID-19 vaccine, and that data should be published soon, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evbusi"&gt;But this first set of data helps give doctors and patients solid information on what to expect after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. “We’re now able to tell people really concretely that, okay, just like you might get a headache or you might get a fever, there is a chance that you might have a slight change in your menstrual cycle length,” Edelman says. “And also, that it looks like it’s only temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYvoBJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
