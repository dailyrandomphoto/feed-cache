    <title>Apple’s 20-year head of developer relations retires ahead of Epic App Store trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgylad"&gt;Twenty years ago, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/160968/amp"&gt;poached Ron Okamoto away from Adobe&lt;/a&gt; to become vice president of developer relations and later help build the App Store. Now, we’re learning he has retired — less than a couple months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341511/apple-epic-trial-tim-cook-tim-sweeney-craig-federighi-phil-schiller-mark-rein-testify"&gt;before Apple’s App Store is set to go on trial&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DQmgd"&gt;The eagle-eyed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-s-longtime-app-store-developer-relations-chief-retires?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Mark Gurman at&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; that not only was Okamoto listed as a potential witness in that trial, but that &lt;a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20518642/2021-03-19-apple-tentative-initial-witness-list.pdf"&gt;court documents describe him&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; VP of worldwide developer relations, not the current one. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting that he’s been replaced by Susan Prescott, a product marketing exec who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8744943/apple-wwdc-2015-female-executive-on-stage"&gt;started becoming one of the public faces of the company&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MwApg"&gt;Okamoto’s still set to be deposed in the trial, but perhaps for less than an hour. He’ll seemingly be testifying about the App Store’s policies, business model, how it compares to developing for macOS, and the “transformation of the application software business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D385I6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden to nominate tech antitrust pioneer Lina Khan for FTC commissioner</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Antitrust: Lina Khan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyyViJXGUM_kiQYg9fUe1LkN4T4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007704/824728678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by An Rong Xu for the Washington Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zn42Dr"&gt;President Joe Biden has announced his intent to nominate Lina Khan, a legal scholar and leading voice in the growing tech antitrust movement, to serve as a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiAFgF"&gt;The pick signals that the Biden administration is preparing to take on some of the tech industry’s most powerful and influential companies. In 2017, Khan authored an article for the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;“Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,”&lt;/a&gt; which exploded in popularity in progressive economic policy circles. Khan has also served as an aide to the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust throughout its yearslong investigation into anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PiSuT"&gt;Khan’s nomination follows the appointment of Tim Wu, a Columbia Law professor, to work on technology and competition policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;at the National Economic Council&lt;/a&gt;. Wu coined the term “net neutrality” and has been a prominent voice on the subject of antitrust regulation against Big Tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEvRuh"&gt;Biden’s choice of Khan to serve at the FTC comes as regulators, lawmakers, and the courts are facing immense pressure to take on Big Tech. The House Judiciary kicked off the second leg of its antitrust investigation last month and it’s poised to introduce competition legislation to rein in tech this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8WB7u"&gt;In February, current FTC Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter made remarks suggesting that the agency will take an aggressive approach to tech. Slaughter laid out her enforcement priorities, including competition in markets and algorithmic discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMRc5N"&gt; “[M]any of the largest players in digital markets are as powerful as they are because of the breadth of their access to and control over consumer data,” Slaughter &lt;a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ftc-chairwoman-slaughter-sets-sights-on-5614545/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s first tweet sold as an NFT for an oddly specific $2,915,835.47</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elLf8tnOJhawaIKvcDRIUeQxoPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007597/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21MYhh"&gt;After it spent just over two weeks on the market, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has sold his first tweet as an NFT for the weirdly specific figure of $2,915,835.47. The winning bidder was Sina Estavi, who had held the high bid since offering $2.5 million on March 6th. He upped his bid to this number at the last moment (and if anyone can tell us what that figure represents, we’d love to hear your theories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6Wu25"&gt;Dorsey put the tweet up for digital auction as an NFT — non-fungible token — a digital good that lives on the Ethereum blockchain, on March 5th. Bids were handled &lt;a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20"&gt;on a platform called Valuables by Cent&lt;/a&gt; that lets people make offers on tweets that are “autographed by their original creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rhnEum"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GfAld"&gt;The bids on Dorsey’s succinct first tweet “just setting up my twttr” from March 21st, 2006, quickly escalated, and Dorsey later said he would end the bidding on the tweet’s 15th anniversary. According to the time stamp on Cent, Estavi made his final, winning bid on Monday afternoon, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ?"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; paid using the Ether cryptocurrency in the amount of 1630.5825601 ETH. Estavi, CEO of blockchain company Bridge Oracle, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; he was “thankful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k2MvTN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2006&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vifO3Z"&gt;Dorsey said previously he would convert the winning bid into bitcoin and donate it to GiveDirectly for its Africa Response, and he tweeted his receipt Monday afternoon. GiveDirectly is a &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/about/"&gt;charitable organization&lt;/a&gt; which gives money directly to people living in poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oy7aqx"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzHd09"&gt;Auction winners on Cent get a digital certificate of the tweet with their purchase, which is “unique because it has been signed and verified by the creator.” Dorsey receives 95 percent of the sale price, and Cent gets 5 percent, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iXhertpMT5Y8x-2HmemMtpNB6x9sWPUWJq8s-oacweQ/edit"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; its FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cy1iGL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbtQxl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqjqFI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Justice League to receive an additional black-and-white release on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7RYiQn-WynQBa7MVNK2FbsuKZY=/0x0:1598x1065/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007556/Screen_Shot_2021_03_22_at_10.54.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D1Ocjn"&gt;You may have recently experienced Zack Snyder’s original vision for the Justice League in all its slow-motion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;4:3 aspect ratio&lt;/a&gt; excess, but there’s a missing element to the film that will soon be available on HBO Max: black and white. To hew even closer to Snyder’s ideal version, WarnerMedia is bringing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1373424594787446786?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to its streaming service, featuring the same new cut of the film in an even darker and more grim color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKMZNV"&gt;It was only last week that years of fan organizing culminated in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;the release of the Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no online campaign necessary for this next version of the film. &lt;em&gt;Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt; was announced on the official &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; with no announced release date. A black-and-white clip offers a taste of the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2B6nHp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Zack Snyder's Justice League: Justice is Gray coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnyderCut?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnyderCut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tT4GGngktI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tT4GGngktI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Snyder's Justice League (@snydercut) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1373424594787446786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="khNzEF"&gt;The urge to go black and white might not be a huge surprise. Before the release of the film, several of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1367512643066458112?s=20"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1367886317472808962?s=20"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1368248599453126659?s=20"&gt;posters&lt;/a&gt; shared by Snyder were in black and white. Also, both &lt;a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/justice-league-two-parts-zack-snyder/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashFilm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-release-original-plan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ScreenRant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cite an interview with Snyder on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jLVz95Bwifk"&gt;The Film Junkee YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; where he shared that his ideal version of the film would be black and white and shot for IMAX. &lt;em&gt;Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt; and the decision to release the original version of the cut in the slightly more IMAX-appropriate 4:3 aspect ratio are inching closer to what Snyder always wanted to make. But a better question might be, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0aLoD"&gt;To be frank, the clip above is not a great illustration of the supposed benefits of black and white. For all the dramatic beams of light shining into the Batcave, other parts of the clip are just plain hard to make out. It speaks to the challenge of coloring a film after the fact, especially when it seems like it was conceived for color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCXFLj"&gt;Other popular movies have received post-release conversions to black and white like &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road,&lt;/em&gt; which got a separate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/16/12939122/mad-max-black-and-white-version-dvd-blu-ray"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black and Chrome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; release, and the standalone Wolverine film &lt;em&gt;Logan,&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15652116/logan-noir-screening-hugh-jackman-james-mangold"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logan Noir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The hope generally seems to be that black and white can better highlight cool action moments or communicate some of the moodier, morally gray internal struggles of the characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4DWfi"&gt;Calling this new &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; release “Justice is Gray” speaks to some of that intention. But outside of Snyder’s desire to make a black-and-white film, it feels safe to say this is yet another way to get eyes on HBO Max, whenever it actually gets released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vCYoM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s concert series returns with a Rocket League rave</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0frdLnmWV4o3Nxv51Zm-Ue8Q9Dw=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007270/fortnite_llama_rama_kaskade_concert_1920x1080_27dc77beeff6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F8Sb49"&gt;Epic Games is reviving its in-game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;concert series with a virtual performance by electronic artist Kaskade&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;over the course of the March 26th weekend. The concert will take place inside &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Party Royale game mode, and it will also feature tie-ins with &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming season, as the popular competitive car soccer game is developed by Epic-owned studio Psyonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYnqEe"&gt;There’s a lot of, shall we say, corporate synergy going on here. Psyonix has a longstanding partnership with electronic music label Monstercat to bring leading producers of house, bass, and other genres into &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s in-game soundtrack. And Kaskade just last fall &lt;a href="https://edm.com/lifestyle/rocket-league-season-2-electronic-dance-music"&gt;released his Monstercat debut&lt;/a&gt;, an EP called &lt;em&gt;Reset&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTDEtI"&gt;Now, Kaskade will be performing &lt;em&gt;Reset&lt;/em&gt; in its entirety within &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, while his performance will be followed up by the debut of the &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;season’s new trailer. The producer and DJ will also apparently “drive &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; cars” around to various in-game stages and “arrive at the new Neon Fields for a festival-style performance.” Oh yeah, and the concert can also be viewed with friends from the social video app Houseparty, another of Epic’s acquisitions from the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QBMnx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWPzco67Bmo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yf6CvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s concert series, which started in 2019 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;record-breaking in-game performance by electronic artist Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, became a surprising hit during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to experience the kind of live events that all but disappeared last year. Travis Scott’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;performance last April attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;more than 12 million people&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s Party Royale mode it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;launched around the same time&lt;/a&gt; has become an avenue for all sorts of in-game events and the kinds of cross-cultural spectacles that have transformed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;into a kind of hybrid media destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTlxSV"&gt;Epic has since expanded the technology setup that makes these live events possible with a new studio space in Los Angeles, which it began using for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;three-week concert series in September&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it looks like the developer is ready to get back to hosting boundary-pushing live events with what sounds like a truly transmedia experience covering its many apps, games, and music connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKKiG9"&gt;The Kaskade concert will run inside Party Royale on March 26th at 8PM ET, and then on March 27th at 9AM ET and 2PM ET. It will be part of the next&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/rev-up-for-the-next-llama-rama-earn-rewards-in-fortnite-and-rocket-league"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Llama-rama” event&lt;/a&gt;, where players can earn in-game items and other rewards for playing both &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, starting March 25th and running until April 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2K0pZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep’s ‘Magneto’ electric Wrangler concept is a big tease</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OH2ISekpe7UgQWr0pdSAPc0rpCA=/0x27:3000x2027/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69007068/CN021_004JP5ui31njcmo9dtvpekb1b9b6816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="krRWdH"&gt;Jeep has unveiled a new electric vehicle with an X-Men-inspired name: the Wrangler Magneto. However, don’t get your hopes up for this being the electric Jeep Wrangler you might have been wishing for — the Magneto is just a concept car, so you probably won’t be able to buy one any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCUEXN"&gt;The car’s design is based on the 2020 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, but it has an electric motor that offers up to 273 pound-feet of torque and 285 horsepower, and it comes equipped with an 800-volt system spread across four battery packs, &lt;a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22607&amp;amp;mid=1"&gt;according to Jeep&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t share a range for how far the Magneto can go without needing a charge, though that’s not all too surprising given that this is a concept car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UJf4h8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10406458"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HjXen"&gt;The Magneto also, interestingly, comes equipped with a &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39877/how-the-electric-jeep-wrangler-magneto-concept-works-with-a-manual-transmission"&gt;six-speed manual transmission&lt;/a&gt;. And while that might be surprising, since most electric cars have single-speed transmissions, the Magneto actually isn’t the first electric concept car to have a multi-gear transmission. Ford showed off a concept six-speed manual transmission all-electric Mustang, the Mustang Lithium, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20950148/ford-electric-mustang-manual-prototype-stick-shift-lithium-sema-2019"&gt;back in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AU57So"&gt;Jeep’s parent company Fiat Chrysler (which is now called Stellantis) has been slow to adopt EVs, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC’s Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563949/rivian-electric-truck-suv-price-r1t-r1s-hands-free"&gt;Rivian’s R1T pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; on the very near horizon, Stellantis could risk losing customers if it doesn’t offer an electric version of the Jeep, one of its most iconic cars. And while Stellantis has been making some &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/from-jeep-to-maserati-stellantis-to-rollout-10-new-ev-models-in-2021.html"&gt;bold promises&lt;/a&gt; about its plans for electric vehicles, the Magneto is lacking some substance to show that any sort of electric Wrangler is coming out anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv0p4D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max somehow beats Netflix and Disney Plus to custom profile photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ss46JcwAKZIgOId3LZi20NmqjfI=/104x0:1979x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006956/Screen_Shot_2021_03_22_at_12.43.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUotWp"&gt;I can’t imagine there are many people out there clamoring for the ability to create a custom profile image on their favorite video streaming service, but &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxCustomProfilePhotos03222021&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; wants you to know that it’s giving customers just that option starting today. Subscribers can now choose from a range of preselected avatars — featuring over 120 characters from HBO Max’s library of content — or upload their own photo. The presets come from shows like &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;, and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDxJVi"&gt;Uploading a custom photo isn’t something you can do on Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, or most of the other video streaming apps. (Netflix used to let you link to a social media account and show an image from there, but this is no longer available.) And it could help HBO Max feel just that extra bit personalized to you and other people in your home. If you’ve got kids, maybe they’ll get a kick out of seeing themselves on the profile select screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SSMjM40TZ03HoplmAsOoilXxO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389057/maxavatars.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WarnerMedia&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dHNw04"&gt;“This new feature, which launches today and rolls out across all supported partners by March 26th, allows users to express their identity through a creative lens and further connect with the stories and characters they love on the platform,” WarnerMedia said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcTSUE"&gt;You’ll be able to pick an avatar or take / upload your own photo using the HBO Max mobile or tablet app. That image will then appear across HBO Max on all of your devices. A WarnerMedia spokesperson told me that “uploaded photos are encrypted and hard deleted once a user removes or changes their profile photo.” And if you’ve got parental controls enabled, a PIN is required before the profile image on a kid’s account can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmJts5"&gt;I guess HBO Max gets the win on this one versus its streaming rivals — even if WarnerMedia took its sweet time on other, more important things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21813364/wonder-woman-1984-4k-ultra-hd-dolby-vision-atmos-announced"&gt;like adding 4K support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro: everything we know about the new phones coming on March 23rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEMLXCseYvGioce_ob8iNEHrfYk=/93x0:2097x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006765/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_3.46.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The one place for OnePlus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="T6FYA5"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334396/oneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras"&gt;a week of previews&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and in the press, OnePlus’ new flagship phones are set to be officially announced at an event on March 23rd at 10AM ET. Alongside them, we expect to hear about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g#comments"&gt;a budget option&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339768/oneplus-watch-image-reveal-design-leak-smartwatch-wearable"&gt;new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnZkTx"&gt;OnePlus’ main focus with the 9 and 9 Pro seems to be the cameras, partnering with legendary camera maker Hasselblad for the phones. Whether it’ll help make the cameras excel or be more of a marketing gimmick is something that only testing will reveal, so we’ll post our reviews here when they’re live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWbWp3"&gt;We’ll also post comparisons between the phones and their competitors, along with any other announcements OnePlus may make, so watch this space to see all of our coverage of the event — as well as all of the details OnePlus has already revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit adds Tile tracking feature to its Inspire 2 wearable </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAIez-3ckEW8Peo2rzAzZuAwqBI=/0x79:2700x1879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006741/fitbit_tile.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3uHiY"&gt;A new partnership between Fitbit and Tile will now let users of Fitbit’s Inspire 2 locate their devices with Tile’s Bluetooth tracking, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitbit-inspire-2-devices-now-findable-with-tile-301251281.html"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0qiO4"&gt;The free update is available starting Monday. Users will just have to update their device software in the Fitbit app to add Bluetooth tracking, then download and activate the Tile app. Once the Tile app is enabled, Inspire 2 users should be able to locate their misplaced device (it happens to the best of us) via its most recent location, or they can use Tile’s global crowdsourced network to try to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lZmtY"&gt;Fitbit Inspire 2 users can also sign up for Tile Premium to get smart alerts and other premium content at a price of $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FfRZi"&gt;It’s the first official partnership between Tile and a wearable device company (although Tile does count headphone manufacturers like Bose, Skullcandy, and Sennheiser &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fpartners&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22344359%2Ffitbit-adds-tile-tracking-feature-bluetooth-inspire-2-wearable" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;among its partners&lt;/a&gt;). The lost-item-tracking field is growing crowded as more companies develop products to compete with Tile. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung unveiled its Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have been expected for some time. Both are expected to have both Bluetooth and ultra-wideband (UWB) versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG3i2g"&gt;Also starting Monday, &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-charge-4-updates/"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 4 devices&lt;/a&gt; will get an update that adds SpO2 blood oxygen saturation tracking, skin temperature tracking, and Fitbit’s health metrics dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmPT55"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Cleese has an NFT bridge to sell you for $69.3 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="John Cleese Brooklyn Bridge" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RX2HTeoawTyjcEPr8pHl0q-2dU0=/0x21:653x456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69006735/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;John Cleese’s illustration of the Brooklyn Bridge, being sold as an NFT. | Image: John Cleese&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ah6puc"&gt;“The world has gone terminally insane,” Monty Python’s John Cleese told &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/nfts-are-driving-stunts-and-diving-into-the-culture-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of getting into NFTs. So naturally, the comic actor known for silly walks is now selling a ludicrously expensive NFT of his own: a Vonnegut-esque drawing of the Brooklyn Bridge made on an iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x9201a886740d193e315f1f1b2b193321d6701d07/1021"&gt;It’s listed on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and the auction ends in 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GMfB"&gt;Bidding started at $100 and has now made its way up to nearly $36,000. Cleese won’t let his masterpiece go for that cheap, though. Cleese said he wants $69.3 million for the piece, suggesting the illustration won’t sell unless someone bids at least that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIhFxB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello! It is time you meet my alter ego "Unnamed Artist" I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm selling my 1st NFT. Though bidding starts at 100.00, you can “BUY IT NOW” for 69,346,250.50! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Vuyx4trvPE"&gt;https://t.co/Vuyx4trvPE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aC4oSVfGHF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aC4oSVfGHF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Cleese (@JohnCleese) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/1372944852325789704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OMwB4x"&gt;While many artists are making more money than ever by selling NFTs for their digital goods, Cleese wants to make a joke of it. NFTs, he argues to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, are “another investment vehicle for the uber-rich.” The auction price refers to digital artist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s NFT sale at Christie’s, which fetched $69 million&lt;/a&gt; — the third highest-grossing sale from a living artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="zMmUFh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ydEKw"&gt;Cleese continues by saying “technology is changing and moving so quickly that we can’t even see we’re standing in quicksand as we stare at a bunch of pixelated JPEGs, wondering what they might sell for next.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUfSYX"&gt;Honestly, this sounds like a twisted Monty Python sketch that I want to see actualized. Right before you’re sucked into the sand, surrounded by screens with indiscernible JPEGs, look at the camera and say &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCim90WO1-4"&gt;“It’s!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
