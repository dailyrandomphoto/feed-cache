    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="In8SuQ"&gt;Google gave a glimpse into how the new smart home standard Matter might actually work in our smart homes today, and it’s looking pretty exciting. At its &lt;a href="https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/smarthomesummit2021?utm_campaign=Q3_2021_SHS"&gt;Google Smart Home Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt; today, the company announced new tools to help developers build devices that work with both Google Home, the new connectivity standard Matter, and across any other Matter-complaint ecosystems. This means that, yes — one day, very soon — the (new) Nest Thermostat could work in the Apple Home app without the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678088/home-assistant-amber-smart-home-hub-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; or other workarounds. And if those two can work together, well, anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0fn3"&gt;Due to arrive next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an open smart home application protocol that promises to make smart home devices talk to each other no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made them. It wants to take the hard work out of choosing, setting up, and integrating devices with your smart home and voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDjQVs"&gt;“Matter is a very big initiative for us,” Kevin Po, Senior Product Manager at Google, told me in a briefing ahead of today’s announcements. “It will really solve that interoperability choice, that frustrating purchasing and setup experience for the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/650T2DjqJkUchNh9tZwvw1SEkkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944994/Fg39T_wZn6cXSyiUsE5VWFJcZYp0HgK4Etnqn9wpNloMdq0RMXnAJdYaXtPwMsaRT_OtxaQHJxKLgjjmZrZmZwRbcSM2WSQ1UEZCxIGaSJg5BVD9crA7hFPauYbso0cLOd6xGLMpiVlCAmR63VS7ihfU8L6kPfruCDqytEUqzeb_uH0J_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Smart Home Summit, Google shared images of how device set-up may work with Matter-enabled devices across different apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6fURmm"&gt;At the event, the company doubled down on its commitment to supporting Matter and its main supporting protocol, Thread (a low-powered mesh network), across its entire ecosystem. It also revealed a new name for its smart home efforts: Google Home. While consumers have been familiar with that moniker for a while, on the backend, developers have dealt with a myriad of different services they needed to understand and pick through to figure out how to make their device work with Google Assistant and Google Nest devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khp3sH"&gt;The new Google Home brings development for device setup, automation capabilities, voice control, and Android and Google Nest devices under one umbrella. The new name is “for our entire smart home platform and developer program,” said Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, during the event’s keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8gm7n"&gt;A new Google Home Developer Center was also announced. A one-stop shop for developing anything smart home-related, the Developer Center introduces some new tools to help accelerate the adoption of Matter in the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5M5PU"&gt;A Google Home Device SDK for Matter can help developers quickly build and integrate Matter devices so they’ll be ready when the standard launches in 2022 next year. This is also when Google has committed to updating its Nest and Android devices with Matter support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhxXnI"&gt;Native Android Support via Google Play Services and a new Google Home Mobile SDK will bring Matter support to mobile devices and apps to help streamline smart home device set up. This should mean setting up a Matter-enabled device — such as a light bulb or smart plug — will be as simple as powering it up and opening an app (either Google Home or the manufacturer’s app). The app will then do most of the heavy lifting of connecting to Wi-Fi and Thread, and any other Matter devices you have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6zBWq90eJZkpNmfa-brqk1XLH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944944/9pc16xHlCuF_UeXbhcH2Ln92s8R4glbH6h3f8Fd5MyWI10AQ7ZgpYkWxETyplgBS8GHsFG62THDGT4k5A9SCfTTonAAa3cYA3Bdq52B_7YNZw1Npd_25TId9cfU0COkTIY_K2_Y_kOeIwMzTNK1OhG_bevn22F7ty_cQ5rSpK5LYyl3Z_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Home Developer Center launches next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CC0SOm"&gt;There are a lot of questions still around Matter — but from what Google revealed today, it seems that while a unified setup experience is coming, a unified app is not on the cards. There won’t be a Matter-branded app that you can put all your devices into — instead, you will can choose to use one or more apps from a Matter-enabled ecosystem to control your home with. This is similar to how HomeKit-enabled devices work with Apple’s smart home now — you can use Apple’s Home app or a third-party app to control them. Each app will likely offer different features and controls based on how the manufacturers look to differentiate themselves, so you can choose which suits your needs best. Whether you have to install the manufacturer’s app for firmware updates or other reasons is not clear yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1z0P7"&gt;The most important thing for smart home users is that all Matter-enabled devices will work with all apps that support Matter. So, if Apple opens up its Home app to Matter (and it is on the board of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;CSA&lt;/a&gt;, which oversees the initiative), and Google turns on Matter support in its Nest Thermostat — you will be able to control it in the Apple Home app. “If they are compliant from a Matter of perspective, there’s no reason why that can’t be possible,” confirmed Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtTdgQ"&gt;In other Google Home news, the company announced the introduction of Suggested Routines in the Google Home app. This should go some way to bringing back more of the functionality third-party device makers lost when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627719/google-works-with-nest-shutdown-clarification-statement-update"&gt;Works With Nest program shut down &lt;/a&gt;(some of which returned with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9251759?hl=en"&gt;Home / Away presence sensing option&lt;/a&gt; introduced at this event last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkncNc"&gt;Suggested Routines will let manufacturers build their own Routines (which enable your devices to automatically activate) in the Google Home app to interact with both Nest devices and any other third-party devices you have linked to the app. They’ll be able to use what Google calls “context signals” — voice, time, and device/sensor state — to trigger the Routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgJZi9"&gt;Google is sharing details on its announcements from the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on its blog &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__developers.googoe.com_home&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=GEaaI7fN8ZswBqQsRUaUCu28wSH030uUeFD1YjD3z-w&amp;amp;s=kobZ__5jP0b5Pb9WrKoYG_lydZXKG1XsN5anF3L3bus&amp;amp;e="&gt;developers.google.com/home&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the new tools are available in preview now and rolling out next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Xbox Game Pass on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oP_p487HW5Tm7nzfYP9UXAW_d0I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026536/Among_Us_Hero_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsivCO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is arriving on Xbox and PlayStation on December 14th. The popular social deduction game will &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/among-us-launching-with-xbox-game-pass-on-december-14/"&gt;also launch on Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; on the same day and be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PS4, and PS5 consoles. The announcement comes months after Sony confirmed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;coming to its PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaCuk"&gt;Just like on other platforms, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; will support crossplay and online multiplayer across mobile, PC, and now consoles. The only difference between the two console versions is PlayStation players will get access to exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics. There’s a skin and hat to make your character look like Ratchet, and a pet that looks like Clank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKlpAs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit during the early stages of the pandemic, becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;. Innersloth has been gradually improving the game over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526162/among-us-innersloth-new-modes-map-hide-and-seek-summer-game-fest-2021"&gt;revealing plans to add&lt;/a&gt; a hide and seek mode, visor cosmetics, and a fifth map earlier this year. Physical editions of the game are &lt;a href="https://www.innersloth.com/xbox-playstation-launch-on-dec-14/?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;amp;utm_campaign=console"&gt;also arriving in Europe&lt;/a&gt; on December 14th, with a US release due in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators demand more info about tech payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A closeup photograph of an Indian man in a blue business suit, his collar just barely visible." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nbuFJSPfh4dFr0Y16Bx3iLapxDU=/0x0:4951x3301/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026521/1176565198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CFBP Director Rohit Chopra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mx18fp"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a series of information-gathering orders on the business practices of major digital payments systems. Orders were issued to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, and Square, the bureau said in an announcement on Thursday morning. Chinese pay systems operated by WeChat and AliPay will also be studied but are not subject to any CFBP orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofUkWp"&gt;Issued as part of the CFPB’s investigative authority, the orders are not an indication of specific wrongdoing, but they suggest the CFBP will be taking a more active role in regulating tech companies’ consumer products in the future. In particular, they are meant to root out any data collection or anti-competitive conduct that may have not yet come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1J1or"&gt;The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ce2B1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Will the payment platforms be truly neutral?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c89uVx"&gt;In a statement, CFBP Director Rohit Chopra framed the orders as an effort to ensure tech companies were not using the power of payment processing to exploit consumers or gain an anti-competitive advantage over smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBI2sR"&gt;“Little is known publicly about how Big Tech companies will exploit their payments platforms,” Chopra said in a statement announcing the queries. “For example, will the operators engage in invasive financial surveillance and combine the data they collect on consumers with their geolocation and browsing data?... Will the payment platforms be truly neutral, or will they use their scale to extract rents from market participants?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMPpDf"&gt;Previously an FTC commissioner, Chopra worked closely with current FTC Chair Lina Khan, and the new investigation is meant to harmonize with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;the FTC’s ongoing tech antitrust efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwtBNl"&gt;The orders are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates, including the American Economic Liberties project. “The CFPB’s orders will force Big Tech to come clean on their surveillance, data collection, and payments systems,” the group said in a statement, “and provide regulators another important window in their sprawling empires.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will make it easier to separate your work and personal life on Android </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQOaz-2RhlEiAcYAhYOncCmPSjg=/78x0:1362x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026346/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_2.25.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vWQON"&gt;Google’s Work Profile tool for Android, which lets you hide your work apps and data with the flip of a switch and keeps your personal phone use safe from your company, will be coming to more users next year. According to a blog post from the company, currently, the feature is limited to phones that your organization manages, but Google says it’ll start to become available to people using Google Workspace in 2022. After that, it’ll branch out with the ultimate goal of letting anyone using Android for work flip a switch to make their business apps disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfnme"&gt;The ability to turn off work, especially when many of us are working remotely, is sorely needed. My colleague Monica Chin recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;wrote a great argument&lt;/a&gt; for why you should have a personal laptop and a work laptop that you can close at the end of the day (and that doesn’t expose your business to your company). It’s nice to see Google making its software equivalent of that available to more people because while having two phones really cements the work / life walls, it’s just not practical for most (and could honestly be a bit of a headache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ECdmo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqwoXmaxs3M?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=69&amp;amp;start=69" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbXXIX"&gt;Google also says that it’s working with identity and single sign-on providers Ping, Okta (choice of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s IT department), and Forgerock to improve security when users access their company’s content. The company wants to have users authenticate in its Custom Tabs system, rather than a WebView, making &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/"&gt;the experience faster for employees&lt;/a&gt; and allowing providers like Okta to access more of the phone’s security information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nzgoQ"&gt;Google’s focus on security, which includes pushing the Android Management API that comes with &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/"&gt;Android’s recommended requirements&lt;/a&gt; set by default and lets enterprises get new features quickly, isn’t just talk, either. It’s also launched a bug bounty specifically for Android Enterprise, which will pay up to $250,000 if you’re able to find a major vulnerability on Pixel devices running Google’s business-focused software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaIbS"&gt;The focus on security, combined with the other improvements we’ve covered, makes it seem like Google’s focusing on making Android more suitable for the future where many of us work remotely — an especially relevant focus for the company, which is planning on (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt;) implementing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;a hybrid work system for its own employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google lowers Play Store fees for subscriptions and music streaming apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eHIgJEzxbCPY3isq0hfR3ZY7Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026351/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sGWkFg"&gt;As regulatory pressure on the Play Store for Android increases, Google is once again making changes to its business structure. It has announced that more categories of apps will be eligible to pay significantly less than the usual 30 percent fee. The company is announcing that all subscription-based apps will now pay a fee of 15 percent. It’s also says that “ebooks and on-demand music streaming services” will be “eligible” for a fee “as low as 10%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rhMj"&gt;Google’s stated reason for the cheaper prices on ebooks and music streaming apps is that “content costs account for the majority of sales” and that the rates “recognize industry economics of media content verticals.” It’s unstated but also surely true that regulatory pressure and public pressure from companies like Spotify have factored in to Google’s decision. Currently, signing up for a Spotify subscription on Android redirects you to Spotify’s website to enter your payment information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbMLST"&gt;The lower fee structure for music streaming is still at Google’s discretion, both for which apps are eligible and how low that fee will be. When asked how exactly developers can know if they qualify for the reduced fees, a Google spokesperson said, “Developers can review program guidelines and express interest now and we’ll follow up with more information if they are eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re4Ccw"&gt;As for subscriptions, Google’s previous structure was similar to Apple’s: 30 percent the first year, 15 percent thereafter. The new change simplifies that by offering 15 percent right off the bat and is likely a strong incentive for developers to switch over from one-time payments to subscriptions. Google says that one reason for the change is that “we’ve heard that customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit from that reduced rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEvhp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is feeling the regulatory heat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Osen9"&gt;Google already has a program wherein the first million dollars a developer earns through Google require a 15 percent cut, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;instituted in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And since so many apps are ad-based and therefore free, the company claims that 99 percent of developers “qualify for a service fee of 15% or less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlI13M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;South Korea recently ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Google must allow third party payments in its Google Play ecosystem and Google has said that it would comply. In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Sundar Pichai spoke to the importance of Google Play revenue to the overall Android business model for Google (emphasis ours below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NPH6Eb"&gt;We don’t take a share of the device sales, not a share of the carrier revenues. So in some way we have to sustain our ecosystem. We have a different model. Google Play is an important way. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, it’s the main source of revenue&lt;/strong&gt;. It supports Android as a whole. I think we’ll make that viewpoint clear, but we’ll engage in conversations. I’ll leave it to the team to figure out the right next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBiUXV"&gt;One big source of revenue is in-app payments for games. On that front, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google is in a legal battle with Epic Games over &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is not available in the Google Play store (but can be side-loaded through a relatively onerous process). Google is also facing a lawsuit filed by a coalition of 36 state attorneys general over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;antitrust concerns with the Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAXwR7"&gt;Add it all up and it’s obvious that Google is doing what it can to set up release valves for all that pressure by reducing store fees where it feels it can. Google lined up positive quotes from both Bumble and Duolingo in support of its lower subscription fees, a message surely aimed at regulators. And the company is likely to continue to bring out developers who aren’t angry at the Play Store business model at its &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit"&gt;developer summit next week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxgBDa"&gt;We asked Google to comment if these changes were in response to regulatory pressure, and a spokesperson replied, “Google has a long history of evolving Android and Play’s model based on feedback from our developer ecosystem on what they need to be successful on Play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxAYiz"&gt;Still, it isn’t going to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back to the Play Store (since it won’t qualify) and it’s far from clear that the lower fees are going to appease regulators anywhere. The pressure on Google and Apple to lower their app store fees is already having an effect. Despite these changes, it still seems that the pressure will lead to actual legal action — either via the courts or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bought a messaging app to help make DMs and Communities better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxBNWeejnJIBBxJQpW4WgRw9Au4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026299/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Ssgqa"&gt;In an effort to strengthen its Communities, Twitter has acquired Sphere, a group chat app founded in 2016 that aims to make conversations more interactive and organized. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but &lt;a href="https://www.sphere.me/"&gt;Sphere’s website&lt;/a&gt; describes the app as a place that “transforms groups into vibrant communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XsP8Y"&gt;Sphere was co-founded in 2016 by &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-daloisio"&gt;Nick D’Aloisio, a British computer programmer turned serial entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, it was an app for real-time questions and answers but later evolved into a hub for group chats (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/twitter-buys-nick-daloisios-free-chat-app-sphere-.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). During Sphere’s standalone existence, it aimed to bring organization to group conversations on mobile. As shown on Sphere’s website, some of its features included self-clearing feeds, auto-archiving, and call-outs for important messages. It also let users hold interactive conversations categorized by specific interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmM0Of"&gt;The Sphere acquisition marks the second startup that D’Aloisio has sold; in 2013, when he was 17, D’Aloisio sold his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/1/3583720/summly-nick-d-aloisio"&gt;news summarizer startup Summly&lt;/a&gt; to Yahoo for $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdlwSR"&gt;All employees on Sphere’s small 20-member team will be joining Twitter, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467"&gt;Sphere’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Nick Caldwell, Twitter’s vice president of engineering, tweeted that Sphere will be helping Twitter tackle Communities, DMS, and Creators roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dtB4NB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Sphere team’s expertise and leadership’s passion for finding ways to help people connect will help accelerate our Communities, DM, and Creators roadmaps.  &lt;/p&gt;— Nick Caldwell   ‍ ⚡️ (@nickcald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1450854466127683588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5x45jA"&gt;It’ll be especially interesting to see Sphere’s impact on Twitter’s invitation-only Communities, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;the feature it launched in September to compete with Facebook Groups&lt;/a&gt;. Communities let users join spaces for specific interests, such as for sneaker collectors or for skincare lovers. Although Communities are invite-only for now, Sphere may be able to help speed up the process and make the feature become available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpm30M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Critics and supporters come out in force to discuss SpaceX’s plans to launch from South Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bgdRM0Q5BFsaT_lN1mrTOYRA7oo=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026268/51370391111_a43a3825e5_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX stacking its Starship spacecraft on top of a Super Heavy booster at the company’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLINNc"&gt;This week, a vibrant mixture of supporters and critics voiced their opinions about SpaceX’s launch operations in Boca Chica, Texas during virtual town halls — input that will be considered as the government decides the company’s future in the state. More than one hundred people took the time to give their thoughts during the meetings on Monday and Wednesday, with opinions ranging from effusive praise of the company to concerns over SpaceX’s impact on the region’s communities and environment. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcxSBL"&gt;The lengthy town halls were &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/"&gt;hosted by the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently evaluating whether to give SpaceX a license to launch the company’s massive new Starship rocket out of Boca Chica. SpaceX has been building and testing Starship prototypes at its launch facility in Boca Chica for the last four years now, but the company wants permission to launch the vehicle into orbit from the area. Such operations require a license from the FAA in order to ensure that orbital launches won’t harm nearby people or property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT1hD5"&gt;As part of the licensing process, the FAA conducted an environmental review to assess what kind of effects SpaceX’s launches will have on the area. The agency released its findings in what is known as a &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/media/Draft_PEA_for_SpaceX_Starship_Super_Heavy_at_Boca_Chica.pdf"&gt;Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, or PEA, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/faa-releases-draft-environmental-report-on-spacex-starship-orbital-launches/"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. That release sparked the beginning of a comment period that has been extended until November 1st, where members of the public can give their thoughts on the PEA and bring up any possible issues the FAA might have missed. While the FAA accepts comments in writing, the agency also hosted the town halls this week so that people could give their opinions orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X6ATs4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would just like to say that SpaceX is doing an amazing job in Texas.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgc5Ue"&gt;SpaceX fans attended the meetings to show their support for the company’s efforts. A common theme among the supporters was that while they did not live in Texas or near Boca Chica, they wished to see SpaceX continue working and launching from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCfgap"&gt;“I don’t live near Texas, I have no stake in this currently,” one commenter said. “But I would just like to say that SpaceX is doing an amazing job in Texas, and that I would like to see this process move a bit faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3qdBrLK4bqzQ5alJLdfCAEoN0_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944727/FCA6oFSWUAEWC5Q.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rendering of the proposed launch site provided during the FAA meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LlLBwD"&gt;“I’m a Georgia resident not representing any organization or special interest group,” another commenter said. “I’m speaking on behalf of my personal capacity as an enthusiastic supporter of SpaceX and a supporter of the human enterprise to push mankind’s boundary beyond Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoUjWO"&gt;Some fans of the company argued that SpaceX is bringing jobs and economic growth to Brownsville, the city next to Boca Chica, but most talked about being inspired by the company and their belief&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that Starship work must continue so that humanity can become a “multi-planet species” — a common term used by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. SpaceX’s Starship system has yet to carry passengers or reach orbit, but the company hopes to fly people on the vehicle to Mars someday. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;SpaceX also holds a contract with NASA&lt;/a&gt; to develop Starship as a lunar lander that can take astronauts to the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oajSE6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re not considering us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VvjyQE"&gt;Some who identified as residents in the area also expressed support. “I love you, SpaceX and I love you, Elon Musk, too,” one person who recently moved to the area said during her statement. Another woman living in the area noted that she “slowly but surely have watched a rocket rise from the dunes of the beach and it’s been an honor and a privilege to be able to see something magical created out of this world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbDnny"&gt;However, plenty of nearby residents were adamantly opposed to SpaceX’s plans. Common complaints revolved around access to the nearby beach. Roads are frequently closed in Boca Chica to accommodate major testing and test launches. “They’re not considering us,” a resident said. “My personal experience having to want to go to the beach and the road is always closed, where they have promised that we will not be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7SzpX"&gt;Others denounced the debris that has fallen on the ground during major test failures. One test launch in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;ended in an explosion that sprayed chunks of metal and rocket parts&lt;/a&gt; across the terrain surrounding the Boca Chica launch site. Apart from that, noise and rumblings from successful launch tests were also a big point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gan6fm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know how you can say that the noise is in any way acceptable.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eEROSb"&gt;“With these smaller rockets, I don’t know how you can say that the noise is in any way acceptable or that the vibrations are in any way acceptable,” one resident argued. “My house shakes with little rockets, and it sounds like the rocket is coming right over my head. And when they lose these heavy rockets, you’re already seeing cracks and certain seismic issues having to do in South Padre Island.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HizDf3"&gt;Supporters had their own interpretations of the intense noise. “Regarding the sonic booms and the noises caused by SpaceX operations, they should be met with a consideration that the shaking of your chest is a positive thing, as SpaceX’s operations not only inspire hope in so many across this nation and the world [but are] propelling humanity on a course of togetherness and prosperity,” one supporter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGPIuw"&gt;Critics representing environmental groups joined the calls to express concerns about SpaceX construction and operations harming the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surrounding wetlands and endangered species, including birds called plovers that nest&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the area. Others also worried about the vague nature of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SpaceX’s plans to build a natural gas plant in the area to provide methane for the rockets; without details, they say the impacts of a plant are difficult to assess. In response, supporters argued that Cape Canaveral, Florida — home of the US’s busiest spaceport — also operates near a wildlife preserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7rhRO"&gt;A lot of critics demanded that the FAA conduct a second environmental impact statement, or EIS, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/environmental/nepa_docs/spacex_texas_eis/"&gt;which the agency already did for SpaceX’s Boca Chica site in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. However, the FAA conducted that review when SpaceX originally planned to fly its smaller Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from the area, with up to 12 planned commercial launches a year. Starship is substantially bigger than SpaceX’s other rockets and still has years of development ahead. The FAA says the company plans to fly Starship up to 20 times a year during flight tests in the early years of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yY44Kq"&gt;The FAA says it will weigh all comments equally, including the ones submitted in writing. After evaluating all of the feedback, the FAA will respond and incorporate them before publishing a final PEA sometime after the comment period closes on November 1st. The agency could release a “finding of no significant impact,” or FONSI, for SpaceX’s launch site, before continuing on with the launch licensing process. Or the FAA could decide to conduct another EIS, a choice that would certainly prolong SpaceX’s plans to conduct an orbital launch from Boca Chica as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NySyv3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eBfvQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCxPGT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you prefer compact, you can pick between black or white versions of Razer’s Huntsman Mini 60-percent boards with clicky optical switches for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOazpadJ7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$95 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$94 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. A small-format keyboard might be intimidating at first, with its omission of a number pad and F-keys, but it allows you to keep your hands closer together for a more ergonomic feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjT5n2"&gt;If a full-size board is more in your comfort zone, the larger BlackWidow V3 with Razer’s clicky green switches for that tactile and audible response is $100 — saving you $40 at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOjJq4uaA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08FQPLCNC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiXzcI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="g5JFHe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819458"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7fsLi"&gt;Other notable Razer deals to consider today are its top-tier &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOqPZrvBi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kiyo Pro webcam for $155&lt;/a&gt;, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate wireless mouse for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B08564NLZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$90 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the more modest entry-level Basilisk X wireless mouse for just $35 at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOAdW3WZ7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Gaming/dp/B07YPBQSCK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Seiren Mini condenser microphone for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPODf4PLOE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is a very compact microphone that can be a gateway for getting started with streaming, pairing nicely with the Kiyo Pro for a one-two punch of audio and video. If you opt for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPOEhcFa4I" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink version of the Seiren Mini at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s just $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19GKyw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730624"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Xs1mtM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10392735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="887QVN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lK00Wm"&gt;This massive 70-inch 4K Smart TV from Samsung is currently enjoying a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPsT1iGcFW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 discount at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This voice-assistant enabled Smart TV is currently available for its lowest price ever, making it an excellent value for anyone looking for a larger-than-average HDR panel. The Tizen smart platform is compatible with most major streaming services, but this model does have a built-in USB port if you want to expand your channel selection with a Roku or other peripheral streaming device. This model features two HDMI inputs but doesn’t have any component inputs, however, this omission likely won’t affect you unless you’re using devices that are more than 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2t7kni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTuYU0"&gt;The HP 15 laptop is an excellent option for anyone who needs a sensible, budget-friendly laptop. Best Buy is currently offering this model for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPsX3hjULG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400, the lowest price we’ve ever seen&lt;/a&gt; for this particular model. Its specs aren’t going to blow anyone out of the water, but it’s more than up to the task if you need to take work away from your desk. The HP 15 features a 15-inch 1080p screen powered by Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzJavs"&gt;A pair of USB-A ports for peripherals is backed up by an SDXC card slot, an HDMI output, and a single USB-C port. Just take note that the USB-C port is not Thunderbolt 4 compatible, however, so it won’t work with a Thunderbolt dock if you need the extra connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FCXEjP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818010"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RjQCP"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 7i 14 ultraportable touchscreen laptop is a great thin and light 2-in-1 for everyday computing needs or getting work done while traveling. Best Buy is currently offering it for $200 off until October 23rd, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPs1ilvrxd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bringing the price down to just $750&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a great value for a laptop which is ready for commuting and fully compatible with a free Windows 11 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="40TglV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818016"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bIwNh"&gt;If your home is struggling with your current wireless setup, you might benefit from an upgrade. Currently, at Best Buy you can grab this Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi 6 router for half off, bringing it down to just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPs7Uo6AxV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150, its lowest price ever&lt;/a&gt;. Like most people, you’re probably spending top dollar on your ISP’s internet connection, but if you feel your download speeds are still having a hard time, you could probably benefit from a better router. The AX5200 offers transfer speeds up to 5,200MB/s over Wi-Fi and managing your security settings is made easy through the Nighthawk app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UU0Td3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10818030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mvCJBp"&gt;Some deals to revisit or reconsider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TbkN7T"&gt;We just featured the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 in yesterday’s roundup, but now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeGalaxyBuds2102121/https://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot also has them for even cheaper at just $100&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new all-time low for the noise-canceling wireless earbuds from Samsung, though note that this new offer comes with a 90-day warranty direct from Woot. If you prefer the full one-year warranty, the deal for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is still going. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bSJTaD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc0kVO"&gt;A similar deal across Amazon and Woot can be had on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Woot has an international model with its own 90-day warranty &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeGalaxyBudsPro102121/https://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-anc-wireless-earbuds-international-model-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for only $115&lt;/a&gt;, while Amazon has the USA model, complete with a one-year warranty from Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $150&lt;/a&gt;. This is another nice choice of ANC earbuds if you prefer to have its IPX7 water and sweat resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I6OYiT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSP8Ge"&gt;Lastly, the Sony WH-1000XM4 Bluetooth headphones are still on sale for the limited-time pricing of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$248 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know how much longer this deal will stick around, but there’s a reason it has been one of our favorite over-ear wireless headphones. These headphones are comfy to wear and they offer great sound quality with active noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ROXXPk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple still won’t mandate vaccines but will require employees to regularly take COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQrzhAXr3SfckiQIdgUZ7X-X4Gk=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026134/B2E53F34_14F4_4895_AECA_E72D86070E7C.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcpkIi"&gt;Apple is tightening its COVID-19 policies, requiring that unvaccinated employees (or employees who refuse to disclose their vaccination status) get daily COVID-19 tests to enter its offices, although the company still has yet to require workers to get vaccinated. Vaccinated employees will also have to do regular tests, but only once a week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAC851"&gt;Retail workers at Apple Stores will also have to regularly test, although at a lower rate than other Apple employees: unvaccinated store workers will have to take tests twice per week, with vaccinated workers getting tested once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ant7NO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all require in-person employees to be vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9uVSGn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has asked its employees to submit proof of vaccination by October 24th, ahead of the new testing requirements kicking in on November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T634xv"&gt;And while the move does mark a slightly stronger push by Apple to get its employees vaccinated, it still falls short of actually requiring employees to get vaccinated. Apple is one of the largest major tech companies that hasn’t instituted a mandate yet, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; all requiring that in-person employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter their offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DInOFI"&gt;Apple’s new requirements also after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;President Joe Biden’s announcement of plans&lt;/a&gt; to establish new OSHA standards that would require companies with more than 100 employees (which Apple certainly falls under) to ensure employees either are vaccinated against COVID-19 or conducting weekly testing, something Apple’s new requirements would meet. &lt;/p&gt;
