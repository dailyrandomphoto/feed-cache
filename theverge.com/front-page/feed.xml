    <title>Netflix is adding the original Cowboy Bebop so you can watch it all before the live action adaptation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_tyR55YNTZj4p2dNrHVzrlso6U=/28x0:1051x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986898/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_4.20.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from &lt;/em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEggb0"&gt;Netflix is adding the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787"&gt;original &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; anime series&lt;/a&gt; to its catalog on October 21st, giving you about a month to watch it all ahead of the live-action series’ debut on November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHihKP"&gt;This is great news for me personally. I’ve been extremely intrigued by what Netflix has shown from the live-action series — which so far has included a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;series of images&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2N-9EmedA"&gt;opening title sequence&lt;/a&gt;, which is inspired heavily &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Go4J1RaeuM"&gt;by the one from the anime&lt;/a&gt; —  but I haven’t seen the original show for myself. Now that the whole show will be on Netflix, I can see it all with a subscription to just one streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="frpIUS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bang… COWBOY BEBOP, the original anime series, is coming to Netflix worldwide on October 21 &lt;a href="https://t.co/BN3LF2XVSl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BN3LF2XVSl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TONzqb"&gt;It’s unclear if the move to Netflix means that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; will be removed from Hulu, Funimation, or any of the other streaming platforms &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/cowboy-bebop-2001"&gt;where it’s currently available&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also unclear based only on Netflix’s tweet if the show will be updated or remastered in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix calls Squid Game its ‘biggest ever series at launch’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6RxfL3Ai631T6YxSzglRKURO8c=/382x206:2463x1593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986799/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.32.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9tbPJY"&gt;Netflix’s hugely popular series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713623/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-prank-calls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has become its biggest title ever at launch, the company said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVXbpl"&gt;The company’s Netflix Geeked account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1448045572200534022?s=21"&gt;tweeted Monday&lt;/a&gt; that Hwang Dong-Hyuk’s survival thriller reached 111 million global accounts in its first 17 days on the service. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is the first Netflix series to surpass 100 million in its first 28 days on the service, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Netflix typically uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;28-day windows&lt;/a&gt; to measure the performance of a title on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUF326"&gt;The spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the figures it shared are based on the number of accounts that watched the series for at least two minutes, its standard metric for ranking titles (though it has used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924954/netflix-viewers-numbers-metrics-data-stranger-things-tuca-bertie-oa-renew-cancel"&gt;additional measurements&lt;/a&gt; to track the success of titles in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uXyywR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It took more than 10 years for Hwang Dong-hyuk to get Squid Game made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only took 17 days and 111M global fans to become our biggest ever series at launch (and the first to surpass 100M when it premiered). &lt;a href="https://t.co/zVF8GjHIkQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zVF8GjHIkQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448045572200534022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u3h58G"&gt;Since debuting on Netflix on September 17th, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has reached the no. 1 position on the streaming service in 94 countries — every country in the world where the service features a top 10 list, the company spokesperson said. Additionally, the show has held the no. 1 position for 21 days in the US, shattering the record for a non-English language title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukWTCy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713623/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-prank-calls"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; as the first Korean title to reach the top spot in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s new headset has leaked and it’ll make you look like a bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5EM-O7gb3oItoEIJlCr7-eA9uU=/36x0:1656x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986793/FBiCo_yWUAAAbAd.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked marketing image of the unannounced HTC Vive Flow VR headset.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9ulGQ"&gt;On Monday, I wrote about leaked details of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721337/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse"&gt;unannounced HTC Vive Flow VR headset&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be announced at an event on Thursday. Just one day later, we now know what it looks like thanks to images shared by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412"&gt;prolific leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, who has been actively posting new photos over the course of the evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Afp9"&gt;Here’s the first batch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xZyEq6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Miss me, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HTC&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://t.co/hB7iPLLCHk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hB7iPLLCHk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTH5Cu"&gt;Overall, the images in Blass’ first tweet match many of the details &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/htc-flow-hue-viveport-verse"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, but they give a much better idea of what the final device may look like. (And I’m just going to say it: the leaked promo kind of makes the wearers look like bugs.) It’s hard to tell if the big yellowish spots on the front of the headset are see-through; but if you look closely, it appears there may be cameras embedded in the front of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BP0yKr"&gt;The first leaked photos appear to indicate that the headset will be tethered via a wire to some kind of tube-shaped device, which will perhaps provide a little extra power to the headset (similar to the original Magic Leap). Another set of images leaked by Blass shows that it does have internal processing (and a blower-style cooling fan) too, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PzhMNU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/lnFaZLvNCR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lnFaZLvNCR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448058074896519168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nup2Hy"&gt;Conspicuously, there doesn’t appear to be a head strap in these images of the Vive Flow. Most headsets that people find comfortable balance their weight using some kind of strap, so we’ll have to try the Vive Pro for ourselves to see if HTC has figured out a way to make Vive Pro pleasant to wear without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tfzjT"&gt;The new headset also has an extremely close resemblance to HTC’s “Project Proton,” a prototype mixed reality device the company revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145260/htc-project-proton-vr-ar-xr-headset-prototype-cosmos-vive-5g"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt; with a similarly buggy-eyed design and a similar possibility of being tethered to a pack. It’s unclear if the Vive Flow is the final retail evolution of that Proton, but it seems like a strong possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Proton prototype headset design" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQyqIaqnxljCCfbIVJFMQpEEhvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19733660/Proton_glass_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HTC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One iteration of HTC’s “Project Proton” prototype, from February 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="osDIwN"&gt;If you want to learn more about the Vive Flow, you might not have long to wait, as the company will be hosting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Fgo-with-the-flow%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723442%2Fhtc-vive-pro-headset-leaked-photos-evan-blass-bug-look" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an event on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with the coincidental tagline “Go with the Flow.” Earlier Tuesday morning, HTC teased a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htcvive/status/1447944104609042432"&gt;very brief look&lt;/a&gt; at what will be announced there — while it’s hard to tell if it matches the leaked renders from Blass, it sure does look like a VR headset of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OigmpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good things come to those who VIVE. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoWiththeFlow?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoWiththeFlow&lt;/a&gt; on October 14.

    <title>Coinbase is adding a way to showcase NFTs later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNSQn3lpdKtcPuwGdf3b_FFvnDI=/25x0:675x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986646/0_fwgVMwxTtDBDuIue.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Coinbase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KU8SrC"&gt;Coinbase &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72"&gt;announced Monday that it plans to sell, trade, and mint NFTs&lt;/a&gt; in an expansion from the marketplace’s cryptocurrency-based roots. Details on how “Coinbase NFT” will do all of that are slim, but the company sees an opportunity. “Just as Coinbase helped millions of people access bitcoin for the first time in an easy and trusted way — we want to do the same for the NFTs,” Coinbase vice president of product Sanchan Saxena writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KetjVa"&gt;The big idea seems to be social engagement. Coinbase wants to “curate your personal feed” of NFTs and display the NFTs you own on your profile so you can make connections with like-minded fans of digital cats, punks, apes, and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rxPwu8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="llBuHk"&gt;At launch, Coinbase NFT “will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards,” all NFTs will be on-chain, and there are plans for multi-chain support “soon after” launch. Besides whatever curated feed the company plans to introduce, Coinbase NFT seems similar what competitor OpenSea offers as the current NFT marketplace du jour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9jUpK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, what seems to be missing from Coinbase’s plans is any kind of Layer-2 scaling integration, the popular method for reducing the costs and environmental impact of minting and trading art on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are criticized for the way they replicate some of the inequitable and speculative parts of the real-world art market, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;they also carry plenty of environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt; because of how much energy is required to run the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWGJ8C"&gt;Coinbase’s plans are early and could possibly change, but if another NFT showroom/trading floor sparks your curiosity, the company already has &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce"&gt;a waitlist for early access&lt;/a&gt; you can join.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charter asks ex-customers to resubscribe or risk their credit scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NlssuVWZAd7qHeSfEhNDqXtX9aE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986448/acastro_170712_1847_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;Charter has been telling former customers that it’ll forgive their debts and stop reporting them to credit agencies if they resubscribe to the company’s Spectrum TV, internet, or voice service, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-10-12/column-spectrum-billing-threat"&gt;according to a story from the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “one-time courtesy” offer came to light after Steve Schklair, who says he hasn’t been a Spectrum customer for years and doesn’t owe the company money, shared a letter describing the supposed deal with the&lt;em&gt; LA Times. &lt;/em&gt;Charter later confirmed the letter was authentic, saying that it was an offer that was meant to help consumers “reconnect” to Spectrum, as well as get a leg up on their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV7ToN"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;, the letter Charter sent Schklair said the company would cancel his (supposed) debts after he resubscribed and that his new account would be in good standing. It seemingly implied that Charter had been reporting that debt to credit reporting agencies (potentially bringing down Schklair’s credit score) and that he would no longer have to worry about that if he was a customer again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jzkeDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reporting debts is Charter’s legal right — but Schklair says the offer still feels like blackmail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhKUtr"&gt;The letter tries to paint it as a charitable offer from the ISP, saying that a good credit history helps you get credit cards and better mortgage rates. While the company has a history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21157801/stop-spectrum-junk-mail-how-to-spam-calls-online-form"&gt;sending customers an annoying amount of letters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; hilariously points out that this one comes off as “Sopranos-like,” almost as if the company is saying, “You’ve made a nice life for yourself. Be a shame if something happened to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03FxJH"&gt;Charter has a legal right to report an ex-customer’s debts to credit report agencies if they still owe money — that’s how the credit reporting system works, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421193/credit-reporting-infrastructure-errors-experian-equifax-transunion"&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;. But if the letter was offering no-strings-attached debt forgiveness, or even a reasonable debt repayment plan, it probably wouldn’t be described as “sleazy” and “corporate blackmail,” “filled with real and implied threats” by some of the people receiving it. It’s hard to come off as altruistic if you’re not telling people about the better options they have and just trying to get them to give you their money again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jn6au7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spectrum customer service reps couldn’t find outstanding payments for Schklair’s account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9ykb"&gt;Making the situation feel even grosser, Charter may have sent the debt forgiveness offer to Schklair for no reason — he told the&lt;em&gt; LA Times &lt;/em&gt;that Charter hasn’t been dinging his credit reports, the company hadn’t been contacting him about missed payments, and that two customer service reps said he didn’t owe anything (Charter said it wouldn’t discuss Schklair’s individual case for privacy reasons). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Charter said the letter was a “highly targeted promotional offer for former customers who have an outstanding past-due balance of at least two years, and are currently in the collections process” and that the offer made it so customers would be able to escape collections without paying that balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8nGKw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, a competitor to Charter, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRFxry"&gt;I’m not a financial advisor, but I’ve heard most of the experts say that you should be wary of offers from companies saying you can consume your way to financial freedom. The offer in the letter reported by the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; goes from $50 to $75 after a year — a big jump that someone who struggled with payments in the past may have a hard time dealing with (unless they’re counting on Spectrum to lock them into a cycle of debt forgiveness offers). While trying to woo customers back is standard corporate stuff, maybe Charter should consider either going back to the standard “we miss you” letters or making actually helpful offers to customers rather than a way to trap them back in the same debt cycle (provided, of course, that the customer was even in debt in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vudu brings its TV and movie streaming app to Facebook’s Oculus VR devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKUhQBU02LA92TvQhDfC-KpklI8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986282/Vudu_Debuts_on_Oculus_with_Free_Guy_Rental.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vudu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1khS8"&gt;Vudu’s freemium streaming app is now supported on Facebook’s Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;Quest 1 and Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; VR devices, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; more than a hundred 3D titles are available to buy or rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKN1LQ"&gt;The Fandango-owned streaming service — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;was purchased&lt;/a&gt; from Walmart last year — supports both free, ad-supported movies and TV, as well as rentals and purchases. In addition to the 100-plus titles available on Vudu in 3D, the service additionally offers more than 200,000 titles to rent or buy to stream on other devices, as well as thousands of ad-supported titles. It’s the first time that the app is supported on VR devices, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUZ17Q"&gt;“We’re thrilled to be working with Oculus to help transport fans to new worlds in the most immersive formats available,” Fandango’s chief commercial officer Kevin Shepela said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G81nLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service offers more than 100 titles in 3D&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Vwuc"&gt;A Fandango spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment about whether it planned to expand to other VR devices as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRf7zA"&gt;Following its acquisition of Vudu last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607391/vudu-fandango-now-combining-roku-movies-tv"&gt;Fandango pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on its FandangoNow streaming service — indicating it felt that Vudu was the clear way forward in the streaming space. In addition to its rentals, Vudu emphasizes the large number of 4K UHD titles it can stream, far more than many rivals (though support for UHD streaming on most major services has expanded significantly in the last couple of years). Per the Vudu spokesperson, films available to rent in 3D on Oculus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v30fH8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HMCy61"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Meg&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0T8zVJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Live Die Repeat&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1vF5Bt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rampage&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dObMx7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hMnKDs"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hh9uga"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon 2 &lt;/em&gt;($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7hEHKS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRxq4v"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Saw: The Final Chapter &lt;/em&gt;($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Swuscu"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minions&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ae1gIw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Everest&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aangjU"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Retribution&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lGPsiQ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;X-Men: Days of Future Past&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m1OOOe"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Last Knigh&lt;/em&gt;t ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Okrw8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sT1eU1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Walk&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IUtJAl"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Boss Baby: Family Business&lt;/em&gt; ($5.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pPuuYo"&gt;The service also allows 3D movie and TV purchases and 2D/3D bundles. &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; are available to buy in 3D for $14.99 and $19.99, respectively. &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; bundles can be purchased for $24.99 and $34.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA authorizes first e-cigarette but only allows tobacco flavors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJvNHkqsVLWlXJRp1XVw3gjYSm8=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986176/vaping.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kztesM"&gt;After rejecting over one million e-cigarette related products, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it authorized its first e-cigarette: the Vuse Solo, made by R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company. The agency is allowing the company’s tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods on the market but rejected its flavored pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxavAo"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665333/fda-vaping-flavors-authorization-juul"&gt;over a month&lt;/a&gt; since the FDA’s deadline for its review of vapes and e-cigarettes. Early September marked the end of a yearlong period where companies were allowed to keep selling their products, even though agency regulations said that any new tobacco products need authorization before they can be marketed. Now, anything sold&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;without authorization is being marketed illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KccU8z"&gt;Companies submitted applications for 6.5 million vaping and e-cigarette products, and the agency has rejected or said the applications were incomplete for the vast majority. The FDA says its decisions center on whether the benefits of an e-cigarette product to adult smokers — who may use it to quit smoking — outweigh the risk of hooking kids and teenagers on nicotine for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3hPO2"&gt;The tobacco-flavored Vuse e-cigarettes are the first that the FDA says meet that bar. Around 10 percent of high school students who vape use Vuse products, according to the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey. But teens are less likely to use tobacco flavors, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA rejected 10 of Vuse’s flavored e-liquid pods and is still reviewing its application for a menthol flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRI9Pl"&gt;The agency said in its statement that it’s also restricting R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company’s advertising around its e-cigarettes to make it less likely teens will see the ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVtyPX"&gt;The FDA still hasn’t ruled on 2 percent of the submitted vaping and e-cigarette applications. That includes applications from Juul, a market leader and the company that’s been most heavily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928616/juul-ecig-vaping-fda-raid-inspection-smoking-nicotine"&gt;criticized and blamed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850376/juul-ecigs-vaping-fda-smoking-nicotine-health-science"&gt;attracting kids&lt;/a&gt; and teenagers to vaping. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly can’t get enough chips for the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIk7a3dRnllE-5WPncwjzWcYPYc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986132/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfElgh"&gt;The chip shortage is hitting the iPhone 13, with Apple reportedly unable to get enough parts to hit its planned manufacturing goals, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-aapl-to-cut-iphone-production-targets-due-to-chip-shortage?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had originally planned to produce 90 million iPhones in the final months of 2021, but it’s reportedly slashing that number by 10 million (or around 11 percent) due to supply issues with chips from Broadcom and Texas Instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy8ePE"&gt;While the primary A15 Bionic SoC on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro is manufactured by TSMC, there are plenty of other chip-based components inside the phone that come from other sources. As iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723209%2Fapple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thorough teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro’s logic board&lt;/a&gt; shows, Texas Instruments and Broadcom are responsible for several key components, including chips that handle display power management, Face ID’s laser array, USB connectivity, wireless power, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yaz8Ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6KZnLs"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;already warned&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it might see chip supply issues, noting that “we’ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we’re dealt.” But it seems that even with Apple’s best efforts and favorable relationships with suppliers, it just can’t get the physical components together that it needs to make enough iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19nqBT"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will eventually manage to get production up, but the slashed manufacturing estimate means that it’ll probably be even more difficult to find an (already tough to get ahold of) iPhone 13 in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YmjrpX"&gt;On Tuesdays for the remainder of the year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be featuring additional new episodes, with each focused on a specific topic usually discussed on our regular Friday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWSbB6"&gt;Today, we start our run with a discussion on the reviews we haven’t talked too much about yet on the show: this year’s software and hardware endeavors from Microsoft. In this episode, Dieter hosts a roundtable on reviews for the Microsoft products launched this fall:  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22713963/microsoft-surface-go-3-review"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJHY7C"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5923826643&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zTsPD"&gt;Dieter is joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewers Tom Warren, Monica Chin, and Dan Seifert, who have all reviewed the products, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONmJfV"&gt;The show answers questions like: Why does Windows 11 feel unfinished? How do the new Surface products fit in with a new operating system? How flexible of a machine (in both power capability and mode switching) are the new Surfaces for the thin and light class of devices? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuYAoA"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has banned nearly 1,000 ‘militarized social movements,’ documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-RACISM-PROTEST-UNREST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1U45EKUm8pqhnERNMgY_0IwgD6I=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985642/1227795113.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEFF DEAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="68Retr"&gt;Facebook has placed at least 986 groups on a private list of banned “militarized social movements,” according to internal Facebook documents &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The documents hint at the scale of militia organizing on Facebook — something the company cracked down on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-hit-facebook-crack-down-n1237330"&gt;in August of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqKvKW"&gt;Militarized social movements are one part of Facebook’s larger “dangerous individuals and organizations” list, which &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21083395-dio-2"&gt;published a snapshot of&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety. The term refers to armed groups that promote armed conflict, as well as groups that support violence or looting at protests; in practice, it’s apparently composed largely of right-wing militias with some left-wing, anarchist, or generally anti-government organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rnIdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an adversarial space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpENEg"&gt;Facebook’s “dangerous individuals” list also includes white supremacist bands, hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and branches of Al Qaeda and other global terrorist organizations. All are banned from maintaining pages, groups, or profiles on the service. Beyond that, the categories are sorted into tiers. Tier 1 includes hate and terror groups, and Facebook users can’t express praise or support for them in any form. Tier 2 includes “violent non-state actors” like armed rebels that can only be praised for nonviolent activities. Militarized social movements are designated as Tier 3, which don’t have comparable restrictions on how users discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qad9Nk"&gt;Facebook noted in October of 2020 that it had identified 600 militarized social movements and removed around 2,400 pages and 14,200 groups maintained by them. The company also said it had removed 1,700 pages and 5,600 groups associated with QAnon — which is designated a militarized social movement but is not an organized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBDZ0u"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes, the group designations can be fuzzy. One subset of the violent boogaloo movement, for instance, is classified as a Tier 1 terrorist organization, while the larger movement is a militarized social movement. The designation also includes news outlets like the anarchist site &lt;em&gt;It’s Going Down — &lt;/em&gt;which could theoretically have been grouped under the umbrella of “supporting violent acts amid protests” but is listed as an “armed militia group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVNb3g"&gt;Facebook has been criticized for both overly lax and overly punitive enforcement. But most recently, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;come under general scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; for not releasing details about its operations to outside researchers or policymakers, something that makes it more difficult to evaluate its moderation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIGnEj"&gt;In statements to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook said it had not previously released the list because publishing too many details might compromise the effectiveness of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
