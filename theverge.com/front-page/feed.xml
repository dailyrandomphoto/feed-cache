    <title>The new Motorola Edge gets a 108-megapixel camera but ditches the edge display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGvwBZN9FIO3y82ldrGugAWgMx4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749378/edge.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9D1ly"&gt;Motorola has a new version of its $700 Edge smartphone, bringing better cameras, a more modern processor, and an updated design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUpRAK"&gt;As with last year’s Edge, the new model doesn’t quite offer the best hardware Android has to offer, with a Snapdragon 778 5G processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, or 8GB RAM / 256GB storage, but those sacrifices might be worth it for the decidedly midrange price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNbqBS"&gt;Despite that, the new Edge does feature the 108-megapixel camera that was one of the marquee features on the Edge Plus, along with a larger 5,000mAh battery and mmWave 5G — both of which were also offered on the Edge Plus but were downgraded to a 4,500mAh battery and sub-6GHz-only specs on last year’s Edge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPL4-EVXAsWWm3hWTNZ6aLNXNqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791020/Motorola_edge__2021__design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkzgT1"&gt;The display is a 6.8-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, but calling the new phone the Edge (with no numbering to help distinguish it from the 2020 model) is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that the 2021 model ditches the “endless edge” waterfall display that gave the original Edge and Edge Plus their names. That said, given that the curved screen was by and large a gimmick on last year’s models, it’s not much of a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJSipX"&gt;Cameras are the aforementioned 108-megapixel main camera, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that offers Motorola’s “Macro Vision” feature, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. A 32-megapixel front-facing camera rounds out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlooYj"&gt;Still missing on the spec sheet is any form of wireless charging, although the new Edge does add some extremely basic IP52 water resistance (which, while better than nothing, is basically just enough to protect from the odd bit of rain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2YQ4t2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kAPH4y"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same hardware as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"&gt;trio of Edge 20 models&lt;/a&gt; that Motorola released internationally earlier this summer (which, among other differences, feature smaller 6.7-inch displays) although it most closely resembles the middle-of-the-road Edge 20 in specs. The Edge 20 does beat the North American model Edge in a few areas, however: it features an 16-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera as its other two rear cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bytbmy"&gt;The latest version of the Edge is also definitively a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;last year’s regular Edge model&lt;/a&gt; — not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;premium flagship Edge Plus hardware&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to challenge high-end phones from Samsung and OnePlus. For now, there’s no word on Motorola as to whether it’ll be trying again at competing in the crowded high-end Android market in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veVCeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another “limited time” discount&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSXO30"&gt;Pricing for the 2021 Edge also matches last year: it’ll technically be sold for $699.99, but Motorola is once again offering a “limited-time” discount right from the start to drop the price down to a more wallet-friendly $499.99. The company isn’t saying how long that price will be offered at this time, although if it’s anything like last year, sales won’t be too hard to come by. It’ll be available in the US unlocked from sellers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website, with carrier versions from Verizon and Spectrum mobile planned “in the coming months.” A release in Canada is also planned for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces price increase for Office 365 and Microsoft 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNlP0aQzKkCaMoIwB3D48bLMOb8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749355/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lLml0y"&gt;Microsoft is announcing its first price increase for its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 services in a decade. The price increases will affect commercial and business users of Microsoft’s software as a service (SaaS) offerings next year, with no changes to pricing for education or consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYkuJi"&gt;Microsoft’s updated pricing will go into effect on March 1st, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wGyJEK"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wi4TSv"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6dmdIh"&gt;Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="edXloD"&gt;Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aSTq8e"&gt;Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l4MiI3"&gt;Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="egueXH"&gt;Microsoft first launched Office 365 in 2011 across 40 different markets, and the company has been improving it ever since. These price changes mark “the first substantive pricing update since we launched Office 365 a decade ago,” explains Microsoft 365 chief Jared Spataro &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F08%2F19%2Fnew-pricing-for-microsoft-365%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HoXkj"&gt;They also come as Microsoft has reported a record year of revenue growth thanks to cloud services like Office 365. Microsoft has more than 300 million paid seats for Office 365, so the price changes will certainly bump Microsoft’s profits and revenue even further next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktvnEH"&gt;While larger businesses will have benefited from bulk discounts and deals over the past decade, it’s the small businesses that will feel the effects of an increase in pricing as the economy starts to recover from a pandemic. Either way, Microsoft has added more than 20 apps to Office 365 since it originally launched, including Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, and To-Do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gave phone makers extra money to ditch third-party app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeyzJWMk7qsaf45JgKUy8xZ5Ry0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749321/akrales_190326_3320_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaX9Ha"&gt;Newly unredacted sections of Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;antitrust complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt; reveal new details on the lengths to which Google went to undermine third-party app stores on the Android platform. According to the new text, starting in 2019, Google ran a “Premier Device Program” that gave Android phone makers a greater share of search revenue than they would normally receive. In exchange, the OEMs agreed to ship their devices without any third-party app stores preinstalled. Specifically, they followed a rule that prohibited “apps with APK install privileges” without Google’s approval, leaving the Play Store as the only built-in digital marketplace for software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wurOxS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428411904381304845"&gt;As noted by Leah Nylen&lt;/a&gt;, products that qualified as a Premier Device would receive a 12 percent share of Google search revenue compared to the 8 percent they’d normally earn. Google sweetened the deal further for companies like LG and Motorola, offering them between 3 and 6 percent of what customers spent in the Google Play Store on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQ1Kv"&gt;“Google’s Premier Device Program was not publicly known, and was not known to Epic, before Google recently began producing relevant documents in this litigation,” Epic’s lawyers wrote in the complaint. “Google has sought to conceal its most restrictive anticompetitive conduct by, among other things, including in the agreements themselves a provision restricting signatories from making ‘any public statement regarding [the] Agreement without the other party’s prior written approval.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqEJpi"&gt;The complaint goes on to paint the Premier Devices Program as a resounding success that has only further solidified the Play Store’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VasOxh"&gt;By May 2020, many of the world’s largest and most popular Android OEMs had agreed to Google Play exclusivity for most of their new Android devices. Motorola and LG both committed nearly all (98 percent and 95 percent) of their devices to the Premier program. The giant Chinese conglomerate BBK — which manufactures and sells a range of Android devices under its Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus brands, among others, had designated around 70 percent of its new devices as “Premier.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hm6Lr7"&gt;Here’s where Epic goes into detail on the Premier Device Program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRU6nc"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.documentcloud.org/embed/enhance.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KyFJGb"&gt;Other companies like Sony (50 percent) and Xiaomi (40 percent) weren’t as committed to the program. Still, Epic argues in its complaint that the program effectively tilted the scales against third-party stores on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9660h"&gt;Another newly public section of the complaint shows how rare it is for people to venture outside the Play Store’s walls. Epic says that an internal Google report from 2017 found that “app installations through channels other than Google Play (including direct downloads and competing app stores) amounted to a mere 4.4 percent of Android app downloads in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ‘Project Hug’ paid out huge sums to keep game devs in the Play Store, Epic filing claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsnjAU9HiXs_Gw9OQU8xeAWFUg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749290/wjoel_180413_1777_android_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMnvO4"&gt;Google quietly paid game developers hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives to keep their games on the Play Store, a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.165.1.pdf"&gt;newly unredacted complaint&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The program was known as “Project Hug,” or later as the “Apps and Games Velocity Program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntG3a4"&gt;In 2018, when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for Android first launched, Epic Games took the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store"&gt;unusual step of exclusively releasing&lt;/a&gt; it outside of the Google Play Store. Instead, players had to download an installer directly from Epic’s website, allowing the company to bypass Google’s 30 percent fee — at the cost of a less user-friendly installation process. Epic Games would eventually relent and release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the Play Store in April 2020&lt;/a&gt; (at least, until it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation"&gt;was removed again by Google&lt;/a&gt; after Epic added a feature allowing players to bypass Google’s fee when making in-app purchases, kicking off the current slate of lawsuits.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foFRrI"&gt;But Epic’s complaint alleges that Google was so concerned about the idea of other developers following &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s lead — and cutting it out of the lucrative business — that it launched a program called “Project Hug” to make sure that developers would stick with the Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mCiQL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google was reportedly worried that other developers would follow Epic’s lead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbm2Cl"&gt;According to the complaint, a 2019 report compiled by Google Play’s finance team raised concerns that Epic could arrange a deal with OEMs like Samsung to preinstall its competing store, winning over developers with promises of lower revenue splits (a tactic Epic uses with the PC-based version of its store) and helping pave the way for Android users to turn to other alternative storefronts. In total, the team estimated that the Epic Games Store on Android could result in a lost of between $350 million and $1.4 billion to Google by 2022; if other app stores like Amazon’s or Samsung’s “gained full traction” alongside Epic, those losses could grow from $1.1 billion to $6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agIQWI"&gt;Project Hug was designed as part of the effort to limit Epic’s influence, as “a hug developers close and show love plan,” or “a surge plan to throw extra love/promotion to top developers and games (including Tencent portfolio companies),” Android executives explained in internal documents. In practice, that translated in more practical terms to spending “hundreds of millions of dollars on secret deals with over 20 top developers” that the company had deemed most at risk of falling to Epic’s “contagion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NicuPn"&gt;Google’s documents note that, while many of the targeted developers had inquired about revenue share or considered their own distribution platforms, Project Hug was largely a success. By the end of 2020, Google had signed deals with most of its Project Hug targets — most notably Activision Blizzard — to keep them in the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s store-crashing GTA V freebie brought more than 7 million new users to its online marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGqjoBoa3WeSjqbRBM-lcxu0-z8=/57x0:3297x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749206/476_3840.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="focwv9"&gt;In May 2020, Epic Games offered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; for free on the Epic Games Store, a deal that proved to be so popular it took down the store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;for more than eight hours&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to documents discovered as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, we now have an idea of just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; popular the deal was: according to an internal Epic slide, it brought more than 7 million new users to Epic’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpW9z0"&gt;You can see the slide below, which also shows how many new users other freebies brought to the Epic Games Store. While other games like &lt;em&gt;Subnautica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Civilization 6 &lt;/em&gt;drove a good number of signups (just under 1 million and 2.5 million, respectively), nothing comes close to the 7 million people who joined for &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImLIbD"&gt;But even though &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; brought a tidal wave of new users, the Epic Games Store still has a long way to go to catch up with its primary competitor, Steam. Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-self-publishing-closed-beta-opens-today"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that the Epic Games Store has 58 million monthly active users, but that’s a little less than half of the more than 120 million monthly active players that Valve &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/2961646623386540826"&gt;last reported are on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvRL9V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, Epic reported 56 million monthly active users &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the platform has only jumped 2 million users since then. That’s a slower rate of growth than the store has seen in the past — by comparison, monthly active users jumped from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million in December 2020, or an average of 2 million monthly active users more &lt;em&gt;per month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u17YJa"&gt;Despite the slower growth, Epic still seems very committed to its platform. Alongside the news of the platform’s 58 million monthly active users, Epic announced a closed beta for self-publishing on the Epic Games Store. When self-publishing is available to all, it might open the floodgates for more developers to host their games on Epic’s store, which could bring in new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i83Y0f"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;other documents from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; describe an Epic initiative called “Project Moonshot” with a goal of getting the Epic Games Store to $1 billion in gross revenue by investing in “major launches, free games, and key sale(s).” It seems likely we’ll continue to see big pushes from Epic like the &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; freebie and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18293453/borderlands-3-release-date-trailer-xbox-ps4-pc-epic-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3’s&lt;/em&gt; initial Epic Games Store PC exclusivity at launch&lt;/a&gt; (which Epic paid $146 million to secure, the documents reveal) to attract gamers to its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans to prohibit sexually explicit content beginning in October </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dSzrxwGxj92iIHuL5aoi-hHdyE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749152/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6qjUz"&gt;Video sharing site OnlyFans, best known for its creators’ adult videos and photos, will prohibit sexually explicit content starting October 1st. First &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it is making the changes because of pressure from its banking and payment provider partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcpuBo"&gt;“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” OnlyFans said in a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G7ho3"&gt;Creators on the platform will still be allowed to post nude images as long as they comply with the site’s &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt;. More information will be available in the coming days, the company added: “OnlyFans remains committed to the highest levels of safety and content moderation of any social platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uXlUB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnlyFans pushes SFW app on iOS and Android as it tries to shake adult image","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BIZYVI"&gt;OnlyFans claims more than 2 million creators — who it says have earned more than $5 billion on its platform — and 130 million users. Last year, the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;generated $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in sales (of which OnlyFans receives a 20 percent cut). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FUT9G"&gt;The company is seeking investors at a valuation of more than $1 billion but has had difficulty attracting investors, &lt;a href="http://axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;according to a report from&lt;em&gt; Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of the proliferation of porn on the site (&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes the company didn’t mention pornography at all in its pitch deck to investors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A5uq7"&gt;Despite its ability to draw eyeballs, and the safer environment it provides sex workers, online porn is a hard sell for investors. Recall that as Verizon prepared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast"&gt;sell Tumblr to Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;permanently banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, a highly controversial move at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBrU92"&gt;Along with the announcement about sexually explicit content, OnlyFans published its first &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;monthly transparency report for July&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, “as part of our commitment to safety and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjjJbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 RT is reportedly on the way, but not for North America or Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRhACtAz2Fq9RI5-MNtmbh7OlKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749115/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus N200, a sub-$300 phone, is the kind of budget device the company is offering in the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOzJfA"&gt;OnePlus may be getting ready to launch another variant of its 9-series phones, the 9 RT, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-rt-october-oxygenos-12"&gt;according to an &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; source&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the report, it looks to be a slightly upgraded version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348430/oneplus-9r-specs-price-availability"&gt;the OnePlus 9R&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched earlier this year with more modest specs than the flagship 9 and 9 Pro. That model never made it to North America, and it seems this will also be the case for the 9 RT. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;the 9 Pro base model&lt;/a&gt;. But who’s keeping track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqvGAG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, the OnePlus 9 RT will launch in October with a Snapdragon 870 processor, 120Hz OLED, a 4,500mAh battery, and OxygenOS 12 out of the box. For its main rear-facing camera, it will reportedly use the 50-megapixel sensor behind the same (very good) ultrawide as in the 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7dodMO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgEhY8"&gt;The OnePlus 9 RT will debut in China and India, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, and there are no plans to make it available in North American or European markets. That’s not too surprising, and it tracks with OnePlus’ recent strategy of limiting US releases to the high-end likes of the 9 and 9 Pro, along with the budget-oriented N200 and N10 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxyUYs"&gt;It’s possible that OnePlus sees an opportunity to gobble up some of the budget market share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;formerly occupied by LG&lt;/a&gt; and has focused its US strategy accordingly. In any case, it looks increasingly clear that bringing midrange devices like the Nord 2 and upper-midrangers like this rumored 9 RT to the US aren’t part of the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prime Video releases new profile images for Amazon originals </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZPhLFQz6VUqh7xwt-qtKz30Nmo=/317x0:2218x1267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749085/PrimeVideo_Profile_Images_Aug2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEp0Yf"&gt;Prime Video is giving users more options for personalizing their user profiles with the addition of characters from its original series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtGfc3"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315370/amazon-prime-video-user-profiles-kids-household-wallet-sharing"&gt;introduced user profiles&lt;/a&gt; to its Prime Video service last year, and it previously allowed supported personalized images for individual user accounts. Now, however, users can choose to make their account avatar a character from one of nearly two dozen Amazon original series, including &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikQxTu"&gt;To change a user icon on Prime Video’s website, head to the Prime Video homepage and click “Manage Profiles” from the “Who’s Watching?” menu in the upper right corner. To change a user profile image on iOS, Android, and Fire devices, head to the “My Stuff” menu in the Prime Video app. Click on the profiles drop-down menu and then select “Edit.” From there, click on the user profile image to choose from one of Amazon’s new originals icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Lrj0r"&gt;The new additions mark the first time the service has introduced profile image options for popular characters from its originals. Amazon’s older icons will still be available on the service, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those can be found under the “Animals,” “Archetypes,” “Classic,” and “Moods” categories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Vanguard brings the series back to WWII in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LInLV3hYLb8TrXQygLQRMqhFcCU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748674/Vanguard_Reveal_04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfhRi5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627527/call-of-duty-vanguard-teaser-warzone-event-activision"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, Sledgehammer Games officially announced the next &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; with the reveal of &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, which will be launching in November. The new shooter is set during World War II and will feature a “historically inspired” single-player campaign, along with a multiplayer mode and integration with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Zombies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78YPyZ"&gt;The announcement comes as Sledgehammer’s parent company Activision Blizzard, and in particular &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; developer Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;has come under fire for a culture of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;spurred by a lawsuit filed by the state of California&lt;/a&gt;. Since then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;employees have staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;multiple high-profile developers at Blizzard have left the studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;including president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmUeAq"&gt;During a meeting with press last week, Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon opened with a statement regarding the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wQX9qB"&gt;The stories and the pain that have been shared are simply devastating. We love making games, it’s what we do, it’s our life’s work, and we love it. But more importantly we’re humans, we’re here for each other, working side by side, and looking out for one another in good times and in bad. So on behalf of Sledgehammer Games, and all of the team supporting &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, harassment of any kind goes against everything we stand for as a studio. Everyone, regardless of their title, role, gender, orientation, or ethnicity deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQniD6"&gt;While we can’t comment on the lawsuit, what I can say is that as a team we are committed to making sure all team members feel safe, welcome, and respected. So please know that these thoughts and actions are at the top of our minds, and will be going forward. They speak to the core values of who we are and who we wish to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ij4YXW"&gt;As for the game itself, the core of &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is its single-player campaign, which focuses on the origin of the special forces and will be told from multiple points of view; in addition to the Sledghammer narrative team, sci-fi writer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tochi_Onyebuchi"&gt;Tochi Onyebuchi&lt;/a&gt; is also working on the story. Sledgehammer says the narrative will cover “the untold stories of multinational heroes that formed Task Force One, changing the face of history and setting the stage for special forces as we know it.” It’ll feature a cast of characters inspired by real-world personalities, like Lt. Polina Petrova, based on Soviet sniper &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko"&gt;Lyudmila Pavlichenko&lt;/a&gt;, also known as “Lady Death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BuPuio"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10709077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jzXmT"&gt;Outside of the campaign, there will be multiplayer with 20 maps at launch and game modes including “Champion Hill” where players duel solo or in squads of two or three. There will also be a &lt;em&gt;Zombies&lt;/em&gt; mode developed by &lt;em&gt;Black Ops&lt;/em&gt; studio Treyarch which will connect with the previous undead story from &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLpGUv"&gt;At the same time, Raven Software is leading development on a &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; map for the battle royale spinoff &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. When the new map launches later this year, it’ll be accompanied by a “new anti-cheat system,” according to Activision. The company describes the crossover as an “all-new metaverse connecting &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfU33H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is launching on November 5th and will be coming to the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone and Destiny are making moves to fight cheaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6ksbHC3VCgO7C2Pn9CDlyZaNlk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748667/cod_warzone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXjsFZ"&gt;Alongside its reveal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22395356"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Activision Blizzard announced that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, its popular, free-to-play battle royale, will receive an update later this year that weaves a new “multi-faceted” anti-cheat system into the game. It will arrive alongside a brand-new map that’s currently in development by Raven Studios, though the system will work across all of &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZKg2Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating has been a huge problem for &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;since it launched in early 2020, as it is for almost every online competitive game, yet Activision Blizzard’s attempts to thwart cheaters — particularly in ranked matches — haven’t worked. The company hasn’t detailed exactly how its new system aims to succeed where it hasn’t before, as well as whether it’s being built internally or is licensed, but we’ll likely hear more as we get closer to the feature’s release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eNCqC"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is no longer operated by Activision Blizzard, Bungie announced today that it, too, will be incorporating an improved anti-cheat service into its game. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1428377075287662593"&gt;it will be “soft launching” a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.battleye.com/"&gt;BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; when the next season launches. Like &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; has been plagued by cheaters who ruin the experience for people who want to enjoy and progress through the game. Bungie will likely share more details during &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Direct/DestinyShowcase"&gt;its next &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;Showcase&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, August 24th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
