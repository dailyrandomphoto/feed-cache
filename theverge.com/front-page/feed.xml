    <title>Faraday Future is going public and raising $1 billion</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kgbKUD"&gt;Faraday Future is going to become a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and is raising around $1 billion in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEvr52"&gt;The troubled EV startup &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005488/en/Faraday-Future-to-List-on-NASDAQ-Through-Merger-With-Property-Solutions-Acquisition-Corp.-With-Estimated-1-Billion-in-Proceeds"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it is indeed merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition corporation&lt;/a&gt; (or SPAC) Property Solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/19/22229493/faraday-future-spac-merger-psac-public-ipo-stock"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wKoen"&gt;About $230 million will come from the money that Property Solutions raised in its SPAC. The other $775 million will come from a new funding round happening concurrently with the merger. Geely, China’s biggest privately owned automaker, is contributing “less than 10 percent” of that new investment, and $175 million is coming from an unnamed “Tier 1 Chinese City,” meaning that the Chinese government is involved in the deal. Faraday Future will have around $748 million of cash to play with when all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESSqTn"&gt;Faraday Future expects to be able to finish building out its factory in Hanford, California with the new funds and launch its FF91 luxury SUV “within 12 months” of the finalization of the merger, which is expected to happen in the second quarter of this year. Smaller models, as well as a delivery vehicle, will follow. Faraday Future is targeting the US, China, and European markets and has an agreement with South Korean manufacturer Myoung Shin to make cars there. A joint venture with Geely and the Tier 1 city is also being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O0itDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FF91 luxury SUV will launch 12 months after the deal closes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDhaoN"&gt;While it’s just the latest EV startup to announce that it’s going public via SPAC in the last seven months (joining the likes of Nikola, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival, and others), Faraday Future is perhaps the most notorious considering its history of financial troubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgQsv3"&gt;Going public has long been a goal for Faraday Future, which was founded in 2014 and started to emerge from stealth mode in 2015. But it’s a goal that’s seemed increasingly out of reach as the startup struggled over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEDjfj"&gt;After debuting its electric luxury SUV, the FF91, at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, Faraday Future spiraled. It was facing a major cash crunch after already spending hundreds of millions of dollars of founder Jia Yueting’s own money. At the same time, Jia self-exiled himself to the US as he tried to escape massive mounting debts in his home country, China, following the collapse of his tech conglomerate LeEco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkqhPu"&gt;Faraday Future brought in two former BMW executives to help straighten things out, including the former chief financial officer of the German automaker (and Deutsche Bank), Stefan Krause. The startup abandoned plans to build a $1 billion factory in the desert in favor of taking over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/6/16102758/faraday-future-new-factory-hanford-california"&gt;a smaller, dormant plant in Central California&lt;/a&gt;. Krause pushed for other cost-cutting measures, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16236054/faraday-future-formula-e-electric-racing"&gt;exiting the Formula E electric racing series&lt;/a&gt;, ending &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;LeEco’s technical partnership with Aston Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and scrapping a product placement in the &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; movie franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0pDF0"&gt;But when Jia ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;rejected Krause’s larger pitch to restructure the startup through bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;, the chief financial officer and his BMW counterpart resigned. A wave of other resignations followed. Weeks away from running out of cash, Jia signed a deal at the end of 2017 with Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande worth up to $2 billion in exchange for 45 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoYXZO"&gt;Buoyed by new cash, Faraday Future started off 2018 by renovating the factory in Central California and continuing work on the SUV. But the relationship with Evergrande soured across that year as Jia quickly spent through the conglomerate’s first $800 million installment. When Jia asked for more, Evergrande used the opportunity to try to sideline him. Ultimately, it wasn’t satisfied that Jia actually relinquished control, and the two sides started a months-long legal battle before an arbitrator in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSbSCu"&gt;While this was happening, Faraday Future was down to just a few million dollars in the bank. It laid off hundreds and furloughed hundreds more, and cut salaries across the board. Top executives who had stuck it out, including co-founder Nick Sampson, relented and left the startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XalLKF"&gt;Faraday Future reached a truce with Evergrande on the final day of 2018. The Chinese conglomerate was released from the remaining $1.2 billion and reduced its stake to 32 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pHKdD"&gt;Faraday Future has been treading water ever since, staying alive by borrowing from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;investment firm run by a “bankruptcy legend.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBlNjh"&gt;Through all this, Faraday Future racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to suppliers and vendors. The startup placated most of them by promising a slice of a future IPO. Jia declared bankruptcy in late 2019 in an effort to settle some $3 billion of his own debts in China. The result of that process was that Jia put his controlling shares in Faraday Future in a trust of which his creditors now all own pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ESQu7"&gt;The makeup of Faraday Future’s ownership is changing with the deal. When it closes, shareholders of the SPAC will own 6.8 percent of the company. The entities doing the $775 million raise will own 23 percent. Creditors that Faraday Future and Jia owe money to will own 17.2 percent. Existing shareholders in Faraday Future will collectively own 51.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnncA2"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global Privacy Control wants to succeed where Do Not Track failed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iL2yRw2r4nEo3HSh36__pE7MvuA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732954/acastro_190703_1777_pixel_tracking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new web standard is playing off of California’s powerful privacy law&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qKPGWk"&gt;On today’s internet, information is nearly impossible to control. It’s become commonplace for a single website visit to spill over into targeted ads (often for something you’ve already bought) or unexpectedly canny spam emails. It’s assumed that information from your browsing history will be available to target your Instagram ads, and despite nominal commitments to privacy, tech companies have mostly given up trying to stop those data flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cg2nIJ"&gt;Privacy groups are hoping that a new standard, called &lt;a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org"&gt;Global Privacy Control&lt;/a&gt;, will change that. It’s designed as a global opt out, a general signal that users want as little data collection and sharing as possible. In particular, the GPC standard will let users signal that they don’t want services to share their data with third-party data brokers, something that is outside the reach of most modern privacy tools. The team hopes that this new signal will give users a way to protect their data after it’s been collected and ensure personal information doesn’t travel too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G77OFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t know if they’re selling data on the back end”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GCoard"&gt;“When you go to a website right now, you don’t know if they’re selling data on the back end,” says DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg, a central player in the project. “But we’re hoping that this signal will stop them from doing that, because it will be legally binding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8DyGS"&gt;The GPC standard sprang from &lt;a href="https://insights.truyo.com/ccpa-hidden-game-changer"&gt;a powerful but little-noticed provision&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; (CCPA), which was strengthened further with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549514/california-prop-24-data-privacy-2020-election-andrew-yang"&gt;the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act in November&lt;/a&gt;. A provision in the law gives Californians the right to opt out of having their personal information sold by the sites they visit. Crucially, the law interprets “sell” as including any exchange of value, which could include being read broadly enough to go beyond outright data broker sales and into the endemic tracking pixels that power much of the advertising you see online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjDWFz"&gt;“That right is supposed to prevent any third-party tracking,” says Ashkan Soltani, who worked on drafting the CCPA and CPRA and has been a pivotal force in drafting the new standard. “There hasn’t been too much enforcement of it but more importantly, people don’t know about it and find the button, so not many people opt out…But the CCPA also has in it the right for users to opt-out through a global privacy control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvDrX"&gt;Global Privacy Control is meant to automate that opt out, letting users click a single button on their browser instead of hunting for the opt out on every website they visit. &lt;a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/press-release/20210128"&gt;Starting today&lt;/a&gt;, browsers from Brave and DuckDuckGo will send the GPC signal by default, and DuckDuckGo plugins will let you bring the same signal to Firefox and Chrome. Privacy Badger, Abine, and Disconnect.me have made similar moves to build the standard into their products. All told, project organizers estimate that 40 million users worldwide will be sending out the GPC signal through one product or another, giving them surprising political muscle when future privacy rules are written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kmXV7q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;40 million users worldwide&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOvfKq"&gt;Site partners like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post, &lt;/em&gt;and Meredith Corp have also agreed to respect the signal, and Automattic (the company that owns WordPress) will honor GPC in its self-hosted sites and internal ad network, spanning hundreds of thousands of sites. It’s a small group compared to the billions of Chrome and Safari users out there, but it will provide a proof-of-concept for the more private web the GPC team is trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IPWaI"&gt;There is still a long way to go before GPC is available outside the cloistered world of web privacy tools. None of the major browsers currently support GPC as a native privacy option, although Mozilla said it supports the effort. The team says they’ve submitted the standard to the W3C, but it will be a long road before it gets approved — with lots of opportunity for ad-friendly tech companies to throw a wrench in the works. The last time privacy advocates tried to build an opt-out system, this is where it fell apart, resulting in the short-lived Do Not Track standard of the mid-‘00s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzRHSe"&gt;But GPC boosters like Weinberg say the CCPA and other pending privacy laws make things different this time. There’s a lot that still needs to happen before GPC has the force of law — in particular, the California attorney general will need to definitively state that the GPC counts as an opt out — but it would give the standard a power that Do Not Track never had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqNXm4"&gt;“The CCPA has passed and the GDPR has provisions that we think map to this signal. So there’s a real case that those laws apply to Global Privacy Control, but it hasn’t been legally proven in the courts,” says Weinberg. “Ultimately, there will probably have to be court cases to fully establish what ‘sale’ means under CCPA and what ‘opt-out’ means under GDPR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9Cd8Z"&gt;The California attorney general declined to comment for this piece, although AG Becerra &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/47115516-3540-4AB8-8676-57882CF6B9E0"&gt;had expressed enthusiasm for the project&lt;/a&gt; before being nominated for a post in the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpdc0l"&gt;The biggest lingering question is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/1/22/21075270/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-nytimes-federal-privacy-law-surveillance"&gt;the long-simmering push for a federal privacy law&lt;/a&gt;, which privacy advocates have been fighting to get through Congress since 2016. As long as GPC relies on California privacy law, it will only matter to California residents — but a federal privacy law could open the standard up to the entire country and potentially strengthen GPC’s protections further. There’s also increasing ambition to expand the opt-out signal beyond the web to apps and the Internet of Things, although such a move would be years away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MZdv"&gt;Even if GPC gets full backing from legislators and courts, it won’t mean an end to targeted advertising or even data sharing. There’s still a lot of targeting that can be done within a single site, and the online ad world will surely get creative in finding loopholes that let them share data further. But establishing a robust opt-out system on the web would still mean a powerful shift in the way personal data works online — and potentially a start to cleaning up the bewildering tangle of data-sharing agreements online. As partners roll out and momentum builds, Weinberg thinks time is on his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="86alro"&gt;“Our view is that websites really have to respect it,” says Weinberg. “It’s only a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets new patch to fix old patch that introduced a game-breaking bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk game discs for PlayStation and XBox consoles. The..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeSWfAPbY3Jv0qGIiAqabHTeais=/0x141:3350x2374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732936/1230147373.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ki014w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s big new 1.1 patch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248682/cyberpunk-2077-update-bug-workaround-cd-projekt-red"&gt;introduced a game-breaking bug earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and now Developer CD Projekt Red is fixing it. A new 1.11 hotfix is available across PC, Stadia, and Xbox / PlayStation consoles today. While it also restores item randomization to a previous state, the primary purpose is to fix the game-breaking part of the “Down on the Street” quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SuIkj"&gt;The quest includes a holocall that’s supposed to trigger progress through the main part of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s storyline, but some players found the call was silent and blocked progress of the game. CD Projekt Red published a workaround after a few hours, and has now followed up with a hotfix after the problem was spotted earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0sdwws"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hotfix 1.11 is available on PC, consoles and Stadia!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This update restores item randomization and fixes a bug which affected some users’ holocall with Takemura in Down on the Street quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SsVYRGfdha"&gt;https://t.co/SsVYRGfdha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TAQmRilNxq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TAQmRilNxq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1354769450726285312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WY5uAK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been plagued by bugs since its release on December 10th, and this marks the fourth hotfix release to quickly fix problems. Most of the bugs and issues haven’t been game-breaking like this one, and it’s encouraging to see CD Projekt Red fix the problem after just a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOgnoI"&gt;CD Projekt Red is &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;also planning&lt;/a&gt; another major 1.2 patch that is supposed to be a “larger, more significant update” that will arrive in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram can now import your WhatsApp chat history on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GpU8TD2Rop8Nn9W0BB1dKs-dp4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732802/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eBGFBy"&gt;Telegram has added the ability to import your chat history from WhatsApp, meaning you won’t loose past conversations if you want to switch messaging services. On iOS the feature arrived with &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807"&gt;version 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, released yesterday and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/27/amid-whatsapp-privacy-backlash-telegram-building-new-tool-for-importing-chats-from-other-apps/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the update doesn’t appear to be live yet on Android. Alongside WhatsApp, chat histories from Line and KakaoTalk can also be imported, according to Telegram’s changelog. We’ve verified that you can import chats from WhatsApp into the latest version (7.4.1) of Telegram and continue the conversation, so long as each WhatsApp user has a Telegram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcEJby"&gt;The addition of the feature comes as Telegram is reporting huge increases in user numbers, with the service now boasting over 500 million active users worldwide. The cause appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted privacy concerns about the Facebook-owned messaging app (WhatsApp later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new policy, and insists it won’t affect the security of consumer chats or profile data). For users jumping ship from WhatsApp to Telegram, being able to take their chat histories with them means one fewer barrier to switching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0xoUSfoeX5T4exuoOpGR8lvO9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265199/IMG_0372.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imports work on a chat-by-chat basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MEQ0g"&gt;The import process works on a chat-by-chat basis, but appears to work for both individual and group conversations, at least with WhatsApp. To import a chat from Facebook’s messaging service, open the relevant conversation, and tap the group or contact name from the top of the chat to open its info screen. From there, the “Export Chat” option opens the iOS Share Sheet, where you’ll see the option to select Telegram. Then, just pick a Telegram chat to import the messages into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSOgud"&gt;Any messages imported into chats have a small “Imported” label on them noting when they were originally sent, and when they were brought into Telegram, and messages are visible to all chat participants. You have the option of importing WhatsApp chat histories with or without their images. Imported messages appear in the order in which they are imported, rather than in the order they were originally sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKgxG9"&gt;Telegram’s support for imported chat histories arrive alongside a handful of other quality of life improvements for the messaging service, like being able to adjust volumes for individual voice chat participants, or reporting “fake groups or channels” that are attempting to impersonate famous people or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fETq7i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just look at this amazing Pac-Man history book</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3tzbq6BnMi4WvcIurATOZNkvCA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732711/12_PACMAN_CE_overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJNUOg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, and to commemorate the occasion, Cook and Becker is releasing a history book later this year — and it looks incredible. While there’s a standard hardcover version of the book for $39, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artwork/3012/pac-man-birth-of-an-icon-pac-man-bandai-namco.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can also buy a $99 special edition that comes with an ingenious Pac-Man-shaped slipcase. There’s even a vinyl pressing of the single “Pac-Man Fever” included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K1v9H"&gt;The book is described as “the first-ever official history book” for the iconic video games series, and it’s written by Arjan Terpstra and Tim Lapetino. Here’s the official description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0b3k"&gt;This new non-fiction narrative volume will journey from creator Toru Iwatani’s “pizza slice” inspiration to the game’s incredible success in arcades and beyond. The book also dives into Pac-Man’s unprecedented impact on pop culture, with more than 40 new interviews from key players around the world, behind-the-scenes stories, documents, images, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UZvSv"&gt;With untold stories, new details, and archival imagery, &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt; showcases the franchise’s complex history from Tokyo to Chicago to Boston, unpacking the stories of video game industry stalwarts Namco and Midway Manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wCiUwA"&gt;If the name Cook and Becker sounds familiar, it’s probably because of the company’s work releasing high-end art prints for games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974054/last-of-us-part-2-ps4-fine-art-prints-cook-and-becker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551618/ghost-of-tsushima-concept-art-prints-sale-pricing-sucker-punch-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with art books like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762996/final-fantasy-15-art-design-book-cook-becker"&gt;a giant tome on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV’&lt;/em&gt;s creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjTnS7"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; book is expected to release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gives recent Pixel device owners more control over Night Sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLmMbA3lhDkA4q02KTyiuaCnMt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732555/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 and 4A 5G (pictured) can enable Night Sight mode automatically.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuJku3"&gt;Thanks to its latest update, the Google Camera app now lets you permanently turn off its Auto Night Sight feature on devices that automatically enable the low-light photography mode, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/27/pixel-5-auto-night-sight/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is available with version 8.1.200 of the app, which started rolling out on Monday. Additionally, the update lets you disable the mode from the app’s flash settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6otdHf"&gt;When Google released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; last year, it tweaked their camera apps to enable Night Sight mode automatically in low-light conditions. But using the feature means photos take longer to capture, so there’ll inevitably be occasions when you don’t want it to automatically come on. Annoyingly, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, the toggle to turn this feature off (on the bottom right of the Camera app) would previously reset whenever the app closed. As of this latest update, Auto Night Sight now remains disabled when you close the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H1ehwj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FuSLyvIx_Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2EwUw"&gt;As well as letting users permanently turn off Auto Night Sight, the latest version of the app also adds a Night Sight toggle into the app’s flash settings. The update doesn’t appear to be available for older Pixel phones, which prompt users to manually turn on Night Sight in low-light conditions rather than enabling it automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp adds biometric authentication for logging in on desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qmpGjkbbPOJoDOZKmcUoJoN9-g=/271x0:3201x1953/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732409/iOS_and_Android.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KIaWdB"&gt;Linking your WhatsApp account to your &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/web/download-and-installation/about-whatsapp-web-and-desktop/?lang=en"&gt;computer’s web browser&lt;/a&gt; or desktop app is getting a little more secure. Soon, if you’ve got biometric authentication enabled on your phone, you’ll have to unlock the app before you can link your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePJaU1"&gt;The company says the new system is intended to ensure that should someone else gain access to your phone, they won’t be able to link your account to their web browser (which, in turn, would allow them to see any messages you send or receive). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yi352l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be clear: WhatsApp (and Facebook) aren’t getting access to your fingerprints or facial recognition scans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlAMey"&gt;The new system will be enabled by default on any iPhone devices running iOS 14 with either Touch ID or Face ID, and any Android devices that have biometric authentication enabled. That means users will have to use it to link their accounts unless they disable biometric authentication for their entire device. Users who don’t have a biometric authentication setup on their phone (or have it turned off) will be able to link their account as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMC3xI"&gt;As with any other use of biometric security on modern smartphones, the new system does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that WhatsApp is accessing or collecting your facial scans or fingerprints. Rather, it’s just using the same biometric data APIs every other app does in order to access the on-device security system as an extra measure of authentication before it allows users to connect their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aECT3T"&gt;So in the same way that using a fingerprint reader to log in to your banking app doesn’t grant Chase or Bank of America your fingerprint scans, using the new biometric unlock system here to link your account to your computer isn’t giving WhatsApp (or Facebook) your personal information either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncXRk7"&gt;WhatsApp says that the new update should be rolling out for compatible devices in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What if you could see even more tabs?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aygQlVv2d1TeKUjpb3yulQMkecM=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732407/2_line_tab_stack_hero_980x551.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XyeUec"&gt;Vivaldi is releasing version 3.6 of the Vivaldi browser with a great and terrible power today: you can now &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/vivaldi-browser-tabs-two-level/"&gt;create two-level tab stacks&lt;/a&gt;, so that grouped tabs can become pseudo-workspaces for whatever you get up to in your browser. Vivaldi first introduced the feature &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/desktop/two-level-tab-stacks-vivaldi-browser-snapshot-2130-3/"&gt;as an experiment&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, but now you can officially indulge in two levels of too many tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SepBqy"&gt;Creating two-level stacked tabs is as easy as holding down the Command or Windows key, selecting whatever tabs you want to be in the stack, and then right-clicking and selecting “New Tab stack” from the drop down menu. You can also achieve the same effect by dragging and holding one tab over another. Clicking on the newly formed tab stack (signified with a white outline) reveals the second row of tabs nestled inside. Tab stacks can be renamed and closed all at once from the right-click drop down menu as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPApu0mWvVF0wyY0zDg3olbNPWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264435/2_line_tab_stack_side_by_side.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivaldi’s two versions of stacked tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQOcBJ"&gt;With the two-level tab stack, each grouping can function as a visually distinct workspace for however many browser-based projects you might have going at once. It could be a way to silo distracting tabs in your window while keeping your tabs neat and preventing you from losing a page when you really need it. Or, could just be another way to hoard even more tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf9SmW"&gt;Vivaldi also lets you put tabs on the sides and the bottom of the browser window, and the new two-level tab feature works in those orientations, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLosqx"&gt;Vivaldi’s Chromium-based browser has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11374806/walt-mossberg-vivaldi-web-browser-opera"&gt;angled towards power users&lt;/a&gt; since its inception. It’s highly customizable, full of features, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21137843/vivaldi-privacy-tools-private-network-browser-settings-security"&gt;seemingly pretty great when it comes to privacy&lt;/a&gt;. The browser even launched &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/vivaldi-the-four-browsers/"&gt;with tab grouping in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, something Google Chrome didn’t start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;rolling out until 2020&lt;/a&gt;. And if you like tree-style tabs, which can “branch” off of and nest inside other tabs, Vivaldi has those, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88SIGx"&gt;For more information on all of Vivaldi’s tab-focused features &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/tab-management/"&gt;you can head here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like to try Vivaldi for yourself, you can download the browser from &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/"&gt;Vivaldi’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s profits rose in 2020 despite the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHUnDzVgsWSW0gab7Iuf7bnTXBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732379/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fyUHE"&gt;Samsung Electronics has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2020-results"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its fourth-quarter earnings, confirming that the company made more money in 2020 than the year before despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit was up to 35.99 trillion won ($32.1 billion) off 236.81 trillion won ($211.5 billion) in revenue for the year, increases of 29.6 percent and 2.78 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEz8rU"&gt;Samsung says its fourth-quarter results were helped by its “company-wide efforts to ensure a stable supply of products and services globally” in the pandemic environment. Quarterly profit was up 26.4 percent year-on-year, largely driven by the display and memory businesses, though the latter was down quarter to quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ANV36K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1gqgzi"&gt;Samsung’s display business had its highest ever quarterly earnings, which the company mainly attributes to high demand from major smartphone manufacturers. (Samsung doesn’t spell it out, but this was the quarter that Apple outfitted its entire new iPhone 12 lineup with OLED panels.) Samsung also reduced its losses from larger displays like TVs and monitors, and calls out a greater demand for contactless services as a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb3f1d"&gt;Samsung expects mobile profit to increase this quarter thanks to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and says it plans to expand its lineup of foldable devices. The display division, meanwhile, expects OLED penetration to continue to increase throughout the smartphone market and beyond, with wider applications in laptops, tablets, and cars. The company will also pursue growth with foldable and slidable displays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the next iOS 14 beta with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to this spring, but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms, including data brokers, to aid in advertising. As it stands right now, Apple lets iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission first or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking, and mobile app companies can still personalize ads so long as they can disclose that with an App Store privacy label.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple cites a study that found the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
