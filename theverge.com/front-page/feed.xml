  &lt;p&gt;Supernatural founder Chris Milk on the future of fitness &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nuuMPH"&gt;In the pandemic we’ve had to shift our lives to be socially distant — we work remotely, we shop online, and we workout at home. Last year, I signed up for a virtual reality workout app called Supernatural, which runs on the Oculus Quest. Now my wife and I use our Quest 2 almost every day to work out in VR. It feels like we’re leaving the house, the music is great, and the workouts are no joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoEezV"&gt;My guest on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; this week is Chris Milk, founder and CEO of Within — which makes Supernatural. Milk has been making VR experiences for a long time — he’s a true pioneer of the field. Supernatural feels like his biggest hit yet, and it feels like fitness might be the perfect application for VR — the one that makes people go out and buy a VR headset just to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JcgqI"&gt;The basic concept of Supernatural is really simple: you put on the headset, and then use the controllers to swat at targets flying in time to music. It’s kind of like dancing or sword fighting. Dance fighting. Most importantly, Supernatural is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; — there isn’t a single other VR app that could get my wife to wear the headset, but Supernatural is so compelling we keep our Quest 2 on a charging dock in the bedroom. And almost anyone who’s ever tried Supernatural on our headset has gone out and bought a Quest 2 almost right away. Like I said, it feels like fitness is the perfect application for VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMRWaV"&gt;So, I wanted to know a lot more about Supernatural, how the business works, and what kinds of strange music licensing deals are needed to make it run. Milk and I talked about all of that, but, as you’ll see, he’s a much bigger thinker than that. Really, this conversation has a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBseQL"&gt;Chris Milk, founder and CEO of Within. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ULTLz"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6608663613" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZMffB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDDgO7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your company, Within, has an app on the Oculus Quest platform called Supernatural. It’s a workout app. The best way that I can describe it is dance fighting. It is very fun. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAo9ac"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a long journey with VR to get to this app, which I think is one of the killer apps of the platform. I want to talk to you about the whole space, but give me just a quick rundown of Within, and your background in VR, and sort of how you’ve gotten to this point.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR6aLx"&gt;I was speaking to my mom recently and she reminded me, as a kid, I was obsessed with skiing, magic, and music videos. All of them in a strange way have ended up in what I’m doing today, but especially so in Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0AkLo"&gt;In more recent times, I’ve spent most of my career exploring how we might use new technologies to create more meaningful human experiences, ideally, more life-changing human experiences. Most of them have been centered around storytelling, entertainment, music, art, and thinking about what we can make that would be impossible to make in the legacy artistic mediums that we were born with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8jyb1"&gt;My career, I started in directing music videos. I worked with Kanye, Arcade Fire, Johnny Cash, U2, many others; moved into interactive music videos on the web as sort of the broadcast medium was transferring from television to the internet, and music videos basically staying the same, just being broadcast to YouTube instead of MTV. I took that opportunity of this new toolset to explore what kind of things I could do with music videos, if I used the tools that the format now offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeJyLI"&gt;That then led to immersive digital installations in museums. And that led to early in, I think it was 2012, I started experimenting and thinking about VR. In 2013, I was working on my first movie and pitching, at the same time, a startup, neither of which I had much idea of what I was doing on either front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXOZkA"&gt;Then, I think 2014, I got a greenlight feature film starring Nick Nolte, incredible actor, dream project. Still one of the best unproduced scripts out there and I’ve been developing it for probably three years. Ben Horowitz said that Andreessen Horowitz would lead the seed round of the company, and I promptly stepped off the movie and founded the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKoroK"&gt;In the early years, we were trying to crack immersive entertainment, essentially figure out what comes after film and television, empowered by the technology of VR. The longer story there is that we were trying to solve a problem that not many people had at all, but through a number of different discoveries, we realized we could use immersive entertainment to solve a different problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkWpWx"&gt;One that my co-founder and I, Aaron, both had, which was that we needed to exercise but we vigorously disliked the act of actually doing so. We sort of thought deeply about what it would take to love rather than loathe exercise. We thought we could fill a gap in the marketplace that we saw. We knew it was there because we were personally sitting right in the middle of it. We quietly pivoted the company in 2018 and we went back into stealth mode. We built Supernatural over the course of two years. We released it in April of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6hO3P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this the vision for where you thought you would be with VR? Your background is making music videos and feature films and big creative projects. And Supernatural just feels like a company that will scale the way a regular company scales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEnfA7"&gt;That’s a great question with a complex answer. I think we were looking at this new technology and thinking as we have most new technologies. I mean, when I say we, primarily Aaron Koblin, my co-founder, and I, who have been working together for a lot longer than we’ve had this company. He used to be at the Google Creative Lab, and I was an independent music video director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXcfVb"&gt;Those aforementioned interactive music videos, most of them were him and I collaborating, him at Google and me sort of as an independent artist and director, and really thinking about what can these new technologies offer that we can’t do with what is currently out there? And when you think about the mediums and the art forms that we love, like cinema and television, radio, these art forms, these artistic mediums came forth through technological innovation, right? It wasn’t Orson Welles tinkering around in his shop trying to figure out how to make a movie, that he invented cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZjfZeE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUReUu"&gt;The technology of cinema was invented by scientists and inventors and technicians. And it was artists that took those technological innovations and figured out how to make, essentially, meaningful human experiences with them. So those technologies, because we’re on an exponential timeline of technological innovation, those kind of innovations previously came out every few decades or so. Now our working premise is that they’re coming out every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrxcIf"&gt;We’re exploring these new technologies and thinking about what could be the next great medium, what comes after cinema, what comes after television. That’s what a lot of our explorations have been around, utilizing technologies on the internet like personalization and interactivity, and then moving into more immersive technologies like motion capture and virtual reality and augmented reality, and just thinking hard: where can these technologies take us as a species? Where can they take us from an artistic standpoint? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOuEb7"&gt;Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is make something that is meaningful to another human being in the way that other things and these other artistic mediums have resonated with us. Ultimately, we’re trying to make something that is life-changing. That is what great art, what great media, what great things do in your life. I think what we’ve come to learn, though, which is really interesting and we didn’t originally understand, is that you can, that changing someone’s life is hard to do with a movie, it’s hard to do in a music video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJZKM9"&gt;I think we both sort of had lofty ideals of what’s possible, but you’re not going to change someone’s life with the music video that you make. You might change someone’s life on the album. I’ve had my life change from certain albums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlW2rO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0ImXi"&gt;That really speaks to the sort of magical power of music, but I’ve never had my life changed by a movie and I was, much of my life, trying to be a filmmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GOKYC"&gt;I think what’s cool is what we learned through the process of this, that if you can utilize all that same intangible magic of art and storytelling and crafted human experience, but calibrate it for a higher purpose; that rather than just entertainment, calibrate it to health, calibrate it to making your life last longer, making your life better from a day-to-day basis, let you have more energy, let you have a clearer head, let you be stronger. Then, you can actually use the power of art for a different purpose and one that actually does hold that original potential of changing someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLOaQJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s really interesting because you gave this very famous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_milk_how_virtual_reality_can_create_the_ultimate_empathy_machine?language=en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TED talk in 2015 saying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, VR was an empathy machine. I think that was really influential for a lot of people. Even my first experience using VR headsets for your products was, we’re going to take you to a different place and you’re going to feel this experience that somebody else feels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9qJ5h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural is very much an experience about yourself, and I hear what you’re saying; it makes sense that you’re an artist, you’re creative, you’re able to think about how people will feel emotionally and how you could guide those emotions and use them for Supernatural, but it’s still a very, I mean this as literally as possible, a very self-centered experience. How do you connect those two ideas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcP4PV"&gt;Yeah, it’s a little bit deceptive when you look at most of the interactive, immersive experiences currently, Supernatural included, are experiences that you’re on your own. That absolutely does not have to be the case. It will not be the case for very much longer when you think about what this technology is. It’s you tapping into a digital format that is connected to the internet, which is connected to anyone else that is also connected to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxHr89"&gt;There haven’t been a lot of things that really strongly utilized the co-presence immersive nature, immersive powers of virtual reality but the small number of experiments and projects that have, are absolutely incredible. The sense of presence that you can feel with another person and the human connectivity that you can experience with another person, especially another person that you have a relationship with, that you’re already close to and familiar with, is unlike anything else that exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eoNnO"&gt;I mean, just to give you a couple of examples, there’s a mini-golf game on the Oculus headset and I routinely play mini-golf on the weekend with my best friend in San Francisco,I  haven’t seen in ages. Growing up in junior high and high school, we used to work at a mini-golf range, coincidentally, together. The experience of wandering around this magical VR mini-golf range as we just sort of casually talk about what’s happening with us recently while playing mini-golf is totally the experience that we would have if we were actually together, and you get that sense of human connectivity that you wouldn’t get over a Zoom, you wouldn’t get over a phone call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ot3TDk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I ask every CEO and executive who comes on the show, what is your decision-making framework? You’re building something entirely new, how do you evaluate and prioritize what to do? How do you make decisions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXtVpG"&gt;Yeah, good question. I mean, of course, every decision is different and has a multitude of different factors and variables that you’re considering, but I think on the highest level the way we think about it is, we are humans and we are using technology to make things for other humans. And that technology is just a tool, and not to get so caught up in the technology, but really think about what is the end experience for that member and what is going to matter to them? What’s going to resonate with them? What’s going to make their life better? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nJRab"&gt;We have this metric that is sort of a unique metric, I’m guessing. We call it JAW. It’s J-A-W. It stands for joy, awe and wonder. And If there’s a decision we’re trying to make about a new feature or a new direction of the product or even a different layout of the menu, we’ve think about will this bring joy, awe or wonder to the experience for that member experiencing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LstfX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things about Supernatural that strikes me is that it’s very similar to the first hit app on the Quest, Beat Saber. What is your relationship to Beat Saber and the other apps like that? Because the first time I ever put on a VR headset, someone’s like, “You’ve got to play Beat Saber.” Obviously Supernatural builds on the mechanic. You’ve extended it, but how do you see that relationship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMR2jq"&gt;I think we’re utilizing a mechanic that goes all the way back to Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero. There’s been many VR rhythm apps. I mean, the first one that we were looking at was actually Audioshield, which was a great workout in and of itself. I mean, moving your body to music, that you are striking things out of the air, is the rhythm game paradigm of virtual reality. It’s hugely effective if you’re going to try to get someone to have fun and have a cardio activity at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9sIO3"&gt;What we did with Supernatural was, we saw that works well. That is fun, but how do we build it from the ground up as a legitimate fitness system? Obviously, we have coaches. Our movements are designed to be healthy over repetitive use over long periods of time. We work with lots of different experts to make sure of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVgACm"&gt;Part of the education of discovery that we had, also, as a journey with the company was, in the earlier years, we were building a lot of these interactive music experiences. We were showing them at film festivals. Most people in the world haven’t seen them because we didn’t release them publicly on the app stores. But we’re building a lot of different sort of music-driven, cohabitated social experiences like we’ve been talking about, working with Pharrell, and OKGo, and Justice, and building these really cool, immersive, music-driven experiences where you’re moving your body and you’re inhabiting crazy, magical experiences. It’s sort of basically the evolution of music videos, going back to the early beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RrZ3f"&gt;What we saw with these experiences, though, as we were showing them at Sundance and Tribeca and South by [Southwest] and all those places was, people were coming out of them sweating profusely — which was the first problem that we had to solve because you’re putting a bunch of people in them in a row — and they were laughing. They were totally filled with joy. They routinely thought that they were in there for a shorter amount of time than they actually were. They’d do something for 15 minutes and think that they were in there for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwHgEV"&gt;I don’t know the last time you were on a treadmill and half an hour seemed like 15 minutes. It’s certainly never happened to me. We thought, in the process of thinking about how we use this technology for this other use case, that definitely went into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfFtCq"&gt;Also, a number of studies around your perception of discomfort is lowered in virtual reality, which is why they’re using it in clinical settings and in childbirth and burn centers and chemotherapy centers. There’s something about your perception being removed from your physical body in space that just makes stuff hurt less, but it also makes it easier to push yourself harder when you’re doing a cardio workout. It does hurt less and yes, it’s part of the fact that you’re basically playing a sport that is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07DGYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fitness is the killer use case for VR. It will be the first driving force of mass adoption through a normal consumer audience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2yvGS"&gt;There’s a major difference between being in a gym and a coach or instructor saying like, “Okay, we’re going to do 50 squats in a row. Here we go. Ready? One, two.” That experience is totally different than surfing and going into a tube and squatting and holding for 20 seconds while the barrel forms around you, but the physical benefit and activity is the same. You’re never in the tube going, “How long am I going to have to hold the squat for?” You’re just enjoying the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqFCsm"&gt;Taking these things that we learn through the entertainment experiences that we were making, and utilizing the fun mechanic of a beat game construct. Then pulling in all the resources and expertise of people that specialize in human movement and physical training, and then really building a system from the ground up to incorporate all those things for the best, most awesome, fitness experience that you can build in virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG9428"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the headsets for a minute. One of my theses with computers, I hope everyone forgives me, I just have a lot of ideas about computers generally, but computers that you put on your body, it seems like a killer app for all of them, whether it’s headsets or smartwatches or whatever, is health and fitness, right? The Apple Watch became an exponentially successful product when Apple shifted its focus to health and fitness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gNxLg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural is the thing that is getting a lot of people to buy a Quest and strap basically an Android computer on their face every day. Is there another killer app for the headset, for traditional VR headsets, like we have right now, that can drive adoption and get that installed base growing the way that everyone has always told me that it will? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f01rC"&gt;Yeah. I’ll say a couple things. I think what you’re saying is absolutely correct in terms of virtual reality; fitness is the killer use case for VR. It will be the first driving force of mass adoption through a normal consumer audience. Just as an example of what we’re seeing from our membership base, we’re 50/50 split, women and men, where, I think over 60 percent are over 40. This is not what a typical VR demographic looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4X0nY"&gt;The reason for that is, it’s using the technology for a different use case, and one that it works incredibly well for. When you think about going back to the technology of cinema, that was a linear sequence of still frames played one after another, not at first, but after not that long, sync sound went along with it. That technology, though, enabled the birth of cinema, but it also enables television, it also enables a Zoom call, it enables a how-to video that you’re watching on YouTube. It even enables a spreadsheet in Excel, that you’re moving numbers around. That technology of a linear sequence of still frames is what powers most of the things that we deal with on a daily basis on rectangles in our life, which there are many, as you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqfE66"&gt;That’s sort of like a case study, and where does the technology go once it’s used for one thing, and the answer is it essentially goes everywhere. What you’re seeing in virtual reality right now is very much what usually happens. I mean, the first thing being — Chris Dixon talks about it —  all new disruptive technologies first appear as though they are toys. Virtual reality is a perfect example of that, but it’s primarily understood to be a video game system right now. But when you take the technology and you apply it to exercise or wellness as we’re doing, it’s a totally different paradigm and it is one that many people are much more open and willing to adopt the technology, because it solves a problem in their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bl7L8k"&gt;Most people don’t buy new technologies just because they’re new technology. I do. Most people don’t. Most people buy new technology because it serves a purpose and it solves a problem in their life. You don’t buy a television set because you want a black rectangle on your wall. You buy it because your favorite television show comes through it. The new technology of virtual reality needs not just your favorite television show, but it needs all the other use cases that could be enabled by applying the technology to that use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE1BNA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about Within and Supernatural. How many employees does Within have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c85s8Z"&gt;It depends on if a few of them accepted an offer today, but we’re about 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQJ85Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many of them are focused on Supernatural itself? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFiM3"&gt;All of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcXoJ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Supernatural, the fitness platform, that’s your entire focus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPeX7U"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFGLbJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to make a Supernatural workout experience? Who is the staff that produces that all at once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QT1Ur5"&gt;There’s really two sides to our business, there’s the technology business and there’s a content business. [On the] technology side; all the multitude of complex systems that you might imagine to make something like an interactive, immersive VR and subscription platform work, from the sexy things like how the balls explode, to the less sexy things like back end account management — all of that requires a large engineering team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OfNA"&gt;Then, there’s the content side of it. There’s actually a few different pipelines that go into making the content. There’s the coach capture production pipeline, which is shooting the coaches and our 3D capture system that lives in Culver City. I should point out that we are, from a content standpoint, we are producing and launching new content every single day. That’s the flag we planted in the ground. When we launched, we said we’re going to launch a new workout a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlsbyw"&gt;Every morning, as you know, as a member, you open up the app on your iPhone or your Android phone, or you put the headset on, and there’s a new workout that has a new musical theme or sometimes it’s just sort of an overall theme, but it’s new every day. It’s a surprise under the Christmas tree of what the workout of the day is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDmcso"&gt;What goes into the content side of making that, the coach production pipeline, we’re shooting coaches five days a week to release classes, to release workouts every single day. There’s the environment pipeline, which is all the beautiful destinations that you’re finding yourself in, song to song, those are not just a flat 360 photo. That’s actually a 3D model with super high-res images mapped on top of the 3D model. That’s a pipeline that builds those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJlWdF"&gt;There is a mapping pipeline for the layout of the targets that are flying at you that are synced to music. That’s a team of trainers and choreographers that build the patterns of the targets and the placement of them that are synced to the music. We have a map-making tool that we built internally, that the mappers are actually in virtual reality and laying out the targets in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIHWw4"&gt;They can sort of forward the unit, they can reverse and play and stop and rewind the map over and over again as they physically place the targets in the air to go along with a picture. And they can see where the beats are up in space so they can line up the targets to the beat. That’s a very manual and creative process. It’s not an easy thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2i3i"&gt;We’re basically, essentially puppeteering your movements through what is essentially dance, to music that you love, and that involves a really talented person that can choreograph those movements. It feels, as you said, like you’re sort of, what was your terminology that you used at the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7KK14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My wife and I call it dance fighting. I mean you’re holding lightsabers and you’re dancing, so we just got there. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD2Kae"&gt;Yeah. There’s an element of sort of kung fu martial artness to it, but you’re also moving your body in choreographed ways to music. There’s also a hidden element of dance and moving your body to music is just naturally fun. So that’s the beat mapping pipeline and then there’s music curation and overall creative workout construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7smT8X"&gt;Every workout has a theme, has a playlist, has a creative thumbnail, has a creative name, has a description. There’s a creative content team that does all of that as well. We’re programming and thinking about workouts that are months ahead. We really put a lot of thought and care into making each of these workouts. It’s not just thrown together on the day, shoot it live, post it up. There’s a lot of curation and crafting and artistry from that team that really goes into making each one of those workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKHtfg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask what the cost curve is of that, and I’ll make the comparison to Peloton because it is such an easy comparison. Peloton, yeah, they have a bike and they have a software platform, and mostly though, they’re shooting videos of their trainers on a bike pedaling really hard and turning the resistance up and down. There’s some sensors and leaderboard stuff around it that makes that experience feel more interactive, but at the end of the day, it’s people on a bicycle and that’s what’s happening there. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYUimg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are describing a much more costly creative project, right? You had to build a software pipeline to do the choreography and the mapping, you have to build a software pipeline for volumetric 3D models of locations, you presumably have to acquire the photography and the imagery from all those far-flung locations you’re in. It’s just a lot of new things that are either at the top of the cost curve, or you have to invent them, which means you’re going up the cost curve. Do you see that coming down or is that the moat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h5Bspf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t actually look at our competition as a stationary bike. We look at our competition as the couch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0KFuR"&gt;It’s a little bit of both. The cost does come down as we get better at doing this and building more scalable systems, but it is what it takes to make something like this. By our estimates, the business model does pencil out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bX6pY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s good to hear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3zABz"&gt;Always good to hear, but we also, honestly, we think the market is a lot larger. There is a person that enjoys cardio exercise at home and takes joy from running on a treadmill or pedaling on a stationary bike. I, unfortunately, am not one of those people. By the way, God bless those people, I wish I was one of those people, but I think there’s a lot more people like me out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mx1z49"&gt;I mean, 50 percent of gym memberships go completely unused year to year. That’s people that have actually gotten up and gone to a gym and signed up, and just not used their membership. They just haven’t found the solution that works for them. We don’t actually look at our competition as a stationary bike. We look at our competition as the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1H2JCT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many members do you have right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e99qy"&gt;That’s a great question. We, of course, don’t broadcast our current membership-based numbers, but what I can say is that our goal for the first year was to have as many members as is reported that a large, well-known, connected fitness service had after their first year. We’re not at our first year yet, but it’s looking like we will have 10 times that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cIpm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large, well-known, connected fitness service. Is it the one I keep talking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tf3sTo"&gt;You can jump to your own conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31MlGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your churn like? It’s $19 a month. Are people signing up, paying the money and staying there? Are they trying it out and leaving? What does that life cycle look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awd59u"&gt;Yeah, our churn is low and comparable to other hardware-based connected fitness services. The thing that’s special about Supernatural honestly, is the cost of the hardware is like one-seventh of the cost of a spin cycle. We’re half the cost of a monthly subscription fee. I haven’t measured the volume of a spin cycle versus a VR headset, but probably like one-30th, one-50th the size of the thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8XUfF"&gt;We take up zero floor space. You put it in a drawer when you’re done, disappears, and you throw it in your suitcase and take it wherever you want to go. That’s really a different paradigm. Going back to the last question, I think it’s one that makes it a lot more accessible to a lot more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBxeMZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask one more question about the famous connected fitness company. Then, I actually do want to talk about headsets and platforms. Peloton, very famously in a big fight with the music industry, right? They don’t pay the fees the industry wants. They have a point of view about it. The music comes and goes. Peloton users are notoriously kind of angsty about it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG7uGt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural has the music. This year you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/business/9538423/vr-fitness-app-supernatural-umg-licensing-deal-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;made a deal with Universal Music Publishing Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and you have similar agreements with other labels, so there is a trove of popular music in the app to workout to. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHW8CT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that, Chris Milk has directed videos with Kanye West, he’s getting a deal? Is that you’ve structured a new kind of deal? Is that a cost that’s going to accelerate as you become more successful? How is that working, because it seems like one of the hardest challenges for all of these services right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71PJRi"&gt;Yeah, it’s definitely, it’s not an easy thing to do as a small startup. I will say that when we started building this, we knew that we needed the best music, that this just was not going to work using needle drop or stock music; that if you’re going to move your body to music, it needs to be music that you love. it needs to be music that you’re familiar with and that you’re passionate about, and it can’t be music that you’ve never heard before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZQCy"&gt;To do that requires relationships with a huge amount of large entities in the music business. The first thing that I did was call the people that I know, my old friends in the music industry from being a music video director, and said, “Listen, I know others have done this incorrectly. I want to do this right. I want to be a partner to your industry. I think there’s something that’s really special that we could build that is going to require some different type of creative thinking around deal structures and how we think about this platform in comparison to other platforms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyuJR9"&gt;That was on day one, I made those calls. It was a collaboration from the get-go. It was never feign ignorance and beg forgiveness later. It was definitely “We’re going to do this together and we’re going to do it the right way.” When you start working with the amount of music that we’re working with, there’s really not an off-the-shelf tool that allows you to do what you need to do, which involves ingesting the hundreds of thousands of songs from many different sources and keeping track of them and keeping track of the rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5erPk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, are you paying royalty rates based on plays? If I play one playlist versus another, you pay different royalty rates?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIPfOL"&gt;It’s really more complex than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlaXQ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJ9j1M"&gt;Yeah. We could do a whole show on how music deals work. It’s incredibly complicated and requires an entirely custom backend system to service it, but again, it’s what you have to do if you’re going to create the kind of system that Supernatural is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x34lxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I would compare that to the Spotify business model, where you pay Spotify some amount of money a month, they’ve just allocated some chunk of your subscription fee towards royalty payments, and then they have their own backend to allocate those further. Is that how you think about the $19 a month, that just some percentage of it is allocated towards music royalty payments? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrw2ty"&gt;Yeah, I mean, in the most general terms, when you see a piece of music in a movie, that’s a sync license and when you see music in Spotify or Apple Music, that’s a licensing deal. Every song that you might potentially play, it’s not just a deal with one entity. There might be a multitude of rights holders because you’ve got the record label, but then you also have the publisher, and you have to have both. The publisher, if you have a song that had 12 songwriters on it, you might have 12 different publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHOMfJ"&gt;You’ve got to make sure that every single thing that you’re playing is cleared and there’s nothing that just tells you like, here’s your list of songs that you’re good. It’s really, it’s complex to say the least, and it’s something that it’s taken really years to get to the point where it works as effectively as it does right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfJ9Jd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your license primarily a sync license to make a derivative work on the music or are you just licensing the track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssmoYk"&gt;What I can say is that we have the rights to hundreds of thousands of songs and that catalogue grows on a regular basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVT2l1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have some sort of like custom deal that you’ve worked out to enable this product? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M55mnB"&gt;I mean, there’s no off-the-shelf deal when it comes to music licensing. Everything is a custom negotiation across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1clVQC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s totally fair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2dFHx"&gt;It is a testament to the sort of openness and creative thinking of the music industry and how it thinks of service like Supernatural. Because it required a lot of creative thinking and constructive deal-making to make this whole thing work for everyone involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc0NvK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you had artists use it? Are they freaking out over it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NanMPT"&gt;Yeah. There’s a few.  There’s a number of artists that have used it. I won’t name anyone specifically, but there’s been artists that I’m friends with that are using this service that I have to notify tomorrow that they’re actually there in the service so they’re not surprised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkxwaW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s amazing. Are you going to do larger programming with artists, having them be coaches, having them talk to people? That seems like a real natural opportunity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osaXCx"&gt;Yeah, I mean, we would love to do more workouts that are specifically curated around specific artists. If you are a musical artist and you’re listening to this, and you’re excited about the future of fitness, get in touch with us. We’d love to do something cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx99DW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You got to cut me in. We’re talking music, I want a point too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZUFuQ"&gt;Yeah, right now we have a few workouts that are coming in the next couple months that are around specific musical artists. That’s just so cool because you can really go deep into their catalog and you can really tailor the whole experience from the places, the locations where you’re doing the workouts, to the voiceover and the theme and the art around it, specifically to that one artist. That’s something that we’re going into. It’s really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqaWzO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things about Supernatural that I think is really interesting is that it is very native to VR. It is an authentic product for VR. I have no idea how you would do a Supernatural workout in real life, like dodgeball. It’s a very complicated thing about how it would work in real life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OT0l9"&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ROJkS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That also limits your expansion capability, right? I keep hammering you with the Peloton comparison but Peloton was like, “We made a bike. We made a treadmill.” They’re going to make a rowing machine. They can do weightlifting. How do you expand your range of products when it’s all in the Quest and the Quest literally limits all the things you can do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnlIrk"&gt;Well, I mean, we also have an R&amp;amp;D lab at Within and Supernatural. I can say there’s a hell of a lot more things that we can do that are really compelling in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7wnsg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See, this is where you announce them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVwZN"&gt;I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcxSE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a perfect opportunity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkMrmJ"&gt;Perfect opportunity. I mean, I think that the limitation is really around not the hardware, because the hardware will come. If people have a use case for it and it solves a problem in their life, they’ll buy the hardware. I think the limitation is really having people understand that exercising in virtual reality makes sense. I mean, as I said at the beginning, it’s very hard to describe the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU3RO4"&gt;And I know this because I’ve described it thousands of times now and then had someone, I described it verbally and then they actually try it. Almost 100 percent of the time I describe it and they say, “Okay, I think I got it,” and then they try it and they go, “Yeah, that was not what I was imagining at all. That’s amazing, but not what I was imagining from the way that you describe it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btvzF6"&gt;I’ve sort of made peace with the fact that however I describe it, it’s never going to resonate in the same way as people actually experiencing it. But essentially, it’s a membership-based, full body, fitness and wellness service that utilizes the power of VR to make for a workout that you couldn’t experience otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJLOdx"&gt;The cooler way of describing it is, it’s home exercise. It feels like you’re playing a sport with your best friend while on vacation, but good luck getting anybody to totally imagine what that is going to be like when they put the headset on. But what’s cool is people are trying it and they’re telling other people in their immediate family or friends’ circle or social network circle that it’s working for them, and that is the sort of the network effect of people talking about it that it’s working for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFgVr7"&gt;It is, I understand, a strange thing to imagine. Like when you say a Quest is an Android phone that you strap onto your head, that does not sound like they’re paying for exercise, but when you do it, that’s not the experience that you’re having. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw6IQ0"&gt;The experience that you’re having is that you’re transported to the most beautiful places on Earth. You’re moving your body in this fun way, swinging bats through the air to hit these targets that are flying at you from 360 degrees along to your favorite music, and there’s like a coach that is your best friend that’s there with you and cheering you on the whole way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsUznV"&gt;That’s a totally different experience and one that you have to try. But I don’t think that we will be limited in the long term by the fact that it sounds counterintuitive, because there’s many things in our life that are also successful businesses that seem counterintuitive when you first hear about them, but then become commonplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxX14M"&gt;If I told you 10 years ago that you are going to hit a button on your phone and a stranger was going to pick you up outside a bar in his personal car and drive you home, that would sound strange and counterintuitive. If I told you that you’re going to rent your second bedroom out to a stranger that just flew in from someplace across the country and it was going to be totally fine, that would sound counterintuitive. There’s many things, at first, that sound counterintuitive but then when you try them you’re like, “Oh, actually, that makes a hell of a lot of sense.” I firmly believe that that’s going to be what happens with virtual reality and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTZCTq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The instructors are your best friends, right? They’re very personable. What we’ve seen with every fitness platform is the instructors become personalities. They go on to have extended personality-based careers in many cases. Is that how you’re thinking of your instructors too? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVZt4v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the one thing you maybe couldn’t do is, when the pandemic is over, go to a studio and be in the room with one of your instructors doing the workout, which seems, again, the VR workout is great because it’s in VR, but extending it to real life seems challenging in that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmXWYh"&gt;Yeah, well, I mean, I’ll put it this way; the things that are exercise that you can do in a gym are the things that make sense to physically do in the gym. It’s packing a bunch of people together in a four-walled room with a ceiling and an instructor, that one-to-many broadcast, and you do the things that you can do in that limited amount of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je68FQ"&gt;We’re creating a new reality. We’re not going to duplicate the things that we’re building. Yes, they don’t fit in a four-walled gym and, honestly, I think we’re all better for it. If we can create a reality where you can stand on top of a glacier in Iceland and slam targets with these space bats flying at you while Kendrick Lamar plays from the sky, I’ll take that over 20 people in a cement-walled room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHYtX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhRibs"&gt;But I think that there’s something to dig into here, which is that there’s entertainment and then there’s exercise. By exercise, I mean, specifically home exercise. Entertainment is something that you want to do because you enjoy doing it, right? You watch TV because you enjoy doing it. Exercise, for most of us, we do it for the long-term benefits. Most of us don’t enjoy the act of doing it, which is, as I said, why more than half of gym memberships are paid but don’t get used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67RwoI"&gt;I think what generation one, let’s call it “connected fitness”, has done brilliantly is take the home exercise experience and added a layer of entertainment on top of it. You have a personable coach or instructor that you feel their personality, you want to come back to another class of theirs. You’ve got incredible music and you’ve got the sense of a live feel, but the actual act of what you’re doing, let’s say it’s a virtual spin class, the actual act of pedaling in place is not intrinsically fun on its own. That layer of entertainment acts to distract you from the thing that you’re doing that is not fun on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icCjB5"&gt;I mean, we thought about, what if you could take entertainment and turn it into exercise? Now, that exists in real life. It’s called sports. They take place outside. They require equipment. Sometimes other people then oftentimes travel to other places, like skiing, snowboarding, mountain bike riding, basketball, hiking. These are things that you do that are exercise but you’re not, I mean, you may do them for the exercise benefit of them, but you are also doing them because they are intrinsically fun on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mANz9Z"&gt;It’s very hard to create something, create a modality that is intrinsically fun from an exercise standpoint in your house, just because you have what you’re dealing with in your house, which is a limited amount of space. Mountain biking does not fit in your bedroom. Skiing does not fit in your living room, but what if they could? And that’s what we set out to build, something that was intrinsically fun, intrinsically entertainment, and something you wanted to do over and over again that had the extra benefit of exercise because that’s the thing that makes it easy to keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNdD3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I asked about going into the real world in the context of our platform conversation, is it seems like it would be really fun to do Supernatural with another person. It’d be really fun to do it in a class setting, maybe on a beach, and the platform that would enable that would be an AR platform, an augmented reality platform. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxAmNS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those are not quite here yet. There’s lots of prototype E or early versions of those products. The AR versus VR conversation just seems to rage all the time. Is that something that you have a position on? Is it something you’re looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Olw6Oi"&gt;Yeah, I’m very much looking forward to more robust AR systems coming into the market. I think there’s totally room to explore that technology for a similar purpose as well, but I would challenge you a little bit, because yes, it would be cool to be on the beach with your friend doing Supernatural together but it’s also possible, for you and your friend, to be on a beach and doing Supernatural together but you’re both in your bedrooms, in your apartments, and you didn’t have to travel to a beach to do it, which is a lot more realistic and feasible for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZRDXQ"&gt;Going back to what I was saying before about the potential for shared experiences inside of virtual reality, where the two people inside of the virtual world together are in two completely different geographical locations in real life, is here today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whYdon"&gt;It’s not widely utilized, but what it does allow for is for you to have more meaningful relationships with the people that are geographically removed from you, which, of course, at the moment is sort of everyone’s reality, but imagine rolling out of bed and working out with your best friend every morning that lives in San Diego and you live in San Francisco, and you can do that together and feel like you are on that beach together.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2cDlb"&gt;That’s totally possible. I would argue that that’s more exciting than having to both travel to a beach to meet each other together because it’s something you can do sometimes, but certainly not like every morning before you go to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDE3Fb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s fair, although I would say a lot of people right now are very eager to travel somewhere with some people. Now, I have to ask you, is that on the roadmap, doing a workout with somebody else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="622X5A"&gt;I would put it like this, the possibilities of what we can do and the ideas for what we’d like to do, like our appetite’s, what’s the expression? Our appetite is bigger than...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxjhV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSzUfa"&gt;Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Yeah, I mean, my eyes for what we could do, is limited by just how much you can build if you’re going to build a reliable system that has a lot of people on it. You, of course, have the people that you have, you have the financing that you have, you have the runway that you have, and you prioritize the things that you think will make the most meaningful difference for the people on the platform. That’s certainly what we’re doing and of course, that sort of shared workout experience is something that we’d love to do and is actively being considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqu4y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for Supernatural? What should people be looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SVKsF"&gt;What should people be looking forward to? We really want to push the envelope of not just how do we translate existing things that you could do inside of a gym into virtual reality, we want to build things that have the same health benefits, but reimagine them in ways that are fun and invigorating and awe-inspiring and joyful and bring you to another place and sort of another reality of possibility. Like I said, we’re not in a four-walled gym. We can put you anywhere and we can make things that are physically impossible, like explosive cannon balls flying at you from all directions. It’s just not something that we’re going to set up in the parking lot of your local gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DU5ohj"&gt;Really, continuing to follow that thread of how can we make people’s lives better from the experiences that they’re having inside of VR. That’s a big thing for us. We’re not trying to make a world where everybody wakes up and goes into their VR headset and disconnects from society and gets their embryonic fluid Matrix pod and checks out for the day. That’s not what we’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AON70n"&gt;We have an OKR [objective and key results] in the company called MLB, which is “Make Life Better,” and we measure, are we making our members’ lives better outside of VR from the experiences that they’re having inside of Supernatural inside of VR. It’s definitely something that we see happening. We have a Facebook group that a huge amount of our members are on and they are incredible and they’re on a regular basis talking about their experiences publicly. You see it over and over again, people talking about how they haven’t worked out in decades or they’ve never worked out, and they’ve discovered the act of exercise through Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WWMHQX"&gt;Supernatural sort of unlocked, not just exercise for them, but the idea that they could live a healthy lifestyle. You see people that are posting about how their doctor just told them that they no longer need to take their diabetes medication and this is someone that hasn’t worked out in 40 years but from working out for a few months, they started transforming their physicality and in the course of that, they also started eating healthy because they’re saying to themselves, “Well, if I’m going to work out, I should probably change my diet, too.” And they do. That’s a really awesome, magical thing and I think it speaks to the larger untapped audience that is out there that have chosen no solution rather than one of the current sets of solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s XPS 13 now comes with an OLED touch display option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 seen from the left side on a white background. The screen displays a blue, white, and orange marbled pattern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFmOrwt6fk4CLHmRnsunZi6e1dw=/0x667:4000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117972/XPS_13_black_open_up_right.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9vxpg"&gt;Dell has unveiled a new XPS 13 option with an OLED touchscreen that is available for purchase today. The feature will cost an extra $300 over FHD models. (Note: This isn’t a brand-new XPS. It’s just an OLED version of the 9310 that came out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;

They can be equipped with up to an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iYn1MQ"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is consistently one of the best 13-inch laptops you can buy. It’s currently number six on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; list, and I had very few complaints in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;most recent review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. It has an excellent, spacious 16:10 display; a solid keyboard and touchpad; great battery life; a compact chassis; and some of the best performance you can find in a 13-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three XPS 13 models in a row on a white background. The far left is in reverse clamshell mode, the middle is in clamshell mode, the far right is in tent mode.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bWpUNe"&gt;You can currently configure the XPS 13 with a 3840 x 2400 touch display, a 1920 x 1200 touch display, or a regular 1920 x 1200 non-touch panel. The new OLED touch model will have 3456 x 2160 resolution (3.5K). Dell says it will reach 400 nits of brightness and will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what Dell calls the “Inspiron Family”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8HEDt"&gt;Dell also announced a number of new additions to its lower-priced Inspiron line. These include an Inspiron 14 2-in-1 that will support both Intel 11th-Gen and AMD Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, and Inspiron 16 Plus workstation with a 3K 16:10 display. The Inpsiron 14 2-in-1 will be available in North America on May 4th starting at $729; the Inspiron 16 Plus hits shelves on June 3rd starting at $949.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Car Thing debuts as a limited release for selected US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sqaaL9QydBrJJOYYnx_UxcjfEb0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117941/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bjlbEQ"&gt;Spotify’s first gadget has landed. Car Thing, a Spotify-only, voice-controlled device for the car, is launching today in limited quantities to invited users. It’s a dedicated, Bluetooth-connected device for controlling Spotify without the need for a phone screen, which seems to be meant for people who drive older cars without built-in infotainment systems or phone connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyIpHa"&gt;Before getting to the device details, let’s focus on the basics. Car Thing is only being released as a “limited product launch,” so you can’t buy one outright. Instead, you can sign up for the waitlist and hope Spotify reaches out. It’s only available for US customers, and you have to subscribe to Spotify Premium to qualify. Another thing to know: if you’re chosen to try Car Thing, the device is free, but you have to pay for shipping. Spotify declined to comment on how many units it’d be giving away. The company’s also billing the gadget as an “exploration,” so it’s unclear how serious the team is about the product and its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFRXRu"&gt;The device is shockingly small and lightweight. It has a thin profile and features two prominent buttons on the front, a small one that serves as a back button and a larger knob that lets you interact with whatever’s on-screen. There’s no speaker, so it’s easiest to think of the device as, essentially, a Spotify remote. Yes, you could use your actual phone to play Spotify content, but instead, Spotify is betting that you’ll want voice controls and a dedicated interface to control your audio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWoADpL3fcPfdIfxGRp4RFko9XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439536/acarman_20210412_4524_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joE5nQ"&gt;I’ve tested Car Thing for a couple days and found the voice controls to be easy to use and relatively intuitive. I drive a 2009 Honda Fit and already keep my phone mounted to the dash for navigation, so I ended up mounting the Car Thing on my vent. This meant I had two bright screens facing me throughout my drive. (I do have a screen built into my car, which you’ll see in photos, but I don’t use it for anything because I prefer Google Maps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6X6DhP"&gt;The voice controls mostly worked — for some reason it only got tripped up on a Kid Cudi request — but I grew frustrated with the steps it took to control music. When a song that I didn’t like played, it took longer to say, “Hey Spotify, skip” than it would have to just tap the skip button on my phone. I generally felt like I could more efficiently navigate Spotify just by using my phone at stop lights. The device &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shine, however, when you ask the voice assistant to start a playlist, and it registered those commands easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCivWu"&gt;As for the hardware itself, Car Thing pairs with a phone over Bluetooth. It needs this phone for a data connection, so yes, users will require a decent amount of data to stream. In a press briefing, Spotify noted that right now, there’s no way for users to pull only from their downloaded content, although that functionality could come in the future. Depending on a car’s connectivity, users can either rely on an auxiliary cable for sound or keep their phone paired to their car’s Bluetooth to play audio content over the speakers. The Car Thing doesn’t have a speaker itself, and it’s basically controlling the Spotify app on your phone. It’s a strange setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4KtAF"&gt;The device comes with a 12V adapter into which you’ll plug the provided USB-A to USB-C cable. Car Thing does not include a rechargeable battery and needs to be plugged in at all times. The device also ships with three different mounts: a vent mount, a dashboard mount, and a CD player mount. You can clip a magnetic attachment to these mounts, which then lets you take the Car Thing off easily. (Also worth noting is that the dash mount doesn’t come with a suction cup and instead requires that you stick it to your dash with 3M adhesive backing.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFfou4ECRJysy5XRDzDYq5t89hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439218/carthing1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TueaCX"&gt;Once mounted, you can interact with Car Thing in three ways: through your voice using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371866/hey-spotify-voice-assistant-hands-free-android-ios-iphone"&gt;“Hey Spotify” command&lt;/a&gt;, through its tactile buttons and knob, or through its touchscreen. It also features four preset buttons on the top of the device, which you can set to specific content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQCo51"&gt;Now that I have a Car Thing, can I see it being a success? I guess it depends on how comfortable people are with a Spotify-owned microphone in their cars and whether they think the device offers a more meaningful experience than their built-in infotainment systems. Because my car is older, it did provide a hands-free interface for music while also adding another screen to my setup. But I also feel uneasy about a Spotify microphone being within earshot of all my conversations. (The device does feature a digital setting to turn the microphone off, probably to address concerns like mine, but still.) Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/"&gt;voice privacy page&lt;/a&gt; says it only records and stores what users say after its “Hey Spotify” wake phrase is spoken, but I still don’t love the idea of an always-listening microphone near me. The privacy page mostly details the company’s interactive voice ads, which I have yet to come across. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7I7saQ"&gt;Broadly, I’d assume people with modern infotainment systems likely won’t need or want a Spotify-only Bluetooth remote, whereas people like me, whose cars are older, might end up wanting to stick with whatever system they’ve already figured out. One thing that Spotify might accomplish with Car Thing, however, is getting users who default to the radio to switch to Spotify instead. It’s clearly making a play for the space with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662060/spotify-your-daily-drive-playlist-update"&gt;Your Daily Drive playlist&lt;/a&gt;, which updates daily with music and spoken word content, as well as its push into podcasts. I default to the radio often because it’s the easiest thing to put on. Car Thing, if I keep it in my car, would admittedly change that and give Spotify more of my listening time, and that’s likely all Spotify wants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple gets its own button on Roku’s latest remotes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gtyw4JxcT6EHHHzvYex34ZSV1U=/0x0:1322x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117927/AppleRoku.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5JRzh"&gt;In a sign of how far Apple is willing to go to continue raising the profile of Apple TV Plus, the company has worked out a deal with Roku that will give the streaming video service its own shortcut button. This is the first time a branded Apple TV Plus button has appeared on any remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvqn71"&gt;You’ll find it on the new Roku Voice Remote Pro, announced today, which features a rechargeable battery, headphone jack for private listening, and two programmable shortcut buttons. The usual branded buttons include Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and now Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHW1EG"&gt;The Apple TV Plus button will also be on the remotes that accompany the new Roku Express 4K Plus and Roku Streambar Pro. Those &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have the two customizable buttons, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9ozEdh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Netflix button is an advertisement masquerading as a product ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="20vhKQ"&gt;Roku is believed to charge a hefty fee for such prime real estate on its remote controls. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-11/streaming-box-king-roku-is-under-seige-from-amazon-and-apple"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; it basically works out to $1 per customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqqB67"&gt;But Roku has also taken steps in recent months to assuage Apple users: last year, the company added Apple’s AirPlay 2 to its Roku OS software on most 4K-capable streaming products. Now Roku says it will expand that rollout to include HD Roku devices. This makes Roku’s devices a tempting, much less expensive alternative to Apple’s Apple TV hardware, and it’s also a leg up over Amazon Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast, neither of which support AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku announces Express 4K Plus streaming player and rechargeable Voice Remote Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KASLmgETC6Vn9kmWPlNy5KZmEdo=/0x55:1292x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117949/rokuexpress4kplus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDBmgh"&gt;Roku’s introducing a trio of new devices today, led by the new $39.99 Express 4K Plus streaming device. Shipping in mid-May, the Express 4K Plus basically replaces the Roku Premiere as the company’s entry-level 4K player. It now has a faster processor, dual-band Wi-Fi, and increased internal storage. Plus, Roku says you can now attach a Micro-USB-to-Ethernet adapter if you prefer a wired connection. The Express 4K Plus is also the first Roku player to support HDR10+, which will come to the Roku Ultra as well after a future firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH3dmD"&gt;A stripped-down “Express 4K” player will be sold exclusively at Walmart in the US for $35. This model will also make its way to Canada, Mexico, and the UK. The only real difference is that it ships with a basic Roku remote instead of the voice remote that comes with the Plus SKU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSvIS"&gt;Next up is the first Roku remote with a rechargeable built-in battery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284484/roku-rechargeable-remote-testing-early-access-micro-usb"&gt;We knew this one was coming&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll be able to buy the Roku Voice Remote Pro starting today for $29.99. It includes a built-in headphone jack for private audio, two customizable shortcut buttons, TV controls, and, in another first for Roku, it features mid-field microphones for hands-free voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl6y8HMpdbN0QIdRd0csq1H6TGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440073/RokuVoicePro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QvuvNa"&gt;By default, the mics will listen for the “Hey Roku” hot phrase. But there’s a slider button right on the remote that turns off the always-listening mode. (If you do so, you can still hold down the microphone button on the front of the remote and speak a command.) One reason for maybe leaving the mics on? You can call out to the remote with a “Hey Roku, find my remote,” and it’ll make a sound to reveal its location in the couch cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SZIcqLg0jTk98F5hduhYXKk6rY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440102/StreambarPro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LTqGUl"&gt;And the last of the new Roku products is what the company is calling its Streambar Pro, described as “an evolution of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848492/roku-smart-soundbar-wireless-subwoofer-speakers-tv-setup-ifa-2019"&gt;the Roku Smart Soundbar.&lt;/a&gt;” The Smart Soundbar came with Roku’s streaming software built in, and this refreshed hardware “now includes a Roku voice remote with personal shortcut buttons and private listening, Roku headphones, and the new virtual surround feature for $179.99.” (Virtual surround will also come to the Smart Soundbar with a software update.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrh2ev"&gt;The Streambar Pro will be available to order from Roku’s website in late May and should start arriving at major retailers in June. Roku still doesn’t face any real competition from Amazon in this combined soundbar / streaming player category, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;Apple is rumored to be experimenting with a product&lt;/a&gt; similar in concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrgSy8"&gt;Roku’s player lineup now consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DZ7F9S"&gt;Roku Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HIQle6"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZjJHLT"&gt;Roku Express 4K Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I1ui0G"&gt;Roku Express&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jgiigg"&gt;Roku Streambar Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ctrNZz"&gt;Roku Streambar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4_Xv0XRhkuvSkk-CQyOPpFwaHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440105/PLAYER_LINEUP.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prz13amLb5o4RIUN9G_34gMS_NU=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118013/Surface_Laptop_4___11.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop 4.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZxAcoP"&gt;Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCSpgw"&gt;The difference in pricing likely comes down to the fact that Microsoft isn’t using AMD’s latest 5000 series CPUs here. Instead, Microsoft is using AMD’s Zen 2-based chips for its AMD Ryzen Surface Edition processors. Despite this, performance between the Intel and AMD versions could be rather similar, but we’ll have to wait for full reviews to judge how Microsoft’s choices have landed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMZj_oKUDzqarEmoq_x4vji93GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440392/Surface_Laptop_4_Family.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A6qTn7"&gt;These processor improvements allow Microsoft to promise up to 70 percent more performance over the Surface Laptop 3, and some (on paper) battery life gains. Microsoft is promising up to 19 hours of battery life on the 13.5-inch AMD model and up to 17.5 hours on the 15-inch version. The Intel-powered 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 4 is rated up to 17 hours of battery life, while the larger 15-inch model hits 16.5 hours. Both of the Intel versions will also ship with Intel’s latest Iris Xe graphics, which means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;games like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; will be playable at 1080p ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ra0ObW"&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 also maintains the same design of the Surface Laptop 3 that shipped in 2019. You’ll be able to pick between the classic platinum Surface style and a new ice blue color on the 13.5-inch models, both of which are Alcantara fabric. Matte black and sandstone are also available in metal options for the 13.5-inch models, while the 15-inch versions are strictly platinum and matte black in metal and no Alcantara fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 in ice blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SHmJgE"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t really updated the rest of the Surface Laptop 4, though. There’s a single USB-C port, one USB-A port, a headphone jack, and Microsoft’s Surface Connect port for charging. There’s still no Thunderbolt support, and the M.2 NVMe SSD is still removable from a slot at the rear of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZeTd9"&gt;As a result of the choice between AMD or Intel, the Surface Laptop 4 lineup is pretty complicated this time around. The 13.5-inch base model at $999 is the AMD Ryzen 5 4680U, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Intel base model is the 11th Gen Core i5 1135G7, with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There will also be a variety of Intel models all the way up to the $2,299 version with a Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. A second AMD model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will ship around eight weeks after launch for $1,199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvYy2b"&gt;Over on the 15-inch side, there are more AMD options starting with the $1,299 AMD Ryzen 7 4980U model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. You can configure this up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,699. The Intel 15-inch models start at $1,799 for the Core i7 1185G7 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, or there’s the option for 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $2,399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces new webcam and USB-C speaker for the work from home era</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CS8EXXrrjuLpu3j9t4psoDywV64=/0x0:2379x1586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117951/microsoftmodernwebcam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Modern Webcam and USB-C Speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEnwTS"&gt;Microsoft’s long-awaited new webcam is finally here, alongside a number of accessories designed for the work from home era. Rumors of a new Microsoft webcam have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322831/microsoft-surface-webcams-spring-2021-release-rumors"&gt;circulating for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the result is what Microsoft calls the Modern Webcam. It’s a fairly basic and affordable 1080p webcam that will start shipping for $69.99 in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsykc1"&gt;The Microsoft Modern Webcam will support up to 1080p HDR output at 30fps and connects via USB-A, not USB-C. It’s not the 4K webcam found on Microsoft’s Surface Hub 2, and it doesn’t include Windows Hello support either. It’s really a simple webcam designed for students or workers to quickly add a better video calling option to an existing laptop or PC. Microsoft is also including a privacy shutter and LED indicator to let people easily see when the webcam is active.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou-yC9d-e1sBrLiRJjCQZj0e-oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440419/microsoftmodernusbcspeaker.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Modern USB-C Speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BQzlUY"&gt;Microsoft is also launching a new USB-C speaker. The Modern USB-C Speaker is designed primarily for Microsoft Teams, and it even includes a button to launch a control panel for Teams with quick actions for meetings. Microsoft’s USB-C speaker includes omni-directional microphones and background noise cancellation to improve audio quality. There are also the usual mute, volume, and call-button controls on the top deck of the dark fabric design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgrczi"&gt;It’s a compact speaker that’s just five inches wide, with cable storage for the USB-C connection and even a carrying case for protection when moving it around. While it’s designed primarily for meetings, you’ll be able to output any audio out of the speaker so it should be fine for music, too. Microsoft’s USB-C speaker will be available in June priced at $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="622fHk"&gt;Microsoft is also launching new USB and wireless headsets, as well as Surface Headphones 2 Plus today. All three devices include a Microsoft Teams button, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22145483"&gt;read more about them right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new headsets and Surface headphones have Microsoft Teams buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/981rlbppns0YtAwJ6n6bC6FE3Eg=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117940/microsoftnewheadsets.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new headsets for 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microosft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXxUw2"&gt;Microsoft is launching Surface Headphones 2 Plus today alongside two new headsets, all with dedicated Microsoft Teams buttons. It’s Microsoft’s latest hardware attempt to push Microsoft Teams, after the company launched new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308962/microsoft-intelligent-speaker-teams-translation-transcription-features"&gt;intelligent speakers for Teams last month&lt;/a&gt; and monitors started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22214786/dell-monitor-microsoft-teams-button-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;appearing with Teams buttons&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. These aren’t the only headsets to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242753/microsoft-teams-headphones-button-launch-app-certified-devices-upgrade"&gt;feature a Microsoft Teams button&lt;/a&gt;, but now Microsoft’s trying to make it the new norm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCDTF6"&gt;First up is Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 Plus for Business. Much like the Plus moniker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, this is more of a refresh than a major redesign. All of the same features on the Surface Headphones 2, including battery life, remain the same, but Microsoft is now certifying these headphones for Teams usage. That means there’s a dedicated Microsoft Teams button and a new USB dongle that includes a light to let you know whether you’re on mute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD0uuvcked78hIf3VkgnQYYLD-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440440/surfacephones2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Headphones 2 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmX-on3cxeWvk__xGCbrog9EKxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440450/surfacephonesdongle.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Headphones 2 Plus dongle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yDH9hd"&gt;As the name implies, Microsoft is only selling the Surface Headphones 2 Plus for Business (what a mouthful) to business and education customers. The headphones will only be available in a black color option for $299.99 starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNxdAR"&gt;Alongside the Surface-branded headphones, Microsoft is also launching two new headsets with dedicated Microsoft Teams buttons. After launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;impressive Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; last month, Microsoft’s new Modern Wireless Headset offers a somewhat similar option for laptops and PCs. This wireless headset includes padded ear cups, a microphone that automatically mutes when you flip it up, and on-ear controls for mute, volume, and Teams controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWKXKvcVMbBxEryiDEUIPuY1aXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440442/microsoftwirelessheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Modern Wireless Headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncVCi-_OwGYZ4lUFCY1j05QtQsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440443/microsoftmodernusbheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Modern USB Headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LwPLib"&gt;While the headset includes Bluetooth support, it will require the included USB-A dongle for the Microsoft Teams features. Microsoft is promising up to 50 hours of music listening on this Modern Wireless Headset, or up to 30 hours of Microsoft Teams talk time. The headset can be charged fully in two and a half hours. Microsoft isn’t releasing pricing for the Modern Wireless Headset yet, but the company says it will ship in select markets this June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9wj9q"&gt;If you’re not interested in wireless, then there’s the Microsoft Modern USB Headset. Despite the modern name, it connects over USB-A, not USB-C, and includes in-line controls for volume, mute, and the Microsoft Teams button. It’s mostly a lightweight headset with padded ear cups that’s designed to be a somewhat affordable Microsoft Teams headset for $49.99. This headset will ship in June for business and education customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku OS 10 adds instant resume for streaming apps, brings AirPlay 2 to more devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBKMCCJweyxvp5fmPNgguzAa-Wc=/0x10:1416x954/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117926/rokuos.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5koUQ"&gt;Roku today announced that its latest software release, Roku OS 10, has begun rolling out and will start making its way to all supported devices in the coming weeks. “Roku OS 10 introduces a variety of new features getting users to content faster, improving network and input configurations, offering new ways to customize the experience and performance enhancements,” the company said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqaKqW"&gt;The first new feature of Roku OS 10 is instant resume: now, streaming apps can pick up from where they left off when you last exited them. This seems to require some work on the developer’s part, as only a few apps (including the Roku Channel) are offering instant resume out of the gate — but none of the huge players like Netflix or Prime Video are supporting it yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKseiV"&gt;Next is what Roku calls “automatic Wi-Fi detection.” If you’ve got separate Wi-Fi networks in your home for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, a Roku device will now recommend the better option at setup. And if there’s any buffering or other stream interruptions, you might see a prompt appear recommending that you jump over to the other, less congested network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIgnRt"&gt;Roku is also adding automatic game console configuration. Starting with Roku OS 10, when you plug a console into a Roku TV, the tile will change to the right name and the Roku TV will enter game mode. “Depending on the Roku TV model being used, settings that get automatically configured may include HDR gaming, auto low latency mode (ALLM), variable refresh rate (VRR), high frame rate, and THX certified game mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tVgrp"&gt;AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support will be extended to more devices with the launch of Roku OS 10. Before, these Apple features came to 4K-compatible Roku products and 4K Roku TVs, but now the company says they’ll both now be available “on HD Roku streaming devices, such as the Roku Express, and select HD Roku TV models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZoHI4"&gt;Roku OS 10 lets you customize the live TV channel guide if you’ve got an antenna plugged into your Roku TV. And it also introduces support for HDR10+ on the Roku Ultra and new Roku Express 4K Plus. It also adds virtual surround sound to the Roku Smart Soundbar and new Roku Streambar Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is testing a video speed-dating app called Sparked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Te7JvImXwg9uoiuU4-95JE5ZwVA=/90x0:1394x869/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117906/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_8.44.29_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v981Cd"&gt;Facebook is testing a video speed dating app called Sparked. The app, which requires a Facebook profile to create an account, is developed by the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687760/facebook-experimental-apps-npe-team-label-launch-ios-android-web"&gt;NPE Team&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s in-house group that works on experimental apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogig4A"&gt;You can view the Sparked webpage &lt;a href="https://www.sparkedapp.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where it describes the app as “video dating with kind people.” It also promises no public profiles, no swiping, no DMs, and that it’s free to use. The app will seemingly cycle people through speed video dates that last four minutes. It’s unclear how many video dates a person will go on per event, but the app says that if “you both have a great time” daters will then be scheduled for a 10-minute second date. After that point, Sparked suggests they can exchange contact information and stay in touch through Instagram, iMessage, or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ggwyT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; attempted to set up a profile and was put on a waitlist, but the user sign-up flow suggests kindness is a key theme for the app. When signing up, users have to type out what makes them a kind dater. The app says these responses will be “reviewed by a human at Sparked” before people can go on speed dates. Users also have to choose whether they want to date men, women, or non-binary people, and then are asked if they are open to dating trans people. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; viewed a &lt;a href="https://sparkedapp.com/?eventID=146673194047578"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for a dating event in Chicago that says 47 people have signed up to attend. What’s unclear is how daters connect to the event, like whether they have to log into Sparked through the web, or if they’ll eventually be prompted to download an app. No app is live in the App Store or Google Play. (We went through this sign-up process just from a browser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVdqfX"&gt;We’ve reached out to Facebook for more details and will update if we hear back. You can view screenshots of the sign-up process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lqrJZF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10443792"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xw9HkB"&gt;Sparked would be the second dating product from Facebook. Facebook Dating, which operates out of the main Facebook app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850307/facebook-dating-united-states-launch"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and has since rolled out to various countries, including, most recently, the UK. It operates similarly to most dating apps in that people can view a public profile of a potential match and then send a like to possibly receive one back and start a conversation. The NPE Team &lt;a href="https://npe.fb.com/"&gt;has launched&lt;/a&gt; many apps, none of which have particularly taken off, so it’s unclear how committed Facebook will be to Sparked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEQPUl"&gt;Video dating only recently became a popular idea, mostly spurred by the pandemic and people staying at home and limiting their in-person interactions. The League first launched a video speed dating feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20967166/the-league-live-video-dating-app-launch"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21209801/hinge-video-call-chat-date-from-home-feature-launch"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248548/tinder-video-chat-launch-update"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; have also launched the ability for people to have video chats with matches. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19121374/bumble-dating-app-video-voice-chat-call-first-date"&gt;Bumble&lt;/a&gt; launched its video chat function in 2019, as well.) Sparked would mirror The League’s approach and seems to suggest that the company is experimenting with new ways to get people to date as they get sick of swiping and filtering through hundreds of profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
