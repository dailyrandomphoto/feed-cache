    <title>Microsoft to fix Windows 10 bug that can corrupt a hard drive just by looking at an icon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWqTcuDpF2oIp3kUrvkvUYwvOG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672420/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUYri7"&gt;Microsoft says it’s planning to fix a bizarre Windows 10 bug that could corrupt a hard drive just by looking at an icon. Security researcher Jonas L &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonasLyk/status/1347900440000811010"&gt;first warned&lt;/a&gt; about the bug earlier  this week, describing it as a “nasty vulnerability.” Attackers can hide a specially crafted line inside a ZIP file, folder, or even a simple Windows shortcut. All a Windows 10 user needs to do is extract the ZIP file or simply look at a folder that contains a malicious shortcut and it will automatically trigger hard drive corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR3OJs"&gt;Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst at the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1347958161609809921"&gt;confirmed the findings&lt;/a&gt;, and notes that there could be more ways to trigger the NTFS corruption.  Dormann also revealed the vulnerability has existed in Windows 10 for nearly three years, and that he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1347995994508693504"&gt;reported another NTFS issue&lt;/a&gt; two years ago that still hasn’t been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQpHsN"&gt;“We are aware of this issue and will provide an update in a future release,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The use of this technique relies on social engineering and as always we encourage our customers to practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nNH7iJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seems like it can also be triggered when you paste the command in the URL of a browser except ie so far &lt;a href="https://t.co/7XsGhrowps"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7XsGhrowps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Siam Alam (@Slmi0xC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slmi0xC/status/1349983599865466881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xzw3dM"&gt;Others have found that the vulnerability also occurs if you simply paste the offending string into the address bar in a browser. &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-bug-corrupts-your-hard-drive-on-seeing-this-files-icon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;has also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; the bug in a variety of different ways, and notes that it will prompt Windows 10 users to reboot a PC to repair the corrupted disk records. The reboot will trigger the Windows chkdsk process, which should successfully repair the corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mKNnG"&gt;The repair process isn’t always automatic, though. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1349905649703022594"&gt;Dormann says&lt;/a&gt; it may require manual intervention to successfully repair the corrupted disk records. The bug also doesn’t require admin rights to trigger or special write permissions. That could make it more problematic for IT admins if chkdsk fails to automatically repair affected drives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zocdoc offers COVID-19 vaccine scheduler to health care organizations  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Opens Javits Convention Center As Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCi2hS76Gjsr1-APGrL-OSuGHkE=/0x2:6644x4431/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672340/1296201464.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zmwf36"&gt;Medical appointment company Zocdoc is offering to handle COVID-19 vaccine scheduling logistics for hospitals and health systems, many of which have spent the early days of the vaccine rollout struggling to handle the crush of demand for doses. Mount Sinai Health System in New York has been using the company’s tool to handle vaccine appointments since mid-December, and has scheduled over 100,000 appointments since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDxmxH"&gt;“It’s for anyone who’s in the front lines of administering COVID-19 vaccinations, to streamline their work. That’s our contribution to the public health effort,” Oliver Kharraz, CEO and founder of Zocdoc, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The scheduler is free for any group offering vaccines, even if they aren’t Zocdoc clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBq3Tj"&gt;Without federal coordination, state and local public health departments have been left to coordinate vaccine appointments on their own, often with limited resources. Many makeshift digital platforms across the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/vaccine-registration-sites-are-opening-across-the-country-and-filling-up-in-minutes.html"&gt;crashed&lt;/a&gt; or locked people out after thousands scrambled to sign up at once. “It’s one of these things that looks deceptively simple, but it’s deceptively hard to do,” Kharraz says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APS9wy"&gt;The Zocdoc Vaccine Scheduler can slot into an organization’s website to screen patients and book appointments, while shouldering high traffic demands. At its peak, the Zocdoc-run Mount Sinai scheduler was booking 100 appointments per minute, a traffic volume that could overwhelm a system that wasn’t accustomed to that load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OygjPN"&gt;Online tools some health departments and hospitals use to schedule vaccine appointments are also complex, requiring users to navigate multiple input fields or upload attachments. They’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;difficult for older adults&lt;/a&gt; who are eligible for vaccinations to navigate. Zocdoc is used by millions of seniors on Medicare, Kharraz says, so he’s confident the user interface would be accessible to that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Li0xk"&gt;Zocdoc says it is in discussions with multiple health care organizations and health departments about the scheduler. The team is also working with cities to set up centralized clearinghouses for all their local vaccination sites. In New York City, one challenge has been that there isn’t a single appointment scheduler that integrates every site. People looking for slots have to jump from website to website, and from interface to interface. Kharraz says that Zocdoc could integrate them all together. “It’s just pointless to be going from A to B checking what’s currently available,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbPVDu"&gt;Organizations other than Mount Sinai will start to go live with the tool next week, Kharraz says. “Our goal is to have really national coverage for this,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2hVGb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaNk0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to cancel your account at Netflix, Amazon Prime, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple TV Hulu Plus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LAoTontXny1CbzxU3RJXUwAY0Y=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672182/IMG_9379.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jcHElm"&gt;Let’s face it: some of us are so busy these days — what with pandemics and presidential elections and attempted overthrows of the government — that we don’t pay enough attention to what we are subscribed to (and paying for). Especially now, when there are more and more streaming services vying for our attention, it’s easy to go for a trial subscription, or to decide that you’re going to subscribe “just for a couple of months,” and then completely forget about it. Meanwhile, your charge card is being pinged every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsPHRR"&gt;For example, Matthew Inman, the artist who creates the comics site &lt;a href="https://theoatmeal.com/"&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, recently reported (to his apparent chagrin), that he had been paying for Netflix’s DVD subscription for the last 13 years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="luVyPd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today Netflix was kind enough to let me know that  I've accidentally been paying for a DVD subscription for THIRTEEN FUCKING YEARS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been renting imaginary DVDs since &lt;br&gt;George Bush was president.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lesson here: keep an eye on your subscriptions. And vote Obama 2008. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iNtpuKzkdD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iNtpuKzkdD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Oatmeal (@Oatmeal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1349076285880819714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rmTfhs"&gt;(For our younger readers: yes, Netflix started out as a DVD rental service and then segued to the streaming service it is today.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T255hD"&gt;So it may be a good idea, especially if your income is a little tight, to check your current streaming subscriptions and drop the ones that you haven’t used for several months. (After all, unless you’re grandfathered into an especially good deal — and that’s happening less and less these days — you can always re-up again if there’s something on the service you want to watch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCmqvI"&gt;One thing to be aware of: during the process of canceling a streaming service, you may need to go through several pages or pop-ups urging you to not cancel or to at least settle for a less expensive (and usually less feature-filled) version of the service. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55637140"&gt;according to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, several lawsuits by such organizations as The Norwegian Consumer Council and Public Citizen in the US are claiming that Amazon Prime’s canceling process &lt;a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf"&gt;manipulates consumers into keeping their subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. So be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoLr9T"&gt;Here’s where you can go to cancel some of the more popular streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lwjUqE"&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netflix logo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hbwCRavkGxvN1FD3H8EZ1AvimA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/755523/netflix-logo-705px.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sx7uOC"&gt;You can find your current subscription status at Netflix by clicking on your personal icon on the top-right corner and &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount"&gt;choosing “Account.”&lt;/a&gt; The second section down should be “Plan Details,” and you’ll not only be able to change your plan, but you’ll immediately see if you have a live DVD plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53wLvq"&gt;If you want to leave the service completely, there is a “Cancel Membership” button to the left in the “Membership &amp;amp; Billing” section.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9dZwQI"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oUIfS7zhlNKY0wsyu1-yML49P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233388/Prime_0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XuoS2n"&gt;If you’re a month-to-month member of Amazon Prime and decide you want to cancel, you can go to this page and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=201910380&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;click on the “End Membership” button&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohwkqg"&gt;If, on the other hand, you’ve paid for an annual membership, you can only cancel within three days of signing up. You can also cancel that paid annual membership if you’ve just converted from a free trial or “if you and your account did not make any eligible purchases or take advantage of Prime benefits since your latest Prime membership charge” (in other words, if you’ve never used any of your Prime benefits since you paid for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAg6OG"&gt;If you want to completely close your Amazon account &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; delete all of your data, you can go &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy/data-deletion?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GBa63i"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmuPy5Z2FZqt75qJPQ422GM_OPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233417/HBO_Max_Press_On_White_Horiz_300dpi_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W1o4c8"&gt;HBO Max can be subscribed to either by itself, or through a number of different providers, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Roku, and a bunch of others. The best way to find out how to drop the service is to go to HBO’s &lt;a href="https://help.hbomax.com/Answer/Detail/2334"&gt;help page on canceling your subscription or trial&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on the appropriate link for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twhHFa"&gt;According to HBO, you should try to cancel one or two days before your billing cycle renews, and if you cancel mid-month, you will still have access to HBO Max until the month is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5GdnwM"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsdiTYeTe2jHpMVh0DlhWOaRtDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15985971/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mufJxC"&gt;As with HBO Max, your Apple TV Plus subscription will be useable until the end of the billing cycle, even after you cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3o7IZ"&gt;Instructions for canceling your Apple subscriptions &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="95HoHH"&gt;To cancel on your Mac, go to the App Store, click your name (at the bottom of the page) and then “View Information” (at the top). Go to “Subscriptions” &amp;gt; “Manage.” Click on “Edit” next to the subscription you want to cancel and select “Cancel Subscription.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWkYfG"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings,” select your name, then “Subscriptions.” Select the subscription you want to leave, and Tap on Cancel Subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfdY9N"&gt;Hulu&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQaMvXMCCjH7-ridKyC3od2ac2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233427/Screen_Shot_2021_01_13_at_2.52.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hulu&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ypKXj"&gt;Like Apple TV Plus and HBO Max, your canceled subscription will last until the end of your billing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2cKxA"&gt;Hulu offers &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/cancel-hulu-subscription?language=en_US"&gt;instructions on how to cancel here&lt;/a&gt;. Since, like HBO Max, there’s a good chance you’ve signed up through a third party such as Amazon, Verizon, or Sprint, there are several links on the page where you can get specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OqzcDf"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COfUCxET7zyumttSE81Rhqm55h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233437/yt_tv_full_rgb_black_copy.max_2800x2800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zpNbg7"&gt;Interestingly, you can either cancel or pause your YouTube TV subscription (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129668"&gt;links for either process are on the same page&lt;/a&gt;). Pausing is a good option if for some reason (a vacation, a work project, temporary financial difficulties) you don’t want to use the subscription for anywhere from four weeks to six months. You won’t be able to use the service during that time to watch or record, but your already-recorded content will be saved. Once the pause is over (either via a pre-selected date or if you manually end the pause period), your billing will recommence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtTO6J"&gt;If you want to leave YouTube TV entirely, select “Cancel Now” on that same page. You will still have service until the end of your payment period; after that, you’ll have another 21 days to view the recorded programs in your library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CmT6VJ"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="disney+" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mXvQjzF9LVi8uyKQpglhwA7KFZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13412121/disneyplus.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2tFAqP"&gt;To cancel your Disney Plus subscription on the website, go to your profile icon in the upper-right corner, and then click on “Account.” Find your subscription level under the subhead “Subscription,” click on that, and then scroll down to where it says “Cancel Subscription.” As with most other services, you will still have access to Disney Plus until the end of your billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVf6oh"&gt;Note that canceling Disney Plus TV does not cancel your general Disney account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vrUI9Z"&gt;ESPN Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w1-ZlWtg6ANQSl4BI5OPkfCSS90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233680/ESPN_PLUS_FC_NEG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESPN Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KSWxJH"&gt;ESPN Plus is another one of those services that is available via a number of third-party sources, such as Roku, Amazon, Apple Pay, and iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9OSuP"&gt;If you subscribed directly via the web and want to cancel your subscription, log in, select “Manage” &amp;gt; “Cancel Subscription.” Otherwise, if you subscribed through one of the services mentioned above, your best bet is to &lt;a href="https://help.espnplus.com/espnplus_hc?id=espnplus_article_content&amp;amp;sys_kb_id=f6dcac54dbb79498534deadc139619c5"&gt;go to this page&lt;/a&gt;, which links to all of the ways it’s possible to cancel, depending on how you originally subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3KWm0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ze7SrE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbWfpd"&gt;Amazon will now allow third-party companies the unprecedented privilege of accessing the core artificial intelligence underpinning its Alexa digital assistant, a first for the company’s AI platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bALIFC"&gt;While Amazon has allowed companies to build skills for Alexa and allows pretty much any consumer electronic device maker to integrate Alexa into a compatible product, the e-commerce giant has not licensed the underlying AI tech for use in other assistant-like products. Amazon is calling the new offering Alexa Custom Assistant, and it’s starting out with a focus on the auto market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqENyo"&gt;Amazon is doing so to allow not just automobile manufacturers, but any company with a need for a digital voice assistant more control over the software experience. This will allow companies to create their own wake words and custom voices and capabilities Amazon says will “co-exist” with Alexa as it’s designed to work today. For the auto market, this provides Amazon the added benefit of having its software built directly into cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifMQO5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Car makers can design custom wake words and record unique voices for their assistants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JAJZAn"&gt;“Building an intelligent assistant is complex, time-consuming, and costly. Further, the rate of innovation and change is accelerating and assistants are always improving and getting smarter, requiring substantial ongoing investments,” the company explains in a blog post. “The Alexa Custom Assistant addresses this challenge by allowing companies to leverage Alexa’s world-class technology stack to create their own intelligent assistant without the investment, long development cycles, and resources to build it from scratch and maintain over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLFH1G"&gt;Amazon says companies will get access to custom wake words that use “the same state-of-the-art process” used for developing new Alexa wake words. Companies can create  their own unique voices for the assistants with help from “voice science experts” from Amazon that will help manage the recording process and the machine learning-based algorithms to build out the voice library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWuXWN"&gt;The screens and software experiences inside car have proven to be a ripe market for companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. But only the latter two tech giants have their own mobile operating systems that allow for plug-in platforms like Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto. While Amazon’s Echo Auto platform can be accessed via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497169/amazon-alexa-app-ios-android-auto-mode-echo-in-car-voice-assistant"&gt;a mobile app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;through a dongle you plug into your car&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not as seamless as the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2aODS"&gt;So much like how Amazon has strategically worked around its disadvantage on mobile phones, where Siri and Google Assistant reign supreme, to carve out a dominant position in the smart home, it’s now trying to better position Alexa as a built-in solution in environments that may not require a phone at all, thereby bypassing the need to compete directly with Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KQ25v7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is using Alexa to compete with Apple and Google in the car software space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4RHsg"&gt;The first company that has agreed to build its own Alexa-based assistant is car maker Fiat Chrysler (FCA), which has had an ongoing relationship with Amazon to integrate some of its technology, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050529/amazon-fire-tv-bmw-fiat-chrysler-ces-2020"&gt;Amazon Fire TV-powered screens&lt;/a&gt;, into its cars. Financial terms of any arrangement between Amazon and FCA were not disclosed, and it’s not clear whether Amazon is charging car makers to license the AI tech rather than giving it out freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVMFVy"&gt;Regardless, Amazon also says its intentions are to give all companies, not just automakers, a faster, cheaper, and less complex route to building their own voice experiences that feel tailor-made, instead of simply bolting on an integration with a third-party service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYUczc"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant also lets the custom’s AI products stay in control of and dictate information about special features, while Alexa can handle more general app-related requests like music playback and directions. “For example, if a customer asks Alexa to roll down a car window, or how to troubleshoot a device, the request will be routed to the brand’s assistant. If a customer asks the brand’s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa,” the blog reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kWHQa"&gt;Amazon says Alexa Custom Assistant will be available starting today to carmakers in the US and Canada, as well as Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6rg7m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 8:46AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about Alexa Custom Assistant and how it’s available for more than just car makers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel has to be better than ‘lifestyle company’ Apple at making CPUs, says new CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEgGbV08ddIMYpC4zYwvsn8dlPY=/57x0:1992x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672176/intellogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkclz"&gt;Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, doesn’t start his new role until February, but he’s already prepping the company to take on Apple’s M1 chips. &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;, a local newspaper in Oregon where Intel maintains a large presence, &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html"&gt;reports that the chip maker&lt;/a&gt; held an all-hands company meeting yesterday, and Gelsinger attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avnQA2"&gt;“We have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes, Gelsinger reportedly told Intel employees. “We have to be that good, in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XtsIn"&gt;Intel has been facing increased competition from both Apple and AMD recently. Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;transition to its own silicon&lt;/a&gt; back in June, calling it a “historic day for the Mac.” The transition has gone well, with M1-based Macs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;providing impressive performance and battery life&lt;/a&gt; compared to existing Intel-based Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vw39M"&gt;While Apple will still use Intel chips for some Macs in the future, the move away from reliance on Intel is significant. It comes just as AMD has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;taken the performance crown&lt;/a&gt; from Intel in gaming, and pressures its laptop dominance with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;new Ryzen 5000 mobile chips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkaWTr"&gt;Intel announced earlier this week that current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;CEO Bob Swan is stepping down&lt;/a&gt; from the position on February 15th, set to be replaced by VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger. This marks a return to Intel for Gelsinger, who previously worked at the chip maker for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8Pxaz-BEMp1KC5irsrV-gT0ABM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22237510/intel.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Intel manufacturing facility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I5psXn"&gt;Gelsinger now faces the reality of competing with Apple, AMD, and others after Intel has struggled to transition to a 10nm manufacturing process for years. Intel has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;delayed its 7nm chips&lt;/a&gt; until at least 2022, and the company now faces a tough decision whether to outsource chip fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCtzuO"&gt;That’s a decision that Intel had scheduled to make next week, but &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian &lt;/em&gt;reports it could be delayed to give Gelsinger time to weigh in on the choice. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that Intel has been in talks with both TSMC and Samsung to outsource some chip production. Market research firm &lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210113-10651.html"&gt;TrendForce claims&lt;/a&gt; around 20 percent of Intel’s non-CPU chips will now be outsourced to both TSMC and UMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKYbE0"&gt;Analysts argue that outsourcing its own CPU production would allow Intel to be more flexible and focus on its designs to recover from the 10nm issues it has experienced. Apple, AMD, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other Intel competitors are already using TSMC for chip production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bumble disables politics filter after Capitol rioters spotted in dating app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkk_UtyJsZVSZE40kGOZzOt-laQ=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68671854/bumble_fb_share.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XLkPYf"&gt;Dating app Bumble has temporarily disabled a feature which allowed users to filter potential matches based on their political leanings, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bumble/status/1349739735950843907"&gt;service has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature allows users to identify and filter matches with options such as “Apolitical,” “Moderate,” “Liberal,” and “Conservative.” In a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-removes-political-filter-capitol-riot/?europe=true"&gt;statement given to &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bumble said it had temporarily removed the feature in the US to “prevent misuse and abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr7mLP"&gt;News of the change emerged after Bumble users reported seeing individuals on the app who appeared to have participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;riots at the Capitol building last week&lt;/a&gt;. On January 7th, Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347226225278935045"&gt;Alia Awadallah reported&lt;/a&gt; seeing “dozens” of men on dating apps that appeared to be in Washington, DC on the day of the riots. They suggested &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347231610165469185"&gt;taking screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of these profiles, and submitting this as evidence to the FBI following its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1347175086432907272"&gt;call for information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="REmxue"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm on hold with FBI and police. No idea if this will end up being useful but I feel like there's a good story there anyway, so everyone get on the apps and start screenshotting.&lt;/p&gt;— Alia Awadallah (@aawadall) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aawadall/status/1347231610165469185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbymup"&gt;One user reported getting more attention on Bumble after posting pictures of himself at the Capitol. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/-no-regrets-a-capitol-rioter-tells-his-story-from-inside"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fellows said he had entered the Capitol building with the mob, and even smoked a joint in the office of a US Senator. Fellows boasted that his profile on Bumble was “blowing up” after he posted pictures from the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAnzWW"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allisonnorris/status/1347416130500096000"&gt;widely shared tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Allison Norris reported that Bumble’s political feature filter had been used by “a friend of a friend” to increase her chances of matching with rioters who’d then send her pictures and videos of themselves in the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OAcGAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I know a friend of a friend who changed her preference on Bumble to Conservative. She’s matching with MAGA bros and they’re bragging and sending her pics and videos of them in the Capitol. She’s sending them to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;— Allison #FreeThemALL Norris (@allisonnorris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allisonnorris/status/1347416130500096000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HmxgLe"&gt;As of January 14th, users were reporting that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hilarialexander/status/1349707763686010891/photo/1"&gt;politics filter had disappeared&lt;/a&gt; as an option from the app. Bumble subsequently confirmed that it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BumbleSupport/status/1349740246909390849"&gt;temporarily disabled the feature&lt;/a&gt;, though it stopped short of saying it was disabled in direct relation to the Capitol riots. It added that it was removing the profiles of confirmed persons participating in the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s5TEcN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've temporarily removed our politics filter to prevent misuse. However, please rest assured that we prohibit any content that promotes terrorism or racial hatred, and we've already removed any users that have been confirmed as participants in the attack of the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;— bumble (@BumbleSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BumbleSupport/status/1349740246909390849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UozbMx"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; Bumble said its service prohibits content that “encourages any illegal activity” and that it would cooperate with law enforcement in relation to the profiles. “On January 6, we immediately ensured that our hate speech scanning and protocols addressed the attack on the U.S. Capitol and began removing any insurrection-related content from our platform,” a spokesperson said, “If we see anything that would suggest someone has or is in the process of committing a potentially criminal act we will take appropriate steps with law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boVtKZ"&gt;Following its call for evidence, the FBI reported earlier this week that it has received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227633/doj-fbi-evidence-capitol-trump-riot-attack"&gt;over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence&lt;/a&gt; after the attack on the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 MacBook Pro will ditch the Touch Bar and bring back MagSafe, say reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/578LDvIoamqsoVtOTsZuIoUSoFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68671647/akramer_201113_4290_0007.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43m1v7"&gt;Apple is planning a major MacBook Pro redesign for the third quarter of 2021, according to a research note written by TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo and reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/14/kuo-details-2021-macbook-pro-new-design-with-squared-off-sides-magsafe-connector-and-io-return-touch-bar-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/15/kuo-two-redesigned-macbook-pro-models-with-magsafe-no-touch-bar-coming-in-q3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo calls it the first major redesign of the MacBook Pro since the introduction of the current generation in 2016. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has followed up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-macbook-pros-with-magsafe-return-in-the-works"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; corroborating many of the same details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyoot7"&gt;The new MacBook Pro is said to have squared-off sides like the iPad Pro and the iPhone 12; the current laptop already has sharp edges, but it sounds like the top and bottom panels are going to be flatter than before as well. The new model will reportedly come in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes both featuring Apple-designed Arm processors, with no Intel options. Kuo says the laptops will use a similar heat pipe system to the current 16-inch MacBook Pro, giving more thermal headroom and enabling higher performance. Bloomberg reports that the new models will have “brighter, higher contrast” displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8rkiH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New story: For new high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, Apple indeed plans return of MagSafe, the end of the Touch Bar (finally), brighter screens, minor design changes, next-gen M-series chips and more. Launch around mid-2021. &lt;a href="https://t.co/eL3r06oexW"&gt;https://t.co/eL3r06oexW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1349973715623178241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi5ZQg"&gt;Perhaps most notably, Kuo believes the new Pro laptops will backtrack on some of the controversial changes Apple made with the current generation. The OLED Touch Bar, for example, is said to have been replaced altogether by physical function keys. Kuo also says that there’ll be a wider range of ports reducing the need for dongles, though he doesn’t get specific. And a MagSafe magnetic charging connector is also set to return. (It’s not clear whether it’ll have anything in common with the new MagSafe accessory system for the iPhone 12.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8jpjj"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; was just released in November, but that model otherwise had near-identical hardware to the existing Intel version. If Kuo is to be believed — and his track record suggests that he is — the next models could be a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbPjpx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Jan 15th, 2.45PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of Bloomberg’s subsequent report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6BO1zF"&gt;A developer going by the name of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patr10tic"&gt;Patr10tic&lt;/a&gt; has created &lt;a href="https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/"&gt;an interactive map&lt;/a&gt; using GPS metadata and videos from the app Parler to offer a glimpse of what was happening inside and around the Capitol building during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;the violent protest&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdmm8/developer-makes-interactive-map-of-parler-videos-from-capitol-hill-riots"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtCGTk"&gt;The project is an expansion on similar maps &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;like the one &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate just how many Parler users were part of the mob that occupied the Capitol building, based off an archive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;created by a researcher known as @donk_enby&lt;/a&gt;. Patr10tic’s map (currently named “Y’all Qaeda”) uses the same archive and connects GPS coordinates with actual video, offering a map of red icons placed around the Capitol for each associated video post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1Aidl"&gt; Viewing the videos has an unsettling quality, not just because of the intersection of conspiracy theories and white supremacist ideology on display, but also the perspective they offer on the Capitol itself. Most people haven’t seen the chambers of Congress and the halls of the Capitol outside of press photos or &lt;em&gt;C-SPAN&lt;/em&gt; live feeds. Seeing protesters milling about in Congressional offices feels strange, but it’s even stranger seeing them wander through the Capitol building, unbothered, with police looking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHEkKr"&gt;Whatever feelings watching the videos provoke, the map and other projects like it could prove vital to investigating just how the events of January 6th took place. Parler’s already been identified &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/"&gt;as a site for planning last week’s protests&lt;/a&gt;, and this growing, mapped compilation of posts shows that it was one of the main ways it was documented as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fn7Q36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will gradually remove chargers and earbuds from future phones  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IdAoNgju0Ospakpat_qY_HC2yqU=/216x0:1271x703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68670789/galaxy_s21_5g_highlights_box.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IOacv4"&gt;Samsung’s future phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;will also&lt;/a&gt; not come with charging bricks, the company &lt;a href="http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/answers-to-your-questions-about-the-galaxy-s21-series-from-samsung-mobile-executives"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s leaving itself some wiggle room. In a Q&amp;amp;A about why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/14/22231102/samsung-apple-kill-charging-brick-obituary-eulogy"&gt;it’s no longer including headphones and a charging brick in the box&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says it believes &lt;em&gt;gradually&lt;/em&gt; removing the accessories from its phones could help make them more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvvecV"&gt;This answer implies that, while the next generations of its phones may not come with the included accessories, some may. Samsung has other lines that it brands as Galaxy, from its folding phones to its more budget options, and it’s left itself room to keep including a charger in some of them for a little while longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxANF4"&gt;Maybe Samsung wants to keep the charger around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220858/samsung-a02s-us-unlocked-verizon-att"&gt;in cheaper phones&lt;/a&gt; so people who aren’t tech enthusiasts will have a higher likelihood of buying them, or maybe it doesn’t want to upset the people who buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21407750/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-price-release-date-hinge-screen-durability"&gt;its $2,000 phones&lt;/a&gt;. It could do both, either, or neither, and it would still count as “gradually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbGsMY"&gt;The company doesn’t appear, however, to be following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple’s route of pulling the plugs from its lineup of existing phones&lt;/a&gt;. The listings for the Note 20 Ultra and Note 10 still show a charger coming in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A “what’s in the box” image of the Note 20 Ultra, including a charging brick." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tC2N5qlU-eL6ocGQJh-WYOFKv9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236779/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_4.24.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 Ultra looks to still include a charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8adKhW"&gt;While a company shipping older products with something that’s no longer included in its latest and greatest might seem odd, it means Samsung doesn’t have to re-make all the boxes for its old products, and that consumers won’t end up in the awkward situation where they watch an unboxing from a phone’s launch on YouTube and then have a decidedly different experience. Which approach is correct really depends what you’re optimizing for, but this seems to be the one Samsung has chosen: slow and steady wins the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5lUFA"&gt;You can read the full answer down below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gWPCmn"&gt;We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have and making sustainable choices in their daily lives to promote better recycling habits. To support our Galaxy community in this journey, we are transitioning to removal of the charger plug and earphones in our latest line of Galaxy smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mllep"&gt;We believe that the gradual removal of charger plugs and earphones from our in-box device packaging can help address sustainable consumption issues and remove any pressure that consumers may feel towards continually receiving unnecessary charger accessories with new phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1V567T"&gt;We’ve also been implementing standardized USB-C type charging ports since 2017, so older chargers can still be compatible with our newest Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Car Thing shows up in FCC filings with a new design and bigger screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uez6rpgNlX61LAa1TslCBpw55tE=/2x0:1732x1153/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68670464/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of Spotify’s Car Thing, taken from FCC filings.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: FCC filings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ayzaT0"&gt;Back in May 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"&gt;Spotify announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be publicly testing a voice-controlled smart assistant for cars that the company called “Car Thing.” But nearly two years on, we haven’t heard much from the project — though that might change soon. A Car Thing with a totally new design and a bigger screen has appeared &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AP3D-YX5H6679"&gt;in FCC filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TXMlN"&gt;This new version of the Car Thing seems like it will function similarly to the 2019 version — it’s a “voice controlled accessory for phone/Spotify App with supporting display and buttons,” according to a description found in the filings. “Bluetooth enabled for communication with the Car Head Unit. Powered from a 12V outlet,” continues the description, bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B5Qj9"&gt;The design, though, is radically different. The new Car Thing looks almost like a mini-tablet, with some kind of button and a large knob. It’s pictured at the top of this post. Compare it to this image from Spotify of the version it announced in 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zus0O3A9yF07LbqHlRnu_5xVOus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236672/device_testdrive_1100x618.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s image of what the Car Thing looked like in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pEhMgJ"&gt;And if you want to get a better look at the newer version, we’ve collected some photos from the new FCC filings in this gallery, including a few of the device powered on. Disappointingly, though, it’s hard to tell anything about how the device actually works from the photos, or what the software looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwTNxP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10284862"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8z4AH"&gt;It’s also unclear if this is a product people will ever be able to get their hands on. A product hitting the FCC doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be released for the general public. And we never heard much about the 2019 version of the Car Thing following its initial announcement (though that one also had &lt;a href="https://www.stereonet.co.uk/news/spotifys-car-thing-to-deliver-in-car-music-streaming"&gt;a trip through the FCC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSwUbS"&gt;“Spotify is focused on becoming the world’s number one audio platform, and we’re continuing tests of a voice-controlled music and podcast device to help us learn more about how people listen to audio in the car,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after the original publication of this article. “While we don’t have any further news to share at this time, we’re always testing and seeking feedback from our users before rolling out new features or products broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H2zVWq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify begins testing its first hardware: a car smart assistant","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WJisUl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 8:17PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Spotify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
