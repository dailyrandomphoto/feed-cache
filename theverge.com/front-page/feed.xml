    <title>Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first to support HomeKit Secure Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37zrbrLX1IEHZRskLwbQfrO7-fc=/189x0:2292x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479647/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_1.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgILyD"&gt;Logitech has quietly revealed a new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGS2VC%2FA%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Circle View Wired Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera today, which is notably the first consumer smart doorbell to support Apple’s recent HomeKit Secure Video standard. The new doorbell is available from both Apple and Logitech’s websites for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68qgFf"&gt;Apple first debuted the HomeKit Secure Video standard in 2019, but it’s taken some time for developers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adopt the system&lt;/a&gt;. Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first doorbell camera to offer it, at least on a consumer level (technically, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the Robin ProLine camera beat Logitech to the punch, although that product is designed for commercial customers rather than home installations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmT0TT"&gt;As for the camera itself, it’s design to exclusively work with Apple’s HomeKit system (so no Alexa or Google Nest support). The Circle View Wired Doorbell offers a 160-degree DFOV from a 5-megapixel sensor that shoots 1200 x 1600 video in HDR. There’s also an integrated light strip for nighttime that can light up to show visitors up to six feet away, along with color night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvdHmgY56ZZ41DoXrj0u2vDRywc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154964/HPGS2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5a5ClF"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video allows for Logitech to outsource most of the actual “security camera” side of things to Apple’s software, using the Apple Home app to notify users when visitors are outside. It also uses Apple’s iCloud service for streaming, storing, and sharing video recordings, and Apple TV or HomePod devices function as main processing hubs for determining when people or vehicles are outside and for running &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/face-recognition-iph04af43727/ios"&gt;Apple’s face recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; (based on your photo library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF8jmU"&gt;The Circle View Wired Doorbell camera is available for $199.99 (with Logitech also offering a $299.99 bundle that includes home installation through its website). To take full advantage of the HomeKit functionality, though, customers will also need a HomePod mini, HomePod, iPad, or Apple TV to serve as a HomeKit hub, as well as an iCloud storage plan for saving videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s official Galaxy S21, 21 Plus, and 21 Ultra teasers have leaked, and the camera squircle is gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWgBsxXaSoexGgtZQSEKbS3EUpA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479492/samsung_galaxy_s21_plus_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91arj8"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship phones the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are widely expected to arrive this January (alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22054757/galaxy-buds-pro-leaked-images-renders-rounded-design-case"&gt;some new buds&lt;/a&gt;), but we haven’t had a true glimpse at them yet. That may be changing today, as &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;has just published&lt;/a&gt; three brief teaser videos that it says come directly from Samsung, and line up perfectly with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521860/samsung-galaxy-phones-january-2021-renders-leak"&gt;the OnLeaks renders&lt;/a&gt; we first saw in October.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4zp2zRZ7UOWkc2_K4LUD2HHGqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154918/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9q3nOGRCjCWFQpSKgj8Kc269jA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154919/samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_668_leak.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="re4oz4"&gt;While we can’t glean too much from these videos, they make it crystal clear what to expect from the design of these phones — a sleek, streamlined new camera bump that blends into the sides of the phone, with three cameras on the S21 and S21 Plus and five cameras (including what appears to be a periscope zoom lens, see the square shape) on the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha0Ubd"&gt;Your eagle eyes can probably also see that the S21 Ultra will have a curved screen, instead of the flat panels on the S21 and S21 Plus, and the names of all three phones include “5G” so there’ll hopefully be zero confusion about which networks they support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta5PM8"&gt;Otherwise, we have to consult previous leaks to see what these phones might be all about. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;claimed in November&lt;/a&gt; that we’d be looking at 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.8-inch phones, respectively — each with 120Hz screens; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; or Exynos 2100 processors; and 4,000mAh, 4,800mAh, and 5,000mAh batteries, respectively. However, the S21 Ultra will supposedly come with the brightest screen on a Samsung phone yet at 1,600 nits. It’ll also reportedly have an adaptive refresh rate that goes all the way down to 1Hz, as well as S Pen stylus support (but no integrated slot), while the standard S21 may have a plastic back instead of glass this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVI6d"&gt;The Ultra will also purportedly have an improved 108MP camera sensor and two telephoto lenses, one at 3x optical and one at 10x optical, each with larger pixels to gather more light than previous zooms. But its main camera and ultrawide camera are suspected to use the same 12MP sensors across the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aox2aB"&gt;According to filings at Brazil’s regulatory agency, the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s21_family_wont_have_a_charger_or_earphones_in_the_box-news-46634.php"&gt;may also ship without a charger or earbuds in the box&lt;/a&gt; — which would be pretty rich, considering how &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-apple-charger-box-1169323/"&gt;it made fun of Apple for doing the same&lt;/a&gt; only a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Gaming starts Black creator program with guaranteed monthly pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W23fMFUzloV0m1_auynY4LbgSgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479048/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NR1ZUi"&gt;Today, Facebook Gaming announces a new initiative targeted specifically at Black streamers on the platform: the Black Gaming Creator Program. The company says it plans to invest $5 million a year over the next two years to support the Black gaming creator community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6GxYQ"&gt;If you’re selected to take part in the program, there are some benefits. You’ll get Facebook Gaming partnership, early product access (along with product feedback sessions), community support — which includes invitations to all digital and in person events — and mentorship. The program also comes with guaranteed monthly pay, which distinguishes it from other creator mentorship programs. Interested creators can apply &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/black-gaming-creators-program"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUijmS"&gt;Leo Olebe, the global director of games partnerships at Facebook, said in a statement that the new initiative was part of Facebook’s $200 million commitment to support Black-owned businesses and organizations, which the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/supporting-black-and-diverse-communities/"&gt;announced this summer&lt;/a&gt;. “Game streaming brings people together in a powerful way over a shared passion for games, and we hope to encourage more people to express their creativity through gaming,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxFXZU"&gt;It’s an interesting move from Facebook, not least because it’s rare that a company puts money where it says its values are. On the other hand: Facebook did not say how many creators would be admitted into the program. The company did, however, clarify that monthly pay would vary based on “the quality of their content and the scale of their audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGL1G6"&gt;Nevertheless, it’s an example that other players in the live-streaming industry would do well to follow — because Black creators need support on those other platforms, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie confirms Destiny 2 crossplay is coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XwyFeBaLNbCooPTiYmzYZgfdls0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478687/media_stasis_3.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkL9Wa"&gt;Bungie has confirmed &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will be getting crossplay support at some point next year. While Bungie didn’t specify which platforms will support the feature, hopefully you’ll be able to dive into &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; with players across every platform on which the game is available. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. Earlier this year, it seemed as though a 2021 launch date for crossplay was &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crossplay-is-on-bungies-roadmap-heres-wh/1100-6478183/"&gt;the goal&lt;/a&gt;, but Bungie was more definite about a launch next year in a &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49957"&gt;blog post published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLVExl"&gt;Bungie has slowly been making the game more platform-agnostic. The studio added cross-save support, which lets you bring your save from one platform to another, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And alongside the next-gen update for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49650"&gt;that’s out today&lt;/a&gt;, the game will support cross-generation play, meaning that PS5 players will still be able to play with people on PS4, for example. The next-gen update also allows the game to run at up to 60fps and 4K resolution on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, adds an FOV slider, and improves load times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRtxWi"&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;still doesn’t have&lt;/a&gt; full anti-cheat on PC. If Bungie doesn’t implement stricter anti-cheating measures before the launch of crossplay, console players may run into cheaters if they are able to play with people on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4bJnb3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Bungie is launching cross-save for Destiny 2 on August 21st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube live streams now support HDR  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2L2DRm6rO5nip8gwmTMxU7oT5g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478580/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="myY5Sq"&gt;Starting today, YouTube creators can live-stream their videos in high dynamic range (HDR), the company has announced. The platform has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13547710/google-youtube-hdr-video-support"&gt;HDR in prerecorded content&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, but now, live content can also benefit from the technology. YouTube claims it’s “the first major platform to support live HDR.” At launch it supports the HDR10 and HLG standards, and YouTube says it hopes to expand this offering in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSu8Bs"&gt;HDR is a technology that lets videos show a wider range of colors and brightness. Blacks can be darker and whites can be brighter, revealing more detail in the shadows and highlights of an image, respectively. The result is that images appear much more punchy and vibrant leading &lt;a href="https://hdtvtest.co.uk/n/Experts-Say-HDR-Is-More-Important-Than-4K-and-8K-Resolution"&gt;some to argue&lt;/a&gt; that the jump from SDR (standard dynamic range) to HDR offers a bigger benefit than the jump from 1080p to 4K. YouTube added support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13783272/youtube-update-4k-live-streaming-support-360-video"&gt;4K live-streaming back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6yoct"&gt;In order to benefit from the new technology, creators will need to use one of the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported encoders&lt;/a&gt; Google lists, and viewers will need to be watching on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported playback device&lt;/a&gt; like the YouTube app on HDR TVs, a Chromecast Ultra, or an Android device with an HDR display. YouTube says it plans to add support for more encoders and mobile devices to stream HDR content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieTUQd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 8th, 12:49PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation that the HDR formats supported are HDR10 and HLG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is still making its mysterious Fuchsia OS, and now it wants your help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCKWRoM8amdC5-uQM6GzAiNkymQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478578/fuschia.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GL7PIz"&gt;It’s been over four years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;since we first found out that Google is developing a new operating system called Fuchsia&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unique because it’s not based on a Linux kernel; instead, it uses a microkernel called Zircon. It’s also unique because, despite being developed “in the open” on publicly browsable repositories, nobody really understands what the OS is for, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed"&gt;Google executives have been remarkably coy&lt;/a&gt; about it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gaIPY"&gt;Today, that mix of trends continues as the company announces that it’s opening up a little more by asking for more public contributors from outside its organization. Google says it has “created new public mailing lists for project discussions, added a governance model to clarify how strategic decisions are made, and opened up the issue tracker for public contributors to see what’s being worked on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDYGO8"&gt;It’s been a while since we’ve seen a dive into the code and documentation Google has made available, though there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/8/15579846/google-fuchsia-os-magenta-armadillo-first-look-ui"&gt;some early UI examples&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s post today emphasizes that “Fuchsia is not ready for general product development or as a development target,” but it’s likely that the announcement will spur another round of analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CijmpO"&gt;We know that Fuchsia isn’t necessarily meant to be a one-for-one replacement for Android or Chrome OS. The most interesting clues to Fuchsia’s practical implementations come from the fact that we know it has been tested on hardware that eventually gets released as Google smart speakers — though when they’re released, they aren’t running Fuchsia. Kyle Bradshaw at &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/03/06/fuchsia-friday-nelson-luis-hint-made-by-google/"&gt;laid out several examples&lt;/a&gt; of Fuchsia codenames lining up with “Made by Google” devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIKs24"&gt;Google simply calls Fuchsia a “production-grade operating system that is secure, updatable, inclusive, and pragmatic.” In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed"&gt;interview on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer characterized Fuchsia may be optimized for “certain other form factors” beyond phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BHUBnN"&gt;We’re looking at what a new take on an operating system could be like. And so I know out there people are getting pretty excited saying, ‘Oh this is the new Android,” or, “This is the new Chrome OS.” Fuchsia is really not about that. Fuchsia is about just pushing the state of the art in terms of operating systems and things that we learn from Fuchsia we can incorporate into other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ybokLu"&gt;Along with the new mailing lists and call for contributors, Google is also publishing a “technical roadmap,” but it mainly focuses on low-level OS stuff like “a driver framework for updating the kernel independently of the drivers” and the “Fuchsia Interface Definition Language.” Fuchsia’s roadmap implies that many of the initial subsystems are being revamped, with a new IO library and component architecture, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUUlWs"&gt;Google runs lots of open-source projects that are nominally developed by anybody but in practice are mostly made by Google’s engineers. Fuchsia looks to be the same sort of thing. In the new governance model the company is announcing today, it says “Google steers the direction of Fuchsia and makes platform decisions” but encourages outside contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnOgLU"&gt;Developers can visit &lt;a href="http://fuchsia.dev"&gt;fuchsia.dev&lt;/a&gt; to find out more and also download the code necessary to build the source code and run an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine starts working within two weeks after first shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NHS England Starts Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OA-Wx5gG17jIcaIbt53mXR7p6CE=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478296/1230010917.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kbWrNH"&gt;The Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and starts working within about two weeks of the first dose, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; published by the Food and Drug Administration today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YM96R9"&gt;The materials are the first look at the vaccine data from the perspective of the FDA staff, rather than the drug companies. They were released ahead of the agency’s vaccine advisory committee meeting on December 10th. Like data released by Pfizer, the FDA’s briefing document shows that the vaccine is 95 percent effective at protecting against symptomatic COVID-19, and there are no serious safety concerns with the shot. It worked similarly for people in all racial and ethnic groups and of all ages in which it was tested. (There isn’t data available on children younger than 16.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePHkd3"&gt;“This is what an A+ report card looks like for a vaccine,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSPx4j"&gt;While the FDA will decide whether to authorize the vaccine on Thursday, other countries have already started administering the shots. Early this morning, a 90-year-old woman in the United Kingdom became the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-begins-rollout-of-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-in-a-first-for-the-west-11607419672"&gt;first person&lt;/a&gt; to receive the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine outside of a clinical trial. The UK authorized the vaccine for emergency use last week and started a mass vaccination campaign today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfyKGG"&gt;Protection could kick in quickly. About 10 days after the first dose, more cases of COVID-19 started appearing in the group of people who received the placebo than in the group that took the vaccine, according to the materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E0j1pN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;FDA just posted the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine data here.&lt;br&gt;Lots of good stuff.&lt;a href="https://t.co/ycGOU5fQkp"&gt;https://t.co/ycGOU5fQkp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;example: Looks like one dose may induce meaningful protection around day 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KiYnQoi0wM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KiYnQoi0wM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— William Gibson (@wgibson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wgibson/status/1336298050315313158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hPmTZ4"&gt;That doesn’t mean one shot is enough, however. The study wasn’t designed to figure that out, and most participants went on to get a second dose. The second dose of a vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587664/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-two-doses-shots"&gt;functions as a booster&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the immune system to produce long-lasting memory cells that stick around to protect against the virus in the future. Even if the first dose offers some protection in the short-term, the second dose is critical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbZSG"&gt;The FDA’s analysis notes there are still data gaps around the vaccine. The clinical trial only followed people for two months, and it’s unclear how long protection from COVID-19 will last. It’s unclear how well the vaccine could work in kids, and there isn’t data on pregnant people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efgk8M"&gt;The trial also wasn’t designed to check if the vaccine can stop people from spreading the virus. Preventing symptomatic illness is a huge benefit. It would prevent some of the devastating consequences of the virus, keep people out of the hospital, and ease the strain on the health care system. But if people who were vaccinated could still have asymptomatic infections, the vaccines wouldn’t necessarily stop the spread entirely. Other measures, like mask wearing and social distancing, would still be important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZdJhN"&gt;The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee will meet on Thursday, and the agency could authorize the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for emergency use soon after. States are preparing to give the first shots to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; on December 15th. The company said it could have enough of this vaccine for 12.5 million people by the end of 2020, and the United States has access to 100 million more doses — enough for 50 million people with two shots each. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;turned down an option&lt;/a&gt; to order more doses from Pfizer, raising concerns about shortages through the spring if there are not vaccines from other companies available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnLQgm"&gt;You can read the FDA’s full report &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go’s next paid event is a virtual tour of Kanto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ha3aokJtztGoG8mFt_Nq5p0QGgo=/0x160:3840x2720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478183/OOzO8_rA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7LnSI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;is celebrating its fifth anniversary with a virtual event, Niantic announced today. The Pokémon Go Tour, a ticketed one-day event set to take place on February 20th, 2021, will allow players to choose from either a Red or Green Version-themed experience — a throwback to the original Game Boy titles released in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9h8lbh"&gt;In addition to research, trades, and event-exclusive items, all of the original 150 pokémon will be available as shiny versions. Both versions include pokémon specific to that experience. In order to get all 150, you’ll have to trade with friends who purchased the other event version; Niantic will increase the trade range to 40 km to make it easier on players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr2NFG"&gt;Tickets go on sale today for $11.99 and are available in-app. The event will run from 9AM to 9PM in players’ local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVdBxU"&gt;Last month, Niantic announced its biggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572831/pokemon-go-update-kalos-region-seasons-level-50"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; to the game yet with seasons, a new level cap, and addition pokémon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbZDqi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch SpaceX fly a prototype of its Starship rocket to its highest altitude yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izSE1T1styfUSfanRx1Gt8cG_90=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478163/SN8_20201110.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIuNfK"&gt;Sometime today, SpaceX hopes to conduct a pivotal test flight of its next-generation Starship rocket, flying a prototype of the vehicle to its highest altitude yet. The company plans to launch the massive rocket to a height of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, up above SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, before landing the vehicle back down on the ground again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YISOcP"&gt;The test is meant to prove out Starship’s capability of launching and landing upright, something the spacecraft will be expected to do both on Earth and on other worlds. SpaceX aims to use Starship to send cargo and people to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. A test like this will help demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform a controlled flight and see if the rocket’s hardware — particularly the three main Raptor engines — functions as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFXPd7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Launch and landing are just part of the test today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej2px2"&gt;Launch and landing are just part of today’s test. On its website, SpaceX claims the Starship prototype will actually perform “a landing flip maneuver, which would be a first for a vehicle of this size.” There aren’t many details about the maneuver publicly available, but it’s a risky test that could easily go wrong, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?s=20"&gt;only giving the flight a “1/3 chance” of success&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX itself is also deemphasizing the possibility that the test will pull off a perfect launch and landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UA3Gf"&gt;“With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;SpaceX wrote about the flight on its website&lt;/a&gt;. But if all goes well, the flight will put the company on course to attempt even more ambitious tests in the future, eventually culminating in Starship’s first launch to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P30HAF"&gt;For this test, SpaceX plans to provide a live stream of the flight, which will go live just ahead of takeoff. However, it’s hard to give a solid time for when that will happen. The Federal Aviation Administration released flight restrictions for the airspace around Boca Chica from 9AM to 6PM ET, and there are flight restrictions in place for Wednesday and Thursday of this week, too. “The schedule is dynamic and likely to change, as is the case with all development testing,” SpaceX writes. The company will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX"&gt;provide updates through Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to follow SpaceX throughout the day to catch a glimpse of this rocket’s flight.&lt;/p&gt;
