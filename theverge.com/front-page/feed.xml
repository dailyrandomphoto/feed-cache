    <title>Apple is requiring masks again at all US retail stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFTDMXcCnSWV9xPeXmYwluX9qjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270378/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOfkHh"&gt;Apple is again requiring customers to wear masks in all its US retail stores after it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;reportedly rolled back the mandate for around half of its locations&lt;/a&gt;. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the company said that “amid rising cases in many communities, we now require that all customers join our team members in wearing masks while visiting our stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqYlz"&gt;While employees have been required to wear masks throughout most of the pandemic, customers haven’t always had to, which has led to outbreaks at some Apple stores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that some locations will have occupancy limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5IAIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reportedly started dropping mask mandates for some stores in November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8jhBI"&gt;Apple’s current mask policy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763958/apple-mask-requirements-retail-store-customers-coronavirus"&gt;reportedly enacted in early November&lt;/a&gt; when some retail stores dropped the requirement following increased vaccination rates and decreased infection rates. This cycle seems to be a repeat of what happened this summer — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;started relaxing mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; for some stores in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;brought them back&lt;/a&gt; at most locations in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdyi7h"&gt;Apple is reinstating these requirements as the number of COVID infections in the US is again on the rise, even as booster shots start to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65K1T"&gt;This change also comes after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;widespread outbreak was reported at an Apple store&lt;/a&gt; in Southlake, Texas, earlier this month. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;According to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, 22 employees at the location tested positive for COVID following Black Friday, where some staff reported that customers (who were not required to wear masks) were packed into the store “shoulder to shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ljTxM"&gt;Apple also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures in stores to support the wellbeing of customers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s easier for hackers to jailbreak the PS4 than it is to buy a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ps4 stock playstation 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXwrRHNWeSfTLn9gUTfY0nAVcso=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270314/ps4.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEj60u"&gt;Hackers have jailbroken the PS4 with a new kernel exploit, &lt;a href="https://wololo.net/2021/12/13/ps4-9-00-jailbreak-poobs4-released/"&gt;according to Wololo.net&lt;/a&gt;, a website that covers jailbreaking news, seemingly opening the door for people to run things like homebrew apps on Sony’s last-gen consoles. The jailbreak is called “pOOBs4.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66tX5x"&gt;It’s a major development, but it comes with a big catch: the jailbreak only works on PS4 firmware 9.00 or lower, according to one of the people involved with the jailbreak, SpecterDev, which isn’t the newest PS4 software available. If you’ve already updated to the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps4/system-software/"&gt;latest firmware, 9.03&lt;/a&gt;, the jailbreak apparently won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q8g9s0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seeing a bit of confusion on 9.03 - this will *not* work on 9.03, it's patched. Only 9.00 and below.&lt;/p&gt;— Specter (@SpecterDev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470302473189535747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1lthK"&gt;Here’s a video from SpecterDev showing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470225946007556097"&gt;unofficial software running on the PS4&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EDwcP7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;9.  (awesome work by chendochap &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Znullptr&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://t.co/ME12bLyu3C"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ME12bLyu3C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Specter (@SpecterDev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpecterDev/status/1470225946007556097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRQYn4"&gt;The kernel exploit &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; affects PS5, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr/status/1470263207122161668"&gt;according to Znullptr, another person involved with the jailbreak&lt;/a&gt;, but don’t get your hopes up about being able to mod your PS5’s software anytime soon, if ever. Znullptr says a PS5 version of the jailbreak “is not ready or being released” because the lead developer doesn’t have a PS5. (And it might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;hard to get one of the elusive consoles for a while&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3pxFZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright, was just a joke about caturday.&lt;br&gt;The exploit is legit, and as a bonus:&lt;br&gt;The kernel exploit affects Playstation5 as well!&lt;br&gt;(no, ps5 is not ready or being released, the lead developer does not currently have a ps5 console)&lt;/p&gt;— Z (@Znullptr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Znullptr/status/1470263207122161668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Oversight Board raises alarm over Facebook’s role in Ethiopian conflict</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqt0G_VhkiCYJFF-jIrOc8i6H7A=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270266/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmcGBf"&gt;The Oversight Board set up by Facebook &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/927673894608838-oversight-board-upholds-meta-s-original-decision-case-2021-014-fb-ua/"&gt;issued a decision today&lt;/a&gt; calling on the platform to begin an independent assessment of the platform’s role in heightening the risk of violence in Ethiopia, as part of a more specific ruling on a post that made unfounded claims about Tigrayan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaRE11"&gt;The ruling comes a year into an ongoing civil war between Ethiopian government and rebels in the northern Tigray region of the country, which has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59227672"&gt;created a humanitarian crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has left hundreds of thousands of people facing famine-like conditions and driven millions from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMpiPy"&gt;Facebook has come under fire for its role in the Ethiopian conflict, with observers drawing parallels with the company’s role in the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. There, an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt;online campaign led by Myanmar military personnel&lt;/a&gt; stoked hatred against the Rohingya minority groups and led to acts of mass murder and ethnic cleansing. In Ethiopia, similar rumors and incitements to violence &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbpd7/how-facebook-is-stoking-a-civil-war-in-ethiopia"&gt;have been allowed to proliferate&lt;/a&gt;, despite numerous Facebook employees reportedly raising the alarm within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGgZzN"&gt;Facebook’s lack of action was seemingly acknowledged by the Oversight Board. It recommended that Meta “commission an independent human rights due diligence assessment on how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread hate speech and unverified rumors that heighten the risk of violence in Ethiopia” and add specific guidance around rumors during war and conflict to its Community Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OONXxj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“​​In line with the board’s binding decision we have removed the case content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z0zB2"&gt;“​​In line with the board’s binding decision we have removed the case content,” said Facebook spokesperson Jeffrey Gelman in a statement. “We are reviewing the board’s full decision and recommendations, and per the bylaws, we will respond within 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUwIlb"&gt;The content at the heart of the decision was a post in Amharic that was uploaded to the platform in July 2021 and claimed without evidence that the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) had killed and raped women and children in the Ethiopian Amhara region with the assistance of Tigrayan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWlohG"&gt;After the post was flagged by automated language detection systems, an initial decision was made by a human moderator to remove it. The user who had posted the content appealed the decision, but a second content moderator confirmed that it violated Facebook’s Community Standards. The user then submitted an appeal to the Oversight Board, which agreed to review the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmJUzg"&gt;Ultimately, the Board found that the content violated Facebook’s Community Standard on Violence and Incitement, and it confirmed that the decision to remove it was correct. The Board also criticized Meta’s choice to restore the content in the time before a final decision was made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android Go reaches 200 million daily users just in time for Android 12 update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yn7gFv8lsWlsZtD3A1evFGpj1EQ=/222x0:3822x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270195/android12_go_edition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CprF08"&gt;Android Go, the lightweight version of the full-featured OS, has officially reached &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-12-go-edition/"&gt;over 200 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16736260/google-android-oreo-go-edition"&gt;first launched Android Go in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, offering a smoother Android experience for users on entry-level devices with 2GB of RAM or less.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIbIqvAnB0kFGvWJkWFp--KU69Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087202/android_12_go_speed.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apps on Android 12 (Go edition) open 30 percent faster.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GZ6AOl"&gt;Now, Google has also announced that some of these affordable devices will receive an update to Android 12 (Go edition), bringing a host of features from the standard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;newly released Android 12&lt;/a&gt; to more devices. Most notably, phones with Android 12 (Go edition) will open apps up to 30 percent faster and with smoother animation. Google says that apps will open without delay, eliminating the short period in which you might see a blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxE6Tn"&gt;Other features, like the privacy dashboard, are already available in the standard version of Android 12, letting you view and access your app permissions from one hub. You might also recognize the on-screen translation tool, automatic app hibernation that helps conserve your phone’s battery life, along with the handy feature that lets you share an app with nearby devices, preventing other users from having to use data to download it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmAYJl"&gt;Right now, it’s still unclear which devices will get the Android 12 (Go edition) update or when exactly the update will be rolled out. Google says it’s slated for 2022 but has yet to pinpoint a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap launches Story Studio, a standalone video editing app for mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBCr_L6oTWwBrKLxiXfi5Fd_pOA=/0x0:1967x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270100/snap_story_studio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Promo images of Snap’s Story Studio. | Images: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C27Ktl"&gt;Snap has launched a standalone video editing app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/story-studio/id1566585014"&gt;Story Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to give creators more precise editing control over vertical videos and allow them to add elements like text, trending audio, and AR lenses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445373/snap-ios-story-studio-app-video-edit-app-spotlight"&gt;First announced&lt;/a&gt; in May, the app is now available as an “early version” to iOS users in the US, UK, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19GTj2"&gt;Story Studio, which Snap says is being “built alongside creators,” is meant to be a more advanced video editing tool, like for creators using Spotlight. Launched a year ago, Spotlight is Snap’s response to TikTok — videos edited in Story Studio can be exported directly to Spotlight or a user’s Snapchat story. Videos can be downloaded and shared on other platforms, and they aren’t watermarked, unlike TikToks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Us4lu"&gt;Snap also announced that since the launch of Spotlight last November, the company has paid out more than $250 million to 12,000 creators. The company says it’s paying millions per month to users with top performing Spotlight submissions but did not specify an exact number. Snap says it will continue to offer a “range of opportunities” to reward popular creators but didn’t say whether the millions in payments per month would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WUfHw"&gt;Snap still faces stiff competition in the mobile video space from TikTok and Instagram Reels, and Facebook said in July it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;will pay out $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; through 2022. Though Snap says that Spotlight creators are posting three times as often as they were when the feature was announced, it’s still a relatively new product, and it’s up against behemoths like TikTok with 1 billion monthly users. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Army is in hot water over TikTok recruiting activity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kIlvE34OLHPBSfk_vdBFMwgYrg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270063/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CnG5Ad"&gt;The US Army is facing pressure from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) after &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/rubio-urges-army-to-enforce-ban-of-tiktok-for-recruitment"&gt;recruiters were caught using TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to find leads on young Americans to enlist, despite orders banning the app’s use on government devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUxn13"&gt;Issued on Monday to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, Rubio’s letter comes in response to &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/11/army-recruiters-tiktok-dance-around-ban-reach-gen-z/186935/"&gt;a recent report from &lt;em&gt;Nextgov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing how recruiters struggle to reach young adults online. The report detailed how many Army recruiters are ignoring the military’s TikTok ban, often using their own personal devices to create videos and reach out to young users to find enlistment leads. Some recruiters, like @njrecruiter, tout nearly 500,000 followers on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9EC54"&gt;In his letter, Rubio pressures Wormuth to take additional enforcement actions, citing possible threats posed by the app’s use due to its alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHGv2i"&gt;“Armed with biometric and other personal data, the CCP is able to track, monitor, and collect information on Americans anywhere in the world,” Rubio wrote. “From a military perspective, it can track troop movements, build source networks, or compile biographic profiles on military members for purposes of intelligence collection, exploitation, and manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Ldy1"&gt;Rubio also asks Wormuth to disclose how many Army recruiters use their personal devices for recruitment purposes and whether the Army has any protocols for ensuring soldiers do not download or use TikTok in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3dMu9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21044559/us-army-bans-soldiers-from-using-tiktok"&gt;The Army first banned the use of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019, but recruiters continue to use the app. Rubio also highlighted accounts like @njrecruiter, writing “I urge you to take decisive action to immediately end this practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ZWZE"&gt;The Army’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 is $50 off and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 hits a new low price</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQWZIa"&gt;It can be a little anxiety-inducing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;shop for holiday tech gifts&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of December. Black Friday and its deals feel like a long-forgotten tale of folklore, and there is only so much time remaining to make the purchase, get it, wrap it, and place it under the tree. But we’re always finding you the best deals each and every day, and today we have some great ones for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQAUIY"&gt;Starting off, the Apple Watch Series 7 has hit a new all-time low price this week. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F129685296%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578187165&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fq%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26redirectQuery%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have a selection of Series 7 smartwatches for $50 off, including the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;base 41mm and 45mm aluminum models with GPS&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-aluminum-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84736575%3Fpreselect%3D77640216%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;cellular-equipped counterparts&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640147%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;the stainless steel model&lt;/a&gt;. Each one is $50 off, and that brings the base model &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;41mm Series 7 down to a new low of about $350&lt;/a&gt;. The previous lowest price was only a $20 discount, so this is a prime opportunity to get Apple’s latest watch with a larger, edge-to-edge display until the deal ends on December 18th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thvhUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmLlQN"&gt;If you’re on a tighter budget, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F328828651%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578181648&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-se%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_2926746%3Fq%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26redirectQuery%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have various Apple Watch SE configurations for $50 off. The base &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D77640223%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;40mm aluminum version with GPS is now just $229.99&lt;/a&gt; — not its lowest price ever like its Series 7 counterpart, but the SE contains much of the innards from the previous flagship Series 6 at a much friendlier price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wpmPME"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUeq5"&gt;Now, for another all-time great deal that Android fans can actually enjoy, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097CNBDX2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 has hit a new low price of $1,349.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is this deal $150 better than its previous lowest cost, but it also comes with a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2. Be sure to check the extra savings or special offer lines on the Amazon listing, and click the dedicated button to add both to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0mkqI"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest flagship foldable, with a 6.2-inch outer screen and unfolding 7.6-inch inner display. While the Fold line first came to market with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;easily breakable and flawed design&lt;/a&gt;, it has now developed into something &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Dieter Bohn called “nearly normal” — which is high praise when you think about a smartphone with a screen you fold up and put in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7jnw8"&gt;Today’s deal brings the price down by a whole $450 for any of the color options in its 256GB storage configuration. If you want to be the most unique kid on your block by using a foldable phone, this price is as good as it gets for the phone-unfolds-into-small-tablet form factor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="925RjI"&gt;While those prior deals can be a bit polarizing if you only use iPhones or you only use Android, here is one that everyone can enjoy. Woot currently has some &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeries7121421/https://tools.woot.com/plus/meross-smart-home-products-7?ref=w_cnt_cdet_tool_dly_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exceptional deals on a couple of Meross smart home products&lt;/a&gt;, including a three-way smart dimmer switch kit for interior lighting and a garage door opener remote for easy access to your car hole, regardless of your location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqJ1IF"&gt;Meross is a solid choice for budget-friendly HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter isn’t here to save us from smart home complexity just yet&lt;/a&gt;, this garage door opener is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings. All you need is your smartphone to let yourself, or someone else while you’re away, into your garage. It’s normally priced at $49.99, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeriesSale121421/https://tools.woot.com/offers/meross-smart-garage-door-opener-remote-2?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has it for just $35&lt;/a&gt;. This discount runs until December 18th, and the units are in new condition with a full one-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6sZ7yT"&gt;From the smart home to the TV streaming front, few set-tops have the loyal fan base of the Nvidia Shield TV line, thanks to its fast performance and flexible compatibility with apps like Plex. The newer Nvidia Shield TV Pro is the higher-end model over its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;tube-shaped sibling&lt;/a&gt;, running Android TV and compatible with all the major streaming apps. It looks a lot like the older model from 2015, but it packs a faster Tegra X1 Plus processor and supports Dolby Vision HDR. All of these improvements come at a bit of a cost, but you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YP9FBMM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro for $20 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to $179.99. If you don’t mind splurging for a TV streaming device that’s faster and more capable, saving money on the Shield TV Pro is a great option and solid alternative to the Apple TV 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VMOtnp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10919342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It was set to expire when the clock struck midnight, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcNuuACJ1V" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is still offering the excellent laptop for just $799.99&lt;/a&gt; — a discount of $200. I don’t mind that Best Buy made me a liar on this one, because it means you still get to buy the machine we named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the lowest price possible. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="M7e7xO"&gt;Some more deals for your attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KsFdCa"&gt;The wired version of the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset is at an all-time low price of $59 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SAYCXWG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcN3mlvyJH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in the red colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the wireless version here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DrWc3m"&gt;The 15.6-inch Dell G15 is a sleeper hit of a gaming laptop, and you can get it with an Intel Core i5-11400H processor, 8GB of RAM, and RTX 3050 GPU for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-G15-5511-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B0979CMH5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$849.99 ($200 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYExwM"&gt;Amazon also has the newest 24-inch Apple iMac with M1 processor and upgraded eight-core GPU for $100 off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09326G4R1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bringing it down to $1,399&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HTE07p"&gt;The Facebook Portal with a 10-inch display for video calling is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B07XPDYRRJ?th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white, dropping the price to just $79. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B09FYJFP5Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal Plus with 14-inch display is $299&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off) and the portable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B09FYH2511?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal Go is $149&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off). Prefer to use your TV as the display? The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B07XPLJ9TZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal TV is just $79&lt;/a&gt; ($70 off). That’s a whole lot of Facebook calling, so you have no excuse not giving mom or dad a call around the holidays. Unless, of course, there are &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Facebook-related reasons not to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Nicolas Cage takes on his most challenging role yet: Nicolas Cage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vtzn9Egdvb1tCROeGnp4DJAcXXo=/176x0:859x455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269963/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_11.56.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3XLe"&gt;Do you ever watch a Nicolas Cage movie and think, “He just wasn’t Nick Cage enough for me”? Well, that shouldn’t be a problem in &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming movie in which Cage plays himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xHqht"&gt;It’s described as an “action-adventure,” and the premise is something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UQwFKB"&gt;Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2bq2m"&gt;The first teaser looks appropriately ridiculous, with Cage hamming it up in the best way, seemingly very much in on the joke. It kind of makes me want to watch &lt;em&gt;The Croods 2 &lt;/em&gt;— and maybe even revisit&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260020/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-sundance-nic-cage-sion-sono"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The movie is coming to theaters on April 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad adds magnets to its Base Station wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-NCiB5ih0nq1SmsE7K1Go1l4fw=/0x0:5899x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269880/856500018928_Lifestyle_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad Base Station Hub with magnetic alignment&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D1pWM"&gt;Nomad is updating its line of wireless chargers with the latest version of the Base Station Hub. A multi-device charger that can wirelessly charge up to two devices at the same time, plus charge two more devices through its USB ports, the new Base Station Hub now has embedded magnets to help align devices in the right spot on the pad. The new Hub costs $119.95 and is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for purchase starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMjCHA"&gt;Aside from the magnets, the new Hub is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s prior version&lt;/a&gt;. It has three charging coils under a leather pad that are each capable of up to 10W charging (iPhones will be limited to 7.5W). On the back of the charger is an 18W USB-C port and a 7.5W USB-A port for other devices. Nomad also sells an attachment that affixes to the back of the Hub and holds an Apple Watch charger (not included) that you plug into one of the USB ports on the back or a separate brick. It’s less elegant than the multi-device chargers that have Apple Watch chargers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BAkh"&gt;The biggest challenge with wireless charging pads is making sure your phone or device is put in the right place to actually charge. That’s where the magnets in the new Hub come in: they make it easy to tell when your compatible iPhone (12 or newer), AirPods, or even a Google Pixel 6 is in the right spot to charge efficiently. The magnets are not as strong as those in Apple’s MagSafe charger or most MagSafe accessories — they aren’t designed to hold your phone in place if an earthquake happens. But they do noticeably attach and align the phone in the right place when you put it down, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Base Station Hub’s leather pad are three charging coils surrounded by magnets, which help align compatible devices so they charge efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="11PnIJ"&gt;The Base Station Hub is not as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Nomad’s old Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which used a complex array of charging coils and was meant to let you just plop your phone down wherever and have it charge. But that device had significant limitations and compatibility issues with phones that used MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obtjdT"&gt;Ultimately, when it comes to wireless chargers, the most important thing is knowing that your device will charge when you place it down. The new Base Station Hub makes that just a little bit easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp can now preview voice messages before sending them</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjCsng"&gt;WhatsApp has recently released a preview feature for voice messages, letting you check whether your ramblings vaguely make sense before inflicting them on others. The Meta-owned messaging service said that the feature has been slowly rolling out in recent weeks, and that it’s now available across all platforms including iOS, Android, web, and desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n07ZX"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-preview-a-voice-message/?lang=en"&gt;help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, the option to preview a voice message appears after you press the stop button to finish a recording. You can then preview it with the triangular play icon, delete it with the trash can icon, or send it with the send button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AdGHKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re not mistakes, they’re rehearsals. Now you can preview your voice messages before you hit send. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ohnEVrGTvD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ohnEVrGTvD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1470801332118474758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prcahL"&gt;Audio previews are one part of a flurry of new updates that have either been released or are reportedly in development around WhatsApp’s voice message feature. Earlier this year, the service added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/22/whatsapp-beta-gets-playback-speed-options-for-voice-messages/"&gt;adjust the playback speed of voice notes during listening&lt;/a&gt; (perfect for quickly getting through long and rambling messages), and &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-the-ability-to-pause-voice-recordings/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll also soon be possible to pause and resume recording of a voice message. We’ve been able to verify that the latter feature is available in the beta version of WhatsApp for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43IJUe"&gt;But more interesting features may be on the horizon. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671185/whatsapp-voice-notes-transcription-ios"&gt;WhatsApp confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was in the early stages of developing a new voice transcription feature that could one day allow you to read a transcription of a voice message rather than listening to it. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-a-global-voice-message-player/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had also found signs of a “global voice message player” feature that would let users listen to voice notes while browsing other WhatsApp chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Cq9G1"&gt;There’s no information available as to when (or even if, in some cases) WhatsApp may roll out these new voice message features. But being able to preview a voice note before sending it is a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;
