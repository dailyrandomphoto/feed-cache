    <title>TikTok’s Fire TV app is available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iWrLII"&gt;TikTok is making its way to Fire TVs in the US and Canada, &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/tiktok-now-available-on-amazon-fire-tv-in-u-s-and-canada-afc62bf2977d"&gt;according to a blog post from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This comes just four months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;TikTok launched a Fire TV app in the UK, France, and Germany&lt;/a&gt; — a TikTok representative confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the US version is the same. Once you download TikTok from the Amazon Appstore, you can open the app by simply saying, “Alexa, open TikTok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hmw4pG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIPRWeVufv4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzKjiQ"&gt;Unlike the existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;More on TikTok Fire TV app&lt;/a&gt;, which limited viewing to a curated selection of videos, this newly launched app functions just like TikTok on mobile. You can sign in or create an account and begin exploring the For You, Following, and the Discover pages just as you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2FaEU"&gt;The app has an AutoPlay feature that allows you to play a continuous stream of videos. You can even use your voice to control videos and use commands like “play” and “pause” with the Alexa Voice Remote. Amazon also notes that the TikTok app is “coming soon” to Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqwv2j"&gt;The Fire TV isn’t the only smart TV that you can watch TikTok on, but it’s the only one in the US — up until now, TikTok was only available as an app for smart TVs in Europe. Last December, TikTok rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;an app for Samsung smart TVs in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;later announced its rollout on Android TVs&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, France, and Germany. Just this October, TikTok said that it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716017/tiktok-lg-webos-smart-tv-app-2020-2021-2019"&gt;coming to LG’s newer smart TV models&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, France, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available from Walmart at 3PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIV5Tj6iVDIqYuSz-Hj4pHWRF4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075550/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WCirms"&gt;If you haven’t been able to secure Sony or Microsoft’s latest consoles yet, this might be your chance. Today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, Walmart will be selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleRestock11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleRestock11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the disc-less Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleRestock11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the kind of big restock event that’s becoming increasingly rare as we get closer to the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAJ2nb"&gt;You may know the drill at this point, but while it’s usually first come, first served, the key is to be persistent and keep trying even if you get an error somewhere along the way or encounter an “out of stock” message. Since Walmart’s redesign a few months ago, restock events have been a little on the wonky side, so just keep trying. Though, it still tends to release new waves of stock every 10 minutes, so don’t give up hope if you strike out once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeYksO"&gt;To prepare, be sure to log in to your account ahead of time and add or update your billing and shipping info, which will help you save time during the checkout process. Anything you can do ahead of time to reduce the friction and decrease the times it takes at checkout is worth considering. To that point, we also suggest that you log in and enter your credentials in the Walmart mobile app beforehand, which may increase your odds of securing a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUBuy"&gt;Starting first with the consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp20Qz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="grcrxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gdCyAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LH4Kwf"&gt;The consoles may be the main course, but don’t forget to order some extra sides for when you have company over. Here are a few accessories to consider for both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLE0CZ"&gt;For PlayStation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="kfhO60"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="GELg3N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T46xYf"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Project Kuiper hopes to launch first two prototype satellites in late 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5nFHBqyGRG2GLVVmosLJYr-UVk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075040/Kuiper_ABL_Wide_291021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of ABL Space System’ RS1 rocket with Amazon’s prototype satellites on board&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ABL Space Systems&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1m4x9"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite-internet project, Project Kuiper, aims to launch its first two prototype satellites in the fourth quarter of 2022, &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=285359&amp;amp;x="&gt;according to an experimental launch license&lt;/a&gt; the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission today. Called KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2, the two prototypes are supposed to launch on an experimental new rocket called the RS1, currently being developed by startup ABL Space Systems based in El Segundo, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onMjAC"&gt;Kuiper’s goal is to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;a giant constellation of up to 3,236 satellites&lt;/a&gt; into low Earth orbit over the next decade in order to provide low-latency broadband internet coverage to the surface below. The plan is to serve rural communities and other areas where it’s difficult to provide infrastructure for traditional internet services. It’s a similar concept to that of Starlink, SpaceX’s broadband internet satellite constellation, which proposes sending nearly 12,000 into low orbit around Earth. But unlike Kuiper, Spacex has actually launched more than 1,700 of its satellites and even created a beta program for hundreds of users. Kuiper has yet to launch any satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BRLOff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Amazon subsidiary seems almost ready to get started&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="csVr14"&gt;Now, the Amazon subsidiary seems almost ready to get started. Last week, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1453061006293360651?s=20"&gt;showed off testing of the thrusters&lt;/a&gt; the satellites will use to maneuver through space. And Kuiper claims that these first prototypes will allow the company to test out the same “communication and networking technology” that will be included in the finalized satellites. The two prototypes will operate at 366 miles, or 590 kilometers, above Earth. KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 will house plenty of the same technology needed for the final constellation, including antennas, modems, and power and propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBi4hyM7sZvmyo_fXeXRdflOBww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22975835/KuiperSat_Test_Sequence__1920x1080p.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Project Kuiper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An infographic explaining how the testing will work when the satellites are in space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RiLr2D"&gt;While in space, the satellites will be used to test out their ability to connect with four of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;Kuiper’s user terminals&lt;/a&gt; and a ground station in McCulloch, Texas, designed to send and receive broadband signals from the spacecraft. The entire test sequence is set to last just 10 minutes as each satellite passes overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVuahR"&gt;“There is no substitute for on-orbit testing, and we expect to learn a lot given the complexity and risk of operating in such a challenging environment,” Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, said in a statement. “We can’t wait to get started.” So far, Kuiper says it has done some testing on the ground with its user terminals, claiming to get maximum throughput speeds of up to 400 Mbps. Starlink’s beta program touts download speeds up to 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vrltPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kuiper’s choice to fly its first two prototypes on ABL’s RS1 rocket is an unexpected one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBQHUy"&gt;Kuiper’s choice to fly its first two prototypes on ABL’s RS1 rocket is an unexpected one. In April, the company announced that it had purchased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;nine flights of the United Launch Alliance’s workhorse Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; in order to launch batches of Kuiper satellites. Meanwhile, ABL has yet to actually launch one of its rockets. The company says it’s aiming to conduct its &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/abl-space-systems-raises-200-million/"&gt;first test launch with the RS1 before the end of the year out of Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. Kuiper says it’s been “impressed by ABL’s unique capabilities, rapid development progress, and dedication to customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-announces-plans-and-launch-provider-for-prototype-satellites"&gt;according to a blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. ABL’s RS1 rocket will have the capability to launch &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/rocket-builder-abl-space-raises-200-million-at-2point4-billion-valuation.html"&gt;roughly 1.5 tons of payload to low Earth orbit at approximately $12 million per flight&lt;/a&gt;, which Kuiper claims is the “right capacity and cost-efficiency to support our mission profile.” An Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the smaller RS1 is more appropriate for the launch of two satellites, while Kuiper plans to use the Atlas V rockets to deploy the full constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuBLiB"&gt;Along with today’s news, Kuiper is also trying to reassure the space community that the company will attempt to mitigate any harmful effects of its satellites. One big criticism of proposed mega-constellations like Kuiper and Starlink is that they will lead to a much more crowded environment in low Earth orbit, increasing the likelihood of in-space collisions and making it more difficult to launch satellites in the future. Kuiper says it will take its prototype satellites out of orbit when it’s done testing them by plunging them into Earth’s atmosphere, where they’ll burn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOf52W"&gt;Kuiper also says it’s been “working with astronomers and others in the industry to reduce the visibility of Kuiper System satellites.” Astronomers have raised concerns about the rise of satellite mega-constellations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;as the influx of bright satellites will lead to more disruption of observations of the night sky&lt;/a&gt;. To help dampen the brightness of its satellites, Kuiper is including a sunshade on one of the two prototypes to lessen its ability to reflect light from the Sun. “We will collect data to compare reflectivity between the two spacecraft and share any learnings with the astronomy community following the mission,” Kuiper wrote in its blog post. SpaceX has also launched &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/foust-forward-the-sky-isnt-falling-yet/"&gt;more than 1,000 of its satellites with sunshades&lt;/a&gt;, or visors, to dampen their brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZp4mh"&gt;This latest announcement from Kuiper comes a week after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745637/amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-verizon-partnership-5g-cellular-backhaul"&gt;announced a partnership with Verizon&lt;/a&gt; to expand the carrier’s 4G / LTE and 5G coverage to more underserved areas. Such a deal relies on Kuiper launching its satellites first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uFyWj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXDp8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s deal with NBCUniversal brings audio from The Office, SNL, Shrek, and more to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snapchat NBCUniversal sounds" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL48rfnGotXLbKDc0hrVJu9mLlc=/301x0:3540x2159/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074592/Snapchat_Sounds_x_NBCU.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfThNe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/nbcuniversal-sounds"&gt;Snapchat’s newly signed deal with NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt; will bring audio from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;, and more to the platform (via &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-snl-1235039596/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Users can add the audio clips to their snaps — just like TikTok — and then send them to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y16p5l"&gt;Anyone who receives a clip with audio from an NBC title can swipe up to view more information about the content. Tapping the Play This Sound button will show users which streaming services they can use to watch the show or movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2VzER"&gt;Ben Schwerin, Snapchat’s senior vice president of content and partnerships, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;: “NBCUniversal has an iconic catalog and we know Snapchatters will love adding quotes from their favorite movies and series to their Snaps to help perfectly express the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LYAsM"&gt;In October of last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Snapchat signed deals with Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, and more, allowing users to add music to their snaps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;The platform also rolled out a TikTok-like feature called Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users view a vertical stream of short videos. In addition to paying users for creating the most popular Spotlight clips, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711632/snapchat-spotlight-challenges-announced-cash-prizes-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat also entices creators by adding “challenges” that reward users&lt;/a&gt; who apply select Lenses, participate in certain activities, and use specific sounds in their Spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFfH8L"&gt;Snapchat’s move to expand its audio offerings is likely in response to TikTok’s growing popularity — as of 2021, TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/"&gt;1 billion users&lt;/a&gt;, compared to Snapchat’s user base of just &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/snapchat-statistics/"&gt;293 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YF9Noi"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is letting non-Tesla EVs use its Supercharger network for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FiMXAILIt9krzaqDM4XH8AllXPs=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074590/akrales_160419_1019_A_0257.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TedA5q"&gt;Tesla launched a pilot project in the Netherlands this week in which non-Tesla electric vehicles will be allowed to use its Supercharger network, representing the first time that the automaker is opening up its proprietary charging stations to EVs from other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuMtv"&gt;Tesla’s Supercharger network is often held up as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;best possible example of an EV charging network&lt;/a&gt;: fast, reliable, and plentiful. But Tesla’s network is also exclusive to Tesla owners, meaning someone driving a Volkswagen or Ford EV wouldn’t be able to use it. But that’s now starting to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDaUVr"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, talked about opening up his company’s vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. And over this past summer, he started revealing key details about how it would actually work. Now the company is ready to start the process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/non-tesla-supercharging"&gt;by announcing its first pilot project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="07ViCR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Tesla will open up its Superchargers to other EVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BM4ItG"&gt;Initially, only 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands will be available to non-Tesla EVs. Vehicle owners will need to download the most recent version of Tesla’s smartphone app (version 4.2.3 or higher) in order to access the stations. After downloading the app, customers will be prompted to select “Charge Your Non-Tesla” in order to find the closest participating Supercharger site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmk87"&gt;Tesla owners can still use the stations just as normal. “We will be closely monitoring each site for congestion and listening to customers about their experiences,” the company said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gw5rEW"&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously indicated the experiment would likely start in Europe, where standardized charging cable connectors are mandatory. Other European countries will likely follow before the company opens up its Superchargers in the US. (Tesla has already committed to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/24/tesla-confirms-plan-open-supercharger-network-other-automakers-next-year/"&gt;opening up the network in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZbyNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIftvv"&gt;Tesla uses a proprietary connector in North America, so non-Tesla vehicles here will need an adapter in order to access the company’s Superchargers, of which there are over 6,400 plugs in the US, &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;ev_connectors=TESLA"&gt;according to the Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKycg"&gt;“It’s always been our ambition to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla EVs and, by doing so, encourage more drivers to go electric,” the company said. “This move directly supports our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlnIzw"&gt;There’s still a lot of pieces that need to fall into place before Superchargers across the globe become available to non-Tesla owners, especially with regard to how much other automakers are willing to spend on adapters for their customers. But the pilot in the Netherlands is an indication that the ball is finally rolling on a key piece in Musk’s stated plans to spur a revolution in EV adoption. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Book of Boba Fett’s first trailer teases the spinoff fans have been waiting for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idqoBPPQ0ndehgnSQlsgLCsmbOM=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074250/06_Boba_Fett_trailer_stills_uhd_t_r709_211010.088651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAj0WH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; just got its first trailer ahead of its debut on Disney Plus on December 29th, giving an initial look at the upcoming spinoff for the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Tcjl"&gt;The spinoff has been a long time coming: Boba Fett has long been one of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’&lt;/em&gt; most popular characters since his introduction (in the otherwise reviled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;). He’s captured the imagination of fans with his action-figure-worthy costume and ice-cold demeanor in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, despite scant minutes of screentime and just four lines of dialogue across the two films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDDypX"&gt;Fett’s character was later expounded upon in subsequent &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; novels, an introductory backstory in the prequels, and eventually, the entire genesis of the fan-favorite Mandalorian culture that’s in turn lead to &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; series. And while there have been rumors for years that Disney was planning to give Boba Fett his own film spinoff, it wasn’t until a post-credit reveal following &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season that the news of the bounty hunter finally getting top billing was revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mlfof8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is set just after that post credit scene, which saw Fett (Temuera Morrison) — aided by fellow bounty hunter Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) — killing Bib Fortuna and reclaiming the palace and territory once held by Jabba the Hutt. The new series appears to follow Fett’s efforts to bring some order to the former crime lord’s holding — presumably without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many disintegrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7KrGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is also just the first of several planned &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs that Disney has in the works for &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookofBoda110121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;; the company is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168619/disney-plus-star-wars-rangers-of-the-new-republic-ahsoka-mandalorian-spinoffs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashoka &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Rangers of the New Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will cross over with the original series in the future in a “climactic story event.” That’s in addition to other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to hit the streaming service in the future, including the&lt;em&gt; Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lando&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Acolyte&lt;/em&gt;, and future seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy an orange Apple HomePod Mini now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoAQwXDhfahOw3348hXpCyTavFo=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074127/apple_minis.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini is now available in three new colors — orange, yellow, and blue — in addition to white and space gray. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/homepod-mini-is-available-in-bold-new-colors-starting-today/"&gt;buy Apple’s HomePod Mini in new colors&lt;/a&gt; yellow, orange, and blue (in addition to the standard white and space gray), and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;the $99.99 devices&lt;/a&gt; are available for in-store pickup today. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced the new colors at its October Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt;, where it unveiled its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEne8p"&gt;It’s also where Apple announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, a cheaper tier of its music streaming service that you access only via the Siri voice assistant, although there will be a limited app option; it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month and will work with the Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAis36"&gt;The new speakers will have the HomePod mini’s tinted touch surface, fabric mesh, volume icons, and power cable, along with color-matched details. Apple’s competitors already have more colorful options for their small home assistant speakers — Google has blue and orange versions of its Nest Mini speaker, and Amazon’s Echo Dot comes in blue and some animal-themed designs for kids— so it seemed like only a matter of time before Apple caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTbuG8"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;order them from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F159302133&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-mini-blue%2F5902427.p%3FskuId%3D5902427&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with pick-ups available as soon as today and delivery dates available for this week, in Canada, Mexico, and the US. In China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan orders are also opening today, while availability is listed as “later this month” for Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luigi’s Mansion expansion sets join Lego’s Super Mario World collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luigi’s Mansion Lego set" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGMPU95XSPaz7BSEDRd31h-Thkk=/0x1:1440x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074187/lego_luigis_mansion_mario.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qZC6Fe"&gt;Just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi joined Lego’s interactive Super Mario World collection&lt;/a&gt;, Lego has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2021%2Foctober%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Luigis-Mansion-Sets&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F1%2F22756073%2Fluigis-mansion-expansion-sets-legos-super-mario-world-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; expansion sets&lt;/a&gt; that give the green-clad plumber the attention he deserves (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-luigis-mansion-set-110023202.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). With the $30 Lab and Poltergust set, you can equip Luigi with a Poltergust and use it to capture the Gold Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vl6upD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuGsLRNS5VI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxUW2O"&gt;The $40 Mansion Entry set lets you step into a haunted mansion, where you’ll encounter Boo as you grab the Golden Bone for Polterpup. Finally, the $80 Haunt-and-Seek set offers an experience that’s just like the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; game — build and wander through a series of rotating hallways filled with ghosts and hidden gems to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Xcrk"&gt;You can attach all three sets for the ultimate ghost-hunting experience, or use each one separately. And although Lego announced the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set on Halloween, it won’t hit the stores until January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCp8f"&gt;Just keep in mind that Luigi actually isn’t included in any of these sets, so you’ll need a Luigi or Mario Starter Course to get started. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Collectible-Creative/dp/B08YPBBRR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luigi Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is currently $60, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Interactive-Featuring/dp/B085878WLK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mario Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is on sale right now for $47.99 on Amazon, down from $60. You can expect to spend $150 for the entire &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set or a total of $210 if you decide to add the Luigi Starter Course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats announces Fit Pro earbuds with wing tip design and $200 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocF-gwmGtLrClQFPhiePrHWRSns=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074042/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaG4LB"&gt;Beats today announced its latest wireless earbuds, the $199.99 Beats Fit Pro. The new product slots into the Apple-owned brand’s lineup between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt;, which were released earlier this year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;. The Fit Pros have active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and up to seven hours of continuous playback (or 30 hours of total listening when you include case recharges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpgqYB"&gt;The most noticeable thing about the new earbuds are the wing tips that are a permanent part of their design. Beats says it did a ton of research and user testing to land on the right material and level of flexibility. The wing tips are intended to help the Fit Pros stay locked in your ears no matter how strenuous your workout routine might be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nmQN76TlgSQxMzVwRK0kdTCUE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22975264/file.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Beats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have flexible, removable wing tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tidHHI"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which lacked Apple’s usual silicon inside, the Fit Pro buds include the H1 chip and thus come with the entire suite of features like one-step pairing, automatic syncing across your iCloud devices, auto switching between Apple hardware products, and more. They also include dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, and Beats even integrated the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r3zqvK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZZB-QSsEFg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlMY1"&gt;The noise cancellation system is essentially the same as what’s on the AirPods Pro, so it should prove rather effective at quieting the outside world. When ANC and transparency mode are both off, the Fit Pro buds still use Apple’s Adaptive EQ to optimize audio performance based on your particular ear shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIOOFO"&gt;Beats will offer the Fit Pro earbuds in four colors: black, white, gray, and purple / pink. Preorders start today and they ship on November 5th. You don’t need to wait long to read the verdict on the latest Beats buds: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517199"&gt;I’ve been testing them for several days now&lt;/a&gt; and have found that they’re the company’s best, most focused product since the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
