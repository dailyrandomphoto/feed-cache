    <title>Yelp will let businesses list their vaccination policies  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pggTfHSC1fNYoS8_56M3aIxUFI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681872/Yelp_Vaccination_Attribute_Filters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users can search via the new attributes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Yelp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYWa98"&gt;Yelp will let businesses share their policies on COVID-19 vaccinations, the company announced today. There are a pair of new attributes businesses can add to their profiles; one to share whether their staff are fully vaccinated, and one to specify whether customers will be required to provide proof of vaccination. Businesses can list the attributes via their Yelp for Business accounts. allowing users of the service to find places with policies they’re most comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5QQZ"&gt;The ability to list vaccination policies joins a long list of pandemic-focused features Yelp has added to its service over the past year. Early on in the pandemic, the service let businesses specify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21187939/yelp-coronavirus-social-distancing-restaurants-nightlife-review-moderation-relief-fund"&gt;whether they offer virtual or contact-free services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21291496/yelp-new-coronavirus-safety-tools-business-owners"&gt;later expanded this&lt;/a&gt; to other safety measures like whether they offer outdoor dining, or have a face masks policy for staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25GouWPOsg3NJoZjvKSjDl1g82E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763052/Yelp_Vaccination_Attributes_via_Yelp_for_Business_App.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses can add the attributes via their Yelp for Business account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmvxY"&gt;But some of Yelp’s attempts to help businesses during the pandemic have been less warmly received. In March last year it was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21196446/yelp-gofundme-coronavirus-automatic-opt-in-fundraiser-pause"&gt;reverse a controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192127/yelp-donation-buttonn-gofundme-local-businesses-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;automatically add fundraisers&lt;/a&gt; to the pages of tens of thousands of small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbVoTZ"&gt;Vaccination policies have become controversial in some circles, so Yelp is also emphasizing the moderation work it does to prevent businesses from being review-bombed as a result of their choices. It says it’s proactively monitoring the pages of businesses that choose to display these policies, and that it will remove reviews that focus on them rather than a customer’s actual experience with a business. Over the course of 2021, Yelp says it’s removed thousands of reviews for violating its COVID Content Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3dTv4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeE1gL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ban of third-party researchers ‘deeply concerning’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Hjobedv0U3NAQFNJfBJs_V_L-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681838/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiAAmt"&gt;Facebook is being criticized by politicians and researchers for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banning the accounts&lt;/a&gt; of academics who analyzed political ads and misinformation on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m7uUZ"&gt;In press statements, Senator Mark R. Warner (D-VA) said the company’s actions were “deeply concerning,” while Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she was “deeply troubled” by the news. Creator of the Firefox browser, Mozilla, which conducted a privacy audit of the academics’ work, said Facebook’s justification for banning the researchers was “wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9ujU6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In our view, those claims simply do not hold water.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yhDOQF"&gt;“Facebook claims the accounts were shut down due to privacy problems with the Ad Observer,” wrote Mozilla’s chief security officer Marshall Erwin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “In our view, those claims simply do not hold water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdQwvi"&gt;The academics banned by Facebook worked with the &lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt;NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, creating a browser plug-in called &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;Ad Observer&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook users could install to collect data about what political ads they were shown and how they were targeted. Facebook does not provide equivalent information, says the NYU Ad Observatory, not least because, as the researchers have shown, the company sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;fails to label political ads&lt;/a&gt; at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II9ZGh"&gt;Facebook has defended its ban of NYU Ad Observatory accounts and pages by saying it’s protecting users’ privacy. It’s a not-unreasonable argument given that the Cambridge Analytica scandal sprung from third-party researchers scraping the site for user data. But critics say Facebook has got the details wrong. Mozilla, which examined the code and consent flow of the Ad Observer plug-in, is adamant that it presents no privacy threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxJNn0"&gt;As Mozilla’s Marshall Erwin &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis his):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qf6YBA"&gt;We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency. It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads.&lt;strong&gt; It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers.&lt;/strong&gt; The extension also allows you to see what data has been collected by visiting the “My Archive” tab. It gives you the choice to opt in to sharing additional demographic information to aid research into how specific groups are being targeted, but even that is off by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qi5GML"&gt;As reported in Casey Newton’s &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-scrapes-some-researchers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook claims the plug-in may collect some information about third-parties. For example: ”If an individual pays to boost a post, such as for a fundraiser, information including that user’s name and photo winds up in the NYU researchers’ hands.” But as Newton notes: “In any of these cases, the actual harm to the user would seem to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; minor, if you can call it a harm at all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSgGUP"&gt;In a statement, Senator Warner said Facebook’s actions were exactly the wrong response to current worries about political ad transparency and misinformation on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaJxYq"&gt;“This latest action by Facebook to cut off an outside group’s transparency efforts — efforts that have repeatedly facilitated revelations of ads violating Facebook’s Terms of Service, ads for frauds and predatory financial schemes, and political ads that were improperly omitted from Facebook’s lackluster Ad Library — is deeply concerning,” said Warner. “For several years now, I have called on social media platforms like Facebook to work with, and better empower, independent researchers, whose efforts consistently improve the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity. Instead, Facebook has seemingly done the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus releases Windows 11-ready BIOS updates with automatic TPM support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBZ6VFqBFzjhTxeIUPyeXZZHji8=/0x1:1682x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681709/asuswindows11biosupdates.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gRdfKK"&gt;Asus is making a range of its motherboards ready for Windows 11. The motherboard manufacturer has released BIOS updates for a variety of chipsets, including ones that support Intel Kaby Lake processors from 2017. Both Intel and AMD chipsets are supported, and these new BIOS updates will even automatically enable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) on AMD and Intel systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBCr2O"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;TPM is a minimum requirement for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a change that caused some confusion after many realized their PCs didn’t have the option enabled in the BIOS, or it was confusingly named “PTT” or “PSP fTPM” in BIOS settings. Microsoft’s Windows 11 upgrade checker didn’t ease that confusion initially, so it’s encouraging to see big manufacturers like Asus now enabling TPM by default so people don’t have to dig around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkAnnb"&gt;While Asus is planning to support a wide range of motherboards for Windows 11, not every BIOS update is available just yet. &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/asus-begins-rolling-out-windows-11-compatible-firmware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has spotted a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fmicrosite%2Fmotherboard%2FASUS-motherboards-Win11-ready%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610869%2Fasus-windows-11-bios-updates-download-tpm-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of Asus motherboards&lt;/a&gt; that are compatible with Windows 11, so you’ll need to check to see if your system has an update waiting for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yGIs6t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"},{"title":"Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Windows 11 is free, but your CPU might not be officially supported ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mOrr9Y"&gt;If you purchased a pre-built PC and you’re not sure of the exact motherboard inside, you should be able to find the model number listed when you navigate to Start &amp;gt; Run &amp;gt; msinfo32 in Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRkqf"&gt;Asus isn’t alone in its motherboard support for Windows 11. &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/1925"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=19151&amp;amp;title=tpm-2-0-support-and-windows-11-intel"&gt;Asrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/news/news.php?S_ID=468"&gt;Biostar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/Introducing-Windows-11-on-MSI-devices"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt; have all released lists of supported systems that will work with Windows 11. It’s still not clear exactly when Windows 11 will be available as a free upgrade to Windows 10 users. Microsoft has only officially said this holiday, but the software maker keeps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;hinting at an October release date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson is writing a book about Elon Musk, says Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xdOO7uAIPsP47VoXgqfFckUun_8=/181x0:2131x1300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681691/elon_wario.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musk has an interesting relationship with his self-image, as evidenced by his appearance on SNL as Wario. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: SNL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngiZwA"&gt;Like most of the super-rich, Elon Musk has one eye on his legacy, keen to shape how his huge fortune is perceived now and in the future. This perhaps explains why he recently shared the fact that Walter Isaacson, biographer of Steve Jobs, is writing a book about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX69b5"&gt;“If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp;amp; my general goings on, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson"&gt;@WalterIsaacson&lt;/a&gt; is writing a biography,” tweeted Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTqGsh"&gt;He added in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423155872524558341"&gt;subsequent tweets&lt;/a&gt; that Isaacson has shadowed Musk “for several days so far,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423136151813050372"&gt;and that&lt;/a&gt; he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s biography of US founding father Benjamin Franklin. He also repeated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423105264010530821"&gt;that he will&lt;/a&gt; “maybe one day” write his own autobiography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4SGOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk says he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s book about Benjamin Franklin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmmV4x"&gt;There have been a number books written about Musk’s life and his career, including a 2015 biography, &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,&lt;/em&gt; by Ashlee Vance. The book, which Musk contributed several interviews to, was well received by reviewers. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10baeaea-ffab-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “a riveting portrait of Silicon Valley’s most driven entrepreneur [...] personal flaws and all,” while &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/books/elon-musk-a-biography-by-ashlee-vance-paints-a-driven-portrait.html"&gt;offered similar praise&lt;/a&gt;, though noted that the work occasionally veered “toward hagiography and the diction of news releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2iD8f"&gt;Musk has been less happy with other books written about him, though, including Tim Higgins’ recent &lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century, &lt;/em&gt;which was published earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmWxfR"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;review from &lt;em&gt;The LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says Higgins’ book “takes the shine off” Musk, showing him to be “a hair trigger of an executive who’s quick to fire people whether they deserve it or not.” The book has generated numerous news stories, including a particularly wild tale that Musk demanded to be made CEO of Apple after the iPhone-maker approached Tesla about an acquisition. Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;both denied that this ever happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwOxr"&gt;With Isaacson, though, Musk will likely know what to expect. Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was written with “unprecedented” access to the Apple founder and praised for its detail, readability, and emotional insight. But, as we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/27/2517152/book-review-steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson"&gt;noted in our own review&lt;/a&gt; from Laura June in 2011, the biography is also “in some respects [...] a book told through the often discussed ‘reality distortion field’ of Steve Jobs himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkFp0h"&gt;“[T]hough other opinions or sides to a story are presented, Steve always has the last, blunt word,” says June of Isaacson’s biography. That sounds like something Musk would like, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden wants half of new cars sold in 2030 to be hybrid or all-electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYfFbhG9on1mizR_sf6xbXNIWe0=/57x0:5064x3338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681656/1232967835.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gq7DU8"&gt;President Biden wants 50 percent of all new cars sold in the United States in 2030 to be all-electric, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen-powered — a goal he will lay out in an executive order later today, according to senior administration officials. In addition, his administration will propose new fuel economy and emissions standards that will more or less erase the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;rollback&lt;/a&gt; of the previous Obama-era rules covering cars made through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwuofZ"&gt;Biden will also sign an executive order that tasks the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop aggressive long-term rules to support his 2030 target, ones that include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOq35a"&gt;“When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking,” read a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627"&gt;tweet from the President on Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LnqGOd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking. Tune in for big news tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/riIClqPYnw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/riIClqPYnw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— President Biden (@POTUS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7KPgD"&gt;This planned shift away from internal combustion engines is not as aggressive as the approaches that have been proposed or set in motion around the world. The European Union has proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;a de-facto ban on sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, though France has pushed back on the phaseout of hybrids, which still use fossil fuels. The United Kingdom wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;stop selling new combustion engine vehicles by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. China &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/27/china-plans-2035-gas-car-ban-that-doesnt-actually-ban-gas-cars/"&gt;wants all new cars sold in 2035&lt;/a&gt; to be hybrids at the very least, but is aiming for 50 percent to be plug-in hybrid, battery electric, or hydrogen-powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="occUb0"&gt;California, ever the leader on state-level environmental regulations, is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to ban new gas cars&lt;/a&gt; by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoXcC8"&gt;On the policy side, the proposed rule from the NHTSA will look to lock in average annual fuel economy increases of just under four percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and an ultimate fleet-wide average of around 52 miles per gallon for 2026 model-year vehicles. Under the Obama-era rule, automakers had to increase the average fuel economy of their fleets by five percent each year, with the goal of hitting a fleet average of 54 miles per gallon in the 2026 model-year cars. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;lowered this dramatically&lt;/a&gt; — during a climate crisis and a respiratory virus pandemic, no less — to yearly increases of just 1.5 percent and a target average of 40 miles per gallon. It did this despite the EPA previously determining that automakers were “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17226192/epa-emissions-standards-old-data-fuel-automakers"&gt;over-complying&lt;/a&gt;” with the Obama-era rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC6QAY"&gt;The EPA, meanwhile, will propose a rule that requires emissions reductions that scale with the proposed fuel economy gains, as fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions are intrinsically linked. The two rule proposals will now go through a months-long public comment process before final rules are proposed and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5TVXu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Big Three Detroit Automakers are on board, mostly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9C7PXq"&gt;The Biden administration’s new proposals have already won support from some major automakers, which will separately announce their own goals for electrifying their fleets later today. Representatives from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (the company that was created when Fiat Chrysler merged with France’s PSA group) will appear alongside Biden as he announces the executive orders and proposed rules, as will leaders of the United Auto Workers union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiKaRc"&gt;That said, as was reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;those three Detroit automakers are only committing to a “shared aspiration” of 40 to 50 percent of new car sales being plug-ins by 2030. They’re also asking for the government to pitch in big time, not just on incentives for new electric vehicles, but also “incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States,” according to a press release. The Biden administration has been pushing to support electric vehicle adoption in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;the bipartisan infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, though some proposed investments (like for charging stations) have already been cut back in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CMuKE"&gt;GM has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;be carbon neutral by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and that eliminating tailpipe emissions from its vehicles by 2035 is merely an “aspiration.” Ford, which has found early success with the Mustang Mach-E, has committed to going all-electric by 2030 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker plans to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;40 percent of its fleet all-electric by that year&lt;/a&gt; globally. Stellantis had previously said more than 40 percent of its North American sales in 2030 &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/stellantis-ev-plans/"&gt;would be plug-in vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjurNO"&gt;While the Detroit automakers have announced massive investments in electric vehicles, they were certainly not as united on policy during the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjBYca"&gt;After the EPA and NHTSA moved to roll back the Obama-era standards under Trump, Ford (as well as Volkswagen, Honda, BMW, and Volvo) struck a deal with California to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;keep aiming at a relatively strict target&lt;/a&gt;. GM and what was still Fiat Chrysler at the time, meanwhile, actually joined the Trump administration’s fight in court over California’s right to set its own emissions standards. The automakers (along with Toyota) have maintained that they joined the court bid because they believed it should be up to the federal government to set these types of standards. But they have since abandoned that fight — GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;just after the 2020 election&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2021/02/02/fiat-chrysler-toyota-dump-trump-california-fight/4357446001/"&gt;Stellantis earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Biden’s EPA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;already moved to restore California’s emissions regulation authority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ks6aXJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is investing billions in EVs but sided with Trump before last year’s election &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xo7i6b"&gt;All-electric vehicles currently only make up about &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/"&gt;two percent of total sales in the US&lt;/a&gt;, though they’ve jumped sharply in recent months as the new and used car markets have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;gotten red hot&lt;/a&gt;. More than 100,000 fully electric vehicles were sold in the US in the second quarter of 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/electrified-vehicle-sales-accelerate-in-q2/"&gt;Kelley Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, driven in large part by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;success of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV&lt;/a&gt;. But hybrid vehicle sales were up, too, with more than 250,000 sold — a 200-percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84tcSj"&gt;In some respects, Tesla is already the kind of automaker that the Biden administration wants others to evolve into. Tesla only makes electric vehicles, and CEO Elon Musk’s penchant for vertical integration means Tesla’s cars are built out of an &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/23/tesla-top-3-most-american-made-cars/"&gt;exceptionally high amount of American-made parts&lt;/a&gt;. But the company won’t be part of Thursday’s event. “[S]eems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423156475799683075"&gt;tweeted early Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1RUFD"&gt;Biden is likely to speak Thursday about wanting electric vehicles to be made by union workers, though, and Tesla has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351157/tesla-elon-musk-delete-anti-union-tweet-national-labor-relations-board"&gt;famously pushed back on unionization efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Other all-electric vehicle startups are moving forward towards production without union workforces, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22406064/uaw-union-rivian-lucid-motors-faraday-future-lordstown-labor"&gt;UAW has said it’s already planning to try to change that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVwgsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 8:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added info about Elon Musk’s tweet and other EV startups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo profits decline year-on-year as Switch hits 89 million sold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kvkkg6ZtST_5x51GN6u6_8e6h74=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681638/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kM5x0e"&gt;Nintendo has released its earnings for the April-June quarter, and while the figures would normally be strong for what’s usually a slow period, revenue and profit are both down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356750/nintendo-earnings-q1-2020-switch-animal-crossing-sales"&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. That’s perhaps not surprising given the company was then riding a surge in demand for video games during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and had just released the mega-hit &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58WzGM"&gt;By comparison, Switch hardware sales were down 21.7 percent to 4.45 million units, and software sales decreased 10.2 percent to 45.29 million units. Nintendo has now sold 89.04 million Switch consoles in total; for comparison, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;just hit 10 million&lt;/a&gt;. Revenue decreased 9.9 percent to 322.6 billion yen ($2.94 billion), while operating profit was 119.6 billion yen ($1.09 billion), a 17.3-percent decline year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s now sold nearly 34 million copies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l1MRj"&gt;Nintendo’s biggest release this current quarter is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which came out last month. The company can expect a boost in Switch hardware sales next quarter due to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;new OLED model&lt;/a&gt; in October, even though it isn’t bringing the widely expected upgrade in power. Nintendo’s slate of games for that all-important holiday quarter includes &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, and remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines will let you watch 30 minutes of TikTok in the air for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airfield At Miami International Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TlDp_ZUENTpTBOyZ58ZSzQeHdg=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680846/1323904371.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGSpgm"&gt;Free TikTok has arrived on some of American Airlines’ flights, according to &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Passengers will be able to use the app for up to 30 minutes for free, which gives them time to watch at least ten of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;new, longer TikToks&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have the app already installed, the airline says you’ll be able to download it for free while in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gHbI"&gt;The move to make TikTok available to travelers comes as airlines are trying to get attention back on flying, after the &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/march-2021-airline-passenger-volume-shows-signs-aviation-recovery"&gt;number of people traveling&lt;/a&gt; by air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;dropped during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. One of its competitors, United, has also been adding tech upgrades to its fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596430/united-airlines-preorder-food-drink-website-app"&gt;allowing passengers to pre-order in-flight snacks&lt;/a&gt; and adding planes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;support bluetooth audio for the in-seat screens&lt;/a&gt;. American has &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2020/12/16/american-airlines-to-offer-free-inflight-messaging-and-new-priority-boarding-perks/"&gt;recently allowed passengers to use Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; for free in-flight, giving them at least some connection to the outside world — something that some of its competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16375474/delta-free-in-flight-messaging-whatsapp-imessage-facebook-planes-gogo"&gt;have done for years&lt;/a&gt; for it and other messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3cFsL"&gt;According to the airline’s press release, the promotion is a “trial.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that customer response will determine how long the trial will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peD9CB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline suggests TikToks about travel and finance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJKNh"&gt;If you’re planning your flights around free TikTok, it’s probably worth keeping in mind that it doesn’t seem like every flight will have access to it. American Airlines specifies that the promotional offer is limited to narrow-body aircraft that have Viasat Wi-Fi systems. A lot of planes in &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/planes/planes.jsp"&gt;the airline’s fleet&lt;/a&gt; seem to count as narrow-body, but planes like the Boeing 787 &lt;a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/widebody/"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. American also uses &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/entertainment/wi-fi-and-connectivity.jsp"&gt;a few Wi-Fi providers for its flights&lt;/a&gt;, so even if a flight has Wi-Fi there’s a chance it won’t be from Viasat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUy2wE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;airline’s press release&lt;/a&gt; tells its passengers that they can expect to find a ton of content on the platform, including “travel inspiration” and “career advice.” While it’s hard to imagine many people sitting on a plane watching TikToks about how to make a resumé, spending a half hour looking up short videos about wherever you’re going isn’t actually the worst idea. Let’s just hope that your time isn’t eaten up by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610175/amazon-tiktok-fake-ad-flo-rida-low-roblox-apple-bottom-jeans"&gt;bizarre fake ads with Flo Rida songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Draw like it’s 1989 with this Kid Pix web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4aEg4mzod4J2sK3tu2QmiVWMAaA=/45x0:1212x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680744/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.18.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rSr7iX"&gt;Kid Pix, an iconic piece of kid-friendly desktop art software, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000/status/1423014244644122627"&gt;has been ported to Javascript and HTML&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000"&gt;Vikrum Nijjar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;The web version of Kid Pix&lt;/a&gt; is based one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix#Kid_Pix_5:_The_S.T.E.A.M._Edition"&gt;the original 1.0 version released for Macs in 1989&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Kixm8"&gt;It has the expected tools like paint brushes, rubber stamps, shapes, and letters, all scored by Kid Pix’s highly memorable sound effects. The sounds and Kid Pix’s somewhat inscrutable interface are the real draw here. The program’s inherent playfulness encourages you to explore, even if you’re not a kid anymore. You can see a spokesperson from Kid Pix’s first publisher Broderbund &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TayProAkmBE"&gt;talk through some of the original app’s features&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rRjjlG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TayProAkmBE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6D1qw9"&gt;I didn’t remember using Kid Pix at first, but pulling up the web version of Kid Pix and stamping a random assortment of strawberries only to be greeted with the app’s distinct THWACK sound effect, immediately confirmed that yes, I am child of the 90s. You might be similarly stirred by the dull KABOOM paired with Kid Pix’s “Firecracker” tool. Or the bizarre WOOOW that accompanies the “Doorbell” tool. Kid Pix is refreshingly weird in a way that most software isn’t in our polished, user-friendly 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0fb5ZKdwh5ZJrMCCvleJZgwN1J0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762429/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.09.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some casual Kid Pix art can be quite good, in my opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ob8CDg"&gt;It’s fun to take a trip down memory lane, and loading up a website in your browser is a lot easier than digging up a version of Kid Pix that will actually run on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YvEEg"&gt;You can try Kid Pix now, &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;right from your browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 may give the iPhone’s camera an upgrade: fewer green flares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1EEmaRhJrnLZ3NJ4cvReKzmsJg=/0x199:2388x1791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680500/IMG_2220.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtVSH9"&gt;The latest version of Apple’s iOS 15 beta seems to be making subtle improvements to photos by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor pictures (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). News of the feature was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted to the iOSBeta subreddit&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit user Doubleluckstur, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to see it in action by testing with an iPhone 12 Mini running the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xNJPR"&gt;Many iPhone users will be familiar with the green blobs, and while taking a picture it seems like nothing’s changed — the flare still shows up in the viewfinder. But when you go to view the final picture, the flare is nowhere to be seen (in some cases; we’ll get to that in a bit). It does seem to be the result of all the post-processing that’s done to the picture, as the flare shows up in the alternate (and less-processed) frames that are available if you’re using Apple’s Live Photo feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxjdgr8cE301KrCX9jJufRFYiWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762173/RPReplay_Final1628109977_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green dot shows up in the viewfinder and Live Photo, but not the processed still.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="AsRhIt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10686247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYq911"&gt;So far it’s a bit unclear which iPhone models the processing happens on. In the Reddit thread, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7mecjl?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one user reports&lt;/a&gt; also seeing the green dot removal on their iPhone XS, while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7ohj3r?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;another says&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t work on their iPhone 8 Plus. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the feature could be limited to phones with an A12 Bionic processor or newer (so the XS and XR onward). The feature only being available on newer phones wouldn’t necessarily be surprising: some of iOS 15’s features, like Live Text or Portrait mode for FaceTime, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;already have the A12 Bionic listed as a requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCaB9M"&gt;Of course, with this discovery came people trying to chase it down and find its limitations. Reddit user -DementedAvenger- &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7lopz8?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted examples of the flare still showing up&lt;/a&gt; on top of trees or mesh bug-proof window screens, as well as flares that came from a bathroom light instead of the sun. I was also able to replicate his tree example, as well as get some indoor flares of my own (though it’s worth noting that they’re not the same green bubble flares that so often occur from the sun).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hZxs_ku6WSu6_mljI9EFsGlbqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762112/IMG_2212.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get flares if you’re really trying, especially indoors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgXtxl0S2tqx2T5xF7vvSu3o7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762119/IMG_2215.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the flare on the right side of the tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOvsrd"&gt;Another limitation is video: I couldn’t find any scenarios where flares showed up any differently in the final video than they did in the viewfinder. Of course, removing a lens flare from 30 or 60 frames per second 4K footage would be quite a bit more computationally intensive, and have a greater chance of looking a bit weird, so it’s not necessarily surprising that the feature seems to be photo-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GK_C-ZGCEC5do2EfQTAGN9UifT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762271/RPReplay_Final1628115178_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gif compression turns it white, but the flare is still clearly visible in this video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNn8s7"&gt;As always with beta features, the functionality we’re seeing here could be different with the next release, or gone altogether. Still, it seems that Apple is at least experimenting with getting rid of the green blobs that can crop up in images from time to time, and it would be a welcome thing to see in the final version of iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook streamlines the settings page on mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeaYdozU55jXG8f3rO9Z0346mqc=/10x0:1398x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680466/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.36.00_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Facebook settings page compared to the new one on mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS, mobile web, and Facebook Lite. You might already have the redesign — I just checked the Facebook app on my iPhone 12 Mini and it loaded up. It was present on the mobile web for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
