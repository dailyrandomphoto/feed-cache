    <title>The first trailer for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings debuts Marvel’s latest martial arts hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1t6LFCEiZiF-xqovNlcosUC-xI=/471x0:1986x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149434/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_9.57.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkS9Nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; has gotten its first trailer, showing off the high-flying martial arts action and a new hero for the interconnected universe of Marvel films and shows: Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who’s known in the comics as Marvel’s preeminent master of martial arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU08zd"&gt;The trailer serves as a short introduction to Shang-Chi as he faces off against the mysterious Ten Rings organization and its true leader, the Mandarin. The Ten Rings have been a figure lurking in the background for the entirety of the MCU, first introduced in 2008’s&lt;em&gt; Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; (and notably spoofed by a copy-cat group in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; promises to reveal the actual group for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w0WnSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5D9LQf"&gt;The upcoming film also takes some inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/10/1/21495236/marvel-shang-chi-comic-review-gene-luen-yang"&gt;more recent &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; series of comics&lt;/a&gt;, which sees the martial arts master trying to enjoy life in San Francisco away from mystical (and family) drama only for his old life to come crashing back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt7nz0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first modern live-action martial arts-focused Marvel project; Netflix previously adapted &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; into a two-season TV series in 2017, but that project was developed by the now-defunct Marvel Television, instead of Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14980216/iron-fist-problems-marvel-netflix-writing-villains-optics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; also suffered from numerous issues&lt;/a&gt;, including lackluster fight scenes, a bloated runtime, and a frustratingly outdated white savior narrative — all things &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; (with its considerably bigger budget, tighter cinematic runtime, and considerably more diverse cast and creative team) looks to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G6mnF"&gt;The trailer comes hot on the heels of Liu teasing the first poster for the upcoming film on Twitter, which also showcases a look at Shang-Chi’s full superhero costume (which notably doesn’t appear too much in the trailer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJj1dS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whoever said that you could only RECEIVE presents on your birthday? Today, I’m giving you your VERY FIRST LOOK at the teaser poster for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shangchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ShangChi&lt;/a&gt; and the Legend of the Ten Rings!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming to theatres September 3rd (trailer drops in a few weeks). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WE’RE ALMOST THERE, PEOPLE!!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kzgkg8djeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kzgkg8djeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1384129985712033800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l707yT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;is also set to mark Marvel’s return to exclusively theatrical films. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will be released concurrently on Disney Plus Premier Access and in theaters, &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;will debut in theaters only on September 3rd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ramps up moderation around Derek Chauvin trial, will delete posts mocking George Floyd’s death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Minneapolis Area Continues To Grapple With Police Brutality As Chauvin Trial Verdict Looms" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQJmkR3Pm77NvOjEhpbbF8knXs0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149387/1313185888.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5CCRlj"&gt;Facebook says it’s taking extra moderation measures around the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer accused of murdering Minneapolis man George Floyd last year. As a verdict in the trial approaches, Facebook has designated Minneapolis a “high-risk location” where it will seek and remove calls to bring weapons to events. It will also remove content that “praises, celebrates, or mocks George Floyd’s death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2VVHB"&gt;Facebook content moderation VP Monika Bickert outlined &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/preparing-for-a-verdict-in-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin/"&gt;preparations for a verdict&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post this morning. “We want to strike the right balance between allowing people to speak about the trial and what the verdict means, while still doing our part to protect everyone’s safety,” Bickert writes. Users can “discuss, critique, and criticize the trial and the attorneys involved,” but Facebook will remove content that violates its policies, and it “may also limit the spread of content that our systems predict is likely to violate our Community Standards.” And it will “remove events organized in temporary, high-risk locations that contain calls to bring arms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aOyP0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can still “discuss, critique, and criticize” the trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqrnZw"&gt;The company will delete “severe” attacks on Chauvin, although Facebook considers the former officer a public figure for “voluntarily placing himself in the public eye” — as opposed to Floyd, who is granted a higher standard of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCDTmi"&gt;Much of Bickert’s post outlines steps Facebook is supposed to take with all content. But it indicates that Facebook could be particularly vigilant in, for instance, removing incendiary event pages around Minneapolis. Last year, the company was criticized for not removing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403004/facebook-kenosha-militia-groups-shooting-blm-protest"&gt;a self-proclaimed militia’s “call to arms”&lt;/a&gt; in Kenosha, Wisconsin, until a fatal shooting took place during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meAd4z"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337583/atlanta-shooting-attack-facebook-posts-removed-supporting-praising"&gt;made a similar announcement&lt;/a&gt; last month around the mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, when it banned any posts that celebrated the attack or the alleged killer. However, Chauvin’s trial is a more potentially volatile situation, especially as footage of police violence — like the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56768217"&gt;shooting of 13-year-old Adam Toledo&lt;/a&gt; — has spread on social media during it. Facebook says that “given the risk of violence following the announcement of the verdict, regardless of what it is, we remain in close contact with local, state and federal law enforcement” after the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord loosens NSFW server ban on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fo9Y470qpMa7BxBVrzCcx-O9Ot4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149324/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qTaBqj"&gt;Discord has &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation"&gt;loosened its ban&lt;/a&gt; on accessing NSFW servers from its iPhone and iPad apps. Now, only servers focused on “explicit pornographic content” will be fully blocked from being accessed through the apps. Other NSFW servers will still be blocked by default, but users will be able to opt in to viewing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgAnsC"&gt;The changes walk back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381728/discord-nsfw-servers-blocked-ios-age-gate-restrictions"&gt;a stricter ban on NSFW content&lt;/a&gt; that Discord put in place &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210413070907/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. On April 12th, Discord said it would require server owners to mark their community as NSFW if it was “organized around NSFW themes.” Under the original plan, any server marked NSFW would have been inaccessible on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0tIsO"&gt;Users were frustrated with the changes, though, since it limited their ability to communicate with others and moderate servers they were in charge of. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Discord for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRE4fR"&gt;Discord hasn’t said why the restrictions were added, but it clearly has to do with Apple. Apple has firm restrictions on nudity in the App Store, and Discord may have risked an outright ban if it didn’t block content to come into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mno4Gs"&gt;Apple does offer &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content"&gt;a partial loophole&lt;/a&gt;, though, which Discord is taking advantage of: “incidental mature ‘NSFW’ content” is allowed in iOS apps, so long as it’s hidden by default. Apple requires that users opt in via a website — not the app itself — and that’s exactly how Discord has set up its system to reenable access to NSFW content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8ibw3"&gt;The changes don’t solve the problem for Discord users entirely, but they could offer continued access for some concerned roleplay and art communities that were unsure if they would be able to reach their servers because of the ban.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 headset comes with a free accessory at Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0Fn5Pi4MuRfBptOSSEqzSi7Ol8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149308/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCrdsb"&gt;If you’re hunting for an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, Newegg has an appealing sale happening on bundles that will net you a free accessory. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4237997%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $350&lt;/a&gt;, you can get the 64GB headset (normally $300 by itself) with Logitech’s G333 VR wired earbuds and the Oculus Elite strap. Both accessories would usually add $100 to the total, but with this bundle, you’re saving $49, so it’s like you’re getting the ever-useful and comfortable Elite strap for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IDrpq7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8gLpC"&gt;Newegg has other bundles that might appeal to you more. It has one that includes the headset with the Logitech earbuds and the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up carrying case instead of the Elite strap. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238013%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This one costs a total of $359&lt;/a&gt;, so you’re paying just $10 for the case instead of $50. The other great bundle &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238012%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;option for $349&lt;/a&gt; includes the headset, earbuds, and Oculus’ fit pack with a pair of light blockers and two alternate-width facial interfaces made for “users with low nose bridges and wider or narrower cheekbones,” as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Faccessories%2Fquest-2-fit-pack%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ site says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

This gadget usually costs $50, and it might suit you perfectly if you need a bedside alarm with some smarts. Its display shows the time, weather conditions, and current alarms, and it doesn’t take up much space. It also has a USB-A port around its back that you can charge a device through. It can play music, but it won’t be a suitable stand-in for the Google Nest Audio, as its speaker isn’t nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjI1SN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273272"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgvNl6"&gt;One of Amazon’s deals of the day is a sizable discount on its Fire HD 8 tablet with 32GB of storage that comes bundled with the Blink Mini camera. It’s normally $125 if you pay full price for both products, but you can snag them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B08XV5X86G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 right now (and for the rest of Monday, April 19th) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738214635752240878#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is in on the deal, too, if you prefer to shop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="79IOtc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s xCloud beta arrives on iOS and PC this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWT2Iub2qs3ihOyDkYk0v0-rf2M=/0x0:1786x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149306/xcloudiphoneipad.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFhN71"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) will officially arrive on iOS and PC tomorrow, April 20th. The service will arrive on devices via browsers, allowing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play Xbox games on iPhones, iPads, and PCs. Microsoft is keeping this beta rather limited, though, and requiring players to be invited to participate in the testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl7H2c"&gt;The service will be accessible at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.com%2Fplay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F19%2F22391561%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;www.xbox.com/play&lt;/a&gt;, where Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who have been invited to the beta will be able to play Xbox games through Edge, Chrome, or Safari browsers. More than 100 games will be available, and testers will be able to use a compatible Bluetooth or USB-connected controller or simply use custom touch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Lc2QJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A limited beta will be available in 22 countries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3yIhV"&gt;“The limited beta is our time to test and learn; we’ll send out more invites on a continuous basis to players in all 22 supported countries, evaluate feedback, continue to improve the experience, and add support for more devices,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-cloud-gaming-windows-pc-and-apple-limited-beta/"&gt;says Catherine Gluckstein&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of xCloud. “Our plan is to iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months so more people have the opportunity to play Xbox in all-new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Np1o"&gt;It’s the first time Xbox Game Streaming has been available on iOS devices after the service launched exclusively on Android phones and tablets last year. Microsoft wasn’t able to offer xCloud on iPhones or iPads during the initial launch phase of the service back in September due to Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV739"&gt;Both Apple and Microsoft got into a public war of words over xCloud, and Apple initially insisted that Microsoft would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;submit individual games for review&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;offered a compromise&lt;/a&gt; to allow cloud gaming apps to run on iOS with individually reviewed games, but Microsoft branded it a “bad experience for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Roku’s new $30 remote has upgrades like a rechargeable battery and hands-free voice commands&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0cwfK6"&gt;Roku’s new Voice Remote Pro is the company’s first remote control to come with always-listening mics built in. These let you easily launch a streaming app or find the remote itself, should it get lost in the couch cushions, using just your voice. The new $29.99 remote, a standalone purchase that works with Roku streamers and Roku TVs, also has a headphone jack for private listening and includes buttons for controlling your TV’s power and volume. And to round it all out, Roku throws in two customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to remember any voice command and repeat it with a press. Perhaps best of all, you won’t need to hunt for AA batteries anymore: the Voice Remote Pro replaces them with a rechargeable battery that can last for up to two months on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdCTlX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10453604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgUOrh"&gt;It definitely looks the part of a Roku remote. Weight-wise, the Voice Remote Pro felt about the same in my hand as the remote that came with my TCL Roku TV. But instead of a removable back cover, there’s a Micro USB port at the bottom of this one. Yes, I very much wish it was a USB-C jack instead, but Roku chose the older plug. Either way, it’s largely hidden from view when you’re using the remote since it’s behind the purple Roku tag. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HaPcAUj7ZlWDFyzeWB01zt2rf_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448507/DSCF3627_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Voice Remote Pro has a rechargeable battery that uses a Micro USB connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fdVvS1"&gt;On the left side is a 3.5mm jack that will pass the audio from your Roku TV or Roku streaming device to whatever headphones you plug in. Private listening remains a huge convenience, though other platforms like the Chromecast with Google TV, Fire TV, and Apple TV support Bluetooth earbuds to achieve the same end result; if you need to keep a room quiet but still want to enjoy a show or movie, you can have your own private bubble of sound without disturbing others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1LRUp"&gt;There’s another new addition on the remote’s left side: Roku has included a sliding switch to enable or turn off the Voice Remote Pro’s always-listening mode. Some people aren’t comfortable with microphones constantly being on in their home and listening for a wake phrase. If you switch off hands-free mode, you can still press and hold the microphone button on the front of the remote to speak commands. On the right side are a volume rocker and mute button. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x2xABclZAR__aqRhVuByj7iNmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448504/DSCF3622_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a slider switch to enable or turn off the always-listening mics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqOBVN"&gt;All of the buttons on the face of the Voice Remote Pro are the same size as those on my TCL Roku remote, though this remote is a bit taller since it adds two programmable buttons above the four branded shortcut buttons. Roku’s marketing images show an Apple TV Plus button alongside Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. But the remote I received to review actually had Sling TV on there instead of Apple’s service. Roku tells me it’ll be changing this in future shipments, which I take as a sign of how recently its deal with Apple came together. The buttons aren’t remappable, so if you want the Apple one, it’s probably best to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH22OJ"&gt;Some people don’t mind these branded buttons since they’re easy to use and straightforward: others complain that there’s always some app or service in the foursome that they either don’t have or never use. Sometimes the buttons manage to outlive their advertised services: Roku has had Blockbuster, PlayStation Vue, and Rdio on its remotes before — all services that no longer exist. I can understand both arguments, but considering how much money Roku rakes in from those quick-access shortcuts, the sponsored buttons are here to stay. Thankfully, Roku has at least made a good decision by including two customizable buttons to go along with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB4EZ8"&gt;The buttons labeled “1” and “2” can save any voice command that Roku supports; just long-press either button after the voice command, and it’ll be set as that button’s function. This can be as simple as using them as two shortcuts for apps that don’t have their own button, like “open HBO Max” or “open Peacock.” But you can also use the shortcut buttons for searches (“show me free movies”), input selection (“switch to antenna TV”), or TV controls (“turn the volume up,” “turn on closed captioning”). I like the flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xp843ZLmWbghXya4K7OYdABcSpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448505/DSCF3623_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Apple TV Plus button will eventually replace Sling TV on the Voice Remote Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2aFOkg"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro’s built-in microphones did a fine job picking up my voice when on the coffee table several feet away from me; I didn’t have to shout or over-enunciate anything for my voice commands to register successfully. Roku says the “mid-field microphones” can work at distances up to 12 feet, but at that point, you’d probably need to raise your voice some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8uVFp"&gt;Don’t expect Roku’s voice platform to be a replacement for the Google Assistant or Alexa, though. Aside from opening channels or searching for content, it’s all still rudimentary stuff. You can ask it what the time is, but it can’t give you the weather. “Turn the volume up” worked perfectly on my TCL Roku TV, but “turn the brightness down” didn’t. Certain apps like Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max can &lt;a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694"&gt;start playing content directly after a voice request&lt;/a&gt;, but “watch&lt;em&gt; The Crown&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix” requires you to click in from the voice search result. (You can say “Hey Roku, OK” to select whatever’s currently highlighted, so you can technically still start watching using only your voice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="p55tAn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VbN9CN"&gt;“Hey Roku, find the remote” easily proved to be my favorite voice command. Assuming the remote is in a spot where it can hear you say that, it’ll emit a sound for 60 seconds or until you press a button to indicate it’s been found. The Roku Ultra has a button on the streaming box itself for this purpose, but this is even easier — assuming you’re okay with the always-on mics. You can also trigger the remote beeping with Roku’s smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xacziY"&gt;Amazon recently announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348578/amazon-ruins-fire-tv-remote-netflix-disney-hulu-buttons"&gt;adding sponsored shortcut buttons to the Fire TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, and that means Roku and Amazon are pretty much identical when it comes to clicker functionality. Both can control your TV’s power and volume, both have the dedicated sponsored buttons. Roku’s Voice Remote Pro pulls ahead with the customizable buttons that Amazon’s remote lacks, however. And Amazon still requires you to press and hold the mic button for Alexa commands; there’s no hands-free option. It’s a bit surprising that Roku beat Amazon to a remote that you can talk to from across the room, though the Fire TV Cube builds hands-free commands into the streaming device itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxvxMurv6zxnr22QOYTFGtxpaRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448508/DSCF3628_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get two customizable shortcut buttons that can open any app you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5LIEG"&gt;Roku’s Voice Remote Pro is being released just after Logitech confirmed that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377015/logitech-discontinues-harmony-universal-remotes"&gt;finished making Harmony remotes&lt;/a&gt;. And in part, these streaming remotes are why; thanks to HDMI-CEC, they can cover enough ground for a lot of people that universal remotes aren’t the essential living room gadgets they were 10 years ago. And TVs are increasingly getting “smarter” with built-in support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, so you can include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4XuWb"&gt;Purely from an ergonomic standpoint, my favorite streaming player remote remains Nvidia’s backlit remote for the Shield TV. Yes, it’s got a Netflix button — but that’s it for sponsored buttons. And Nvidia lets you fully customize what the settings button does. You can decide what a single tap, press and hold, or double press will do. These can be set to open different apps if you want, or you can pick from many other functions. There’s no headphone jack, and Nvidia is still using regular old AA batteries, so Roku still comes out ahead in some ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2ziUE"&gt;The Apple TV remote steers clear of streaming app buttons, but it’s too small, easily lost in the far reaches of the couch, and just not great to use. Google’s remote for the latest Chromecast is simple enough, but the furthest it goes with “customizable” buttons is letting you choose which YouTube app — YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Kids, YouTube Music, etc. — the YouTube button will open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyuSSk"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro is the best execution of a Roku remote so far, even if it can’t approach the scope of what a Harmony is capable of. The programmable buttons, private listening, and hands-free voice commands are enough to justify the $29.99 price and upgrade from a standard Roku remote. Not everyone will be comfortable with a remote that’s always listening to them, but with the money you’ll save on batteries, it basically pays for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctors are testing a prescription video game for COVID-19 ‘brain fog’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Akili CEO plays the company’s video game on an iPad. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gFIF4uS_sdl_QGdGOVsfGYCskUg=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148999/496533132.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Akili Interactive video game.  | Photo by Dina Rudick/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m71F2M"&gt;A research team is testing a prescription video game to see if it can help people who have lingering memory and attention problems after recovering from COVID-19. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html"&gt;Many people&lt;/a&gt; who survived the disease say that they’re often confused and have difficulty focusing, and research studies show that the symptoms can stick around for months after they recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXfVRb"&gt;Faith Gunning, a neuropsychologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, thinks the &lt;a href="https://www.endeavorrx.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EndeavorRX&lt;/em&gt; video game&lt;/a&gt; might be able to treat some of those symptoms. The game, made by Akili Interactive, made history last summer when it became the first video game to get the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;sign-off&lt;/a&gt; to be prescribed as a medical treatment. It’s cleared as a treatment for kids between the ages of eight and 12 with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZdaXf"&gt;But Gunning thinks it could help other groups of people. “I was already interested in the game,” she says. Then, she started to see the signs that people who had COVID-19 might be struggling with some of the same symptoms the game can target. She’s &lt;a href="https://jcto.weill.cornell.edu/open_clinical_trials/improving-cognitive-health-in-covid-19-survivors-through-digital-therapeutics"&gt;launching a study&lt;/a&gt; to test if it can help those patients. One group of people who had COVID-19 and have cognitive problems will play the game, and the study will check if their symptoms improve more than a group of COVID-19 survivors with similar symptoms who don’t play the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fItUxj"&gt;“We need more interventions in general, in cognitive and mental health, that we can get out into the community,” Gunning says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl2WOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Gunning about why the game, if it proves to be effective, could be one good strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjoEAL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMI1uI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of cognitive issues are you seeing in people who have had COVID-19? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPWikI"&gt;We did a study on patients following an infection with COVID-19. I’m going to give the caveat that these are individuals who required hospitalization and had rehab before they were discharged home. So these were individuals who had moderate to severe COVID-19 — so it’s not representative of the general population. What we found is that a very high percentage of individuals had disturbances that ranged from mild to severe in their cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEzpM4"&gt;We found a pattern that included things like disruption in attention and in the ability to do more than one thing at once. We found a high percentage had difficulty with working memory, which is the ability to hold information in your head while doing something else. All of these are skills that are important for everything we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WEwFt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were you interested in the Akili Interactive video game? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NguLgn"&gt;The game has always intrigued me. I’d already been working with the video game for a few years. It really does target an important function: the ability to do more than one thing at a time. It improves it, and we’ve seen the game improve it in people with ADHD, in older adults, and there’s some indication it helps in people with multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz2CLY"&gt;It targets these really important cognitive skills, and it’s really engaging. One of the issues that you often find with cognitive interventions is that, frankly, they’re boring. So people won’t do them. And if people won’t do them, they’re not going to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bspQe4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has your non-COVID-19 research on this video game found? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCfN49"&gt;We’re using it in older adults who have some cognitive issues and middle-aged and older adults who have depression and some other cognitive issues. And what we’ve found is that those people do show changes in their brains. We showed that there’s improvement in connectivity within brain networks that support attention and executive skills, and we have some preliminary data showing improvement in mood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8hUKB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think this could help COVID-19 survivors? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpAHig"&gt;We don’t think everybody who’s recovering from COVID-19 needs cognitive intervention. But there is enough data that suggests that a significant number of people who have suffered from COVID-19 will have some cognitive issues. These disturbances aren’t just specific to people recovering from COVID-19; we see them across a lot of conditions that impact the brain. I think if we can improve those functions, regardless of what’s causing them, we can improve their daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKIBnR"&gt;We’re looking for two main outcomes: cognitive skills and daily functioning. Because really, that’s the goal. We’re talking about COVID-19 disrupting people’s ability to function in their everyday lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9r0yE"&gt;A video game is also scalable. It’s something that can be given to lots of people. We need things we can get out into the community. Even if it’s a small subset of people who had COVID-19, the sheer number of people who had COVID-19 means we need interventions that are effective and can be disseminated widely. We’re not going to have the workforce to have one-on-one cognitive intervention for all the people who were sick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo will provide cars for Didi’s autonomous vehicle division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-NZhHEq4bZoXy6Rfk3VFbGKEcY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148794/Volvo_XC90_DiDi_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbDuUc"&gt;Volvo will provide vehicles for Didi Chuxing’s self-driving taxi fleet, according to a new deal between the two companies. The Swedish automaker, which is owned by China’s largest private automaker Geely, will supply XC90 SUVs to Didi Autonomous Driving, the self-driving technology division of China’s vehicle-for-hire company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtEo0a"&gt;Didi said it would use Volvo’s SUVs when it eventually launches a commercial robotaxi operation at a later date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20840954/china-didi-chuxing-self-driving-car-robot-taxi-launch-experiment-shanghai"&gt;The company has been testing its autonomous technology in Shanghai since 2019&lt;/a&gt; as part of a pilot approved by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRX9P"&gt;It’s an interesting twist, considering Volvo used to be a partner in another global ride-hailing firm’s autonomous ambitions. Volvo had an agreement with Uber to deploy a fleet of self-driving taxis by 2019, but that plan was scrapped after an Uber test vehicle (an XC90 SUV) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174636/uber-self-driving-crash-fatal-arizona-update"&gt;struck and killed a pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; in Tempe, Arizona, in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RqOiCb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an interesting twist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXzDlA"&gt;Still, the Swedish automaker maintained its partnership with Uber’s autonomous division, announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662626/uber-volvo-self-driving-car-safety-autonomous-factory-level"&gt;a jointly developed self-driving version of the Volvo XC90 SUV&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Last year, under pressure from investors, Uber sold its autonomous division to self-driving startup Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu6DLp"&gt;Notably, Volvo says the vehicles it will be supplying to Didi will be “equipped with necessary backup systems for functions such as steering and braking.” Those functions, such as automatic emergency braking, were disabled by Uber in the self-driving SUV that killed the pedestrian in Arizona in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrZhZX"&gt;Didi isn’t the only company to use Volvo’s Swedish engineered vehicles as part of a robotaxi fleet. Waymo, the self-driving division of Alphabet, announced last year that it would be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303324/volvo-waymo-l4-deal-electric-self-driving-robot-taxi"&gt;“exclusive global L4 partner”&lt;/a&gt; for Volvo and its sub-brands Polestar and Lynk &amp;amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUWRdE"&gt;Volvo also has plans to sell customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;partially automated vehicles equipped with LIDAR sensors made by US startup Luminar&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker said its vehicles will be able to drive themselves on highways hands-free, with no human intervention, and will start rolling off the production line in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYg13v"&gt;Didi started its ride-hailing business in China in 2012. It nabbed $1 billion from &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11669178/apple-invests-1-billion-in-chinese-transportation-service-didi-chuxing"&gt;Apple in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the same time it was locked in an intense competition with Uber for China’s rapidly growing ride-hail market and had started poaching engineers from Silicon Valley to come work for its nascent self-driving program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74lcXr"&gt;Eventually, the battle grew too costly for Uber, which was reportedly burning through $1 billion a year to compete with the Chinese firm. In August 2016, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12339950/uber-didi-chuxing-china-merge"&gt;sell Uber’s Chinese business to Didi&lt;/a&gt; for a 17.7 percent stake in Didi and a seat on the company’s board. In exchange, Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHSdt"&gt;Didi has also invested in many of Uber’s rivals, including Lyft, India’s Ola, Singapore-headquartered Grab, Estonia’s Taxify, Careem in the Middle East (which was later acquired by Uber), and Brazil’s 99. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16748178/didi-chuxing-mexico-expand-ride-hail-uber"&gt;expanded into Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, intensifying its global rivalry with Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Qv1Mn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is making it easier to export text posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMN9DlW580ilPCiEPYhQ6dVQIe8=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148632/DataPortabilityGIF.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbAIdj"&gt;Facebook is rolling out a new feature today, allowing users across the globe to have the option to archive their posts and notes created on the social media site and transfer a copy of that data onto Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger. It’s expanding on a similar tool the company released last year that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241093/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data"&gt;transfer photos from its platform onto Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the tool allows users leaving Facebook to preserve a version of the content associated with their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6FvjV"&gt;Users can access the tool by opening Facebook settings and clicking on “Your Facebook Information,” then selecting “Transfer a Copy of Your Information.” There, you can select which destination to transfer the data to (Google Docs, WordPress, or Blogger), log in to the account you select, and confirm the transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaLIwh"&gt;The new feature is part of the Data Transfer Project, a cross-company data-sharing initiative that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"&gt;launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of allowing you to move data across various online services and platforms seamlessly. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are also involved in the project, offering similar data-export tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vi9gfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook hopes to advance the conversation with policymakers, developers, and experts regarding data portability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omsDXY"&gt;The feature is convenient for users who want to share specific posts or notes they created through Facebook. Still, it is important to note that data ported will not archive comments from other users since those comments are seen as belonging to a separate account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0xhwh"&gt;The new data export tools help bring Facebook in line with two recent tech regulation laws — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039228/california-ccpa-facebook-microsoft-gdpr-privacy-law-consumer-data-regulation"&gt;California’s Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; and the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Both laws require that companies provide personal information in a readily usable format upon request, although the specifics of the format and interoperability measures are left unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dZYqV"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter nailed a successful debut test flight on Mars, engineers confirmed early Monday morning. The tiny spacecraft lifted itself 10 feet off the Martian surface for 39 seconds, marking the first powered flight on another world. The historic demonstration opens up tantalizing possibilities for a new mode of planetary travel that could send future rotorcraft far beyond the reach of traditional rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Opmu"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity helicopter lifted its tissue box-sized body at 12:34PM Mars time (3:34AM ET, Earth time), spinning its twin rotor blades to achieve its first flight in the ultrathin atmosphere of Mars. Those blades spun faster than 2,500 rpm — much faster than the roughly 500 rpm helicopters need to fly on Earth. The craft hovered for about 30 seconds above the surface before descending for touchdown, concluding a fully autonomous 39.1-second flight test, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PxuYz"&gt;The rotorcraft arrived on the Red Planet, 173 million miles from Earth, on February 18th, clinging to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover. It was deployed from Perseverance over a month later, on April 4th, starting a 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests. Monday’s successful flight sets the stage for more ambitious attempts in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIwoXS"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory broke out in cheers upon confirmation that Ingenuity’s flight attempt appeared flawless. “Confirmed, that Ingenuity has performed its first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet,” Ingenuity chief pilot Håvard Grip declared, prompting applause inside JPL Mission Control. “We can now say that humans beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,” Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung told NASA engineers in the room after confirmation of the helicopter’s successful flight test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A red-letter day on the Red Planet! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qow8JwhYEo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Qow8JwhYEo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384099533026566148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk1I97"&gt;“This gives us amazing hope for all of humanity. I couldn’t be more proud,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate NASA administrator for science, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1384102594319032329"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successful confirmation, Zurbuchen said NASA named Ingenuity’s flight zone Wright Brothers Field, as a nod to the Wright brothers’ revolutionary flight in 1903 and “in recognition of the ingenuity and innovation that continue to propel exploration.” The helicopter carries on its body a postage stamp-sized piece of the Wright brothers’ iconic plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQpgv6"&gt;A black-and-white image from Ingenuity’s down-facing navigation camera was the first visual confirmation of the copter’s flight, showing the experimental craft’s shadow from roughly 10 feet above the surface. Minutes after flight confirmation, a sequence of images taken by Perseverance, watching from about 211 feet away, arrived at Mission Control and put Ingenuity’s flight in motion for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingenuity soared 10 feet off the ground over Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyg7DV"&gt;The flight was delayed a few times from April 11th, with one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;delay last week&lt;/a&gt; requiring engineers to reupload Ingenuity’s entire flight software after running into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; during preflight tests. The helicopter has a running track-shaped flight zone at Mars’ Jezero Crater, the site of a dried-out lakebed that Perseverance will scour for signs of past microbial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOh6Mg"&gt;Ingenuity’s main mission is to demonstrate flight, with no objectives to explore Mars or carry out science experiments. Those jobs are reserved for Perseverance, whose primary life-hunting mission involves caching Martian soil samples that a future rover will send back to Earth as early as 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2dRYq"&gt;Engineers will analyze loads of data from Ingenuity’s first flight to set the parameters for its next four flights in the coming weeks, with the second one scheduled for April 22nd, NASA said. For those tests, Ingenuity will soar higher and travel across its flight zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzyrLT"&gt;“Like the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, we know that our time to make a difference at Jezero Crater, Mars is not yet over,” Aung told engineers in Mission Control. “This is just the first great flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
