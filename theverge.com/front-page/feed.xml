    <title>Amazon makes a deal with Stellantis to buy electric Dodge ProMaster delivery vans in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30IN0jikUHxewa2U91mOaQmcXJs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349926/RM022_003PM5c7g3f2a7m92sb3l707vf26o5j.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KpuEvp"&gt;Amazon announced that it will buy an undisclosed number of electric delivery vans from Stellantis in 2023. The automaker has said that it will roll out an all-electric version of its Dodge ProMaster commercial van that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0MfTO"&gt;Stellantis, which is the company that formed last year from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the French PSA Group, has not officially revealed the electric vans. But Amazon says it will be the first commercial customer when they eventually enter production, with the two companies working together to put “thousands” of electric vans on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sTaxX"&gt;Amazon has been working with Rivian, the buzzy electric vehicle company that went public last year in one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;, on a fleet of electric delivery vehicles. Amazon, which owns about 20 percent of the company, has said it plans on ordering 100,000 vans from Rivian, in what is seen as one of the largest EV purchases in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GwjL7r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Thousands” of electric delivery vans coming to Amazon’s fleet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aAO4MC"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334012/waymo-fca-ram-delivery-self-driving-van"&gt;Stellantis is also working with Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, the self-driving unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, on a fleet of autonomous Dodge ProMaster vans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah4PYQ"&gt;In addition to the deal for the Dodge EVs, Amazon and Stellantis also announced that they would be working together to develop in-car software for Stellantis’ lineup of cars, trucks, and vans. The deal will allow Amazon to integrate its software into “millions” of vehicles, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA6Dsd"&gt;The two companies will collaborate on software for the “digital cockpit” infotainment systems of Stellantis vehicles that will launch in 2024. Stellantis said it will use Amazon’s Alexa technology for voice-controlled features, “navigation, vehicle maintenance, ecommerce marketplaces, and payment services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6eitQ"&gt;“We’re excited to collaborate with Stellantis to transform the automotive industry and re-invent the in-vehicle experience,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHfNi"&gt;While this isn’t the same as Volvo completely turning over its vehicle operating system to Google’s Android, it does give Amazon a stronger toehold in the auto industry and could help Stellantis compete with other software-leading car companies like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHk8yU"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Amazon and Stellantis have collaborated. The two companies announced early last year that the 2022 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer would be the first vehicles to feature in-car Amazon FireTV. Amazon’s software is accessible from both the main display and rear seat screens, but privacy filters prevent the driver from watching shows while the vehicle is in motion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD has five new sub-$250 Nokia phones coming to the US soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXioUsd6x8fR5-uUDFXezX04piM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349795/HMD_New2022_Packshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Nokia 2760 Flip, C100, G400, C200, G100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bvnagr"&gt;HMD, the company behind modern Nokia-branded phones, has announced five new “US exclusive” phones coming in the first half of this year. None of these are flagships: there’s only one 5G device, and all five are set to retail for under $250. HMD has also revived a classic Nokia design as a modern feature phone — the Nokia 2760 — a flip phone that inherits its name from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2760"&gt;original 2007 handset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytpmPp"&gt;The company isn’t fully detailing the specs of the five phones today and says it plans to release this information closer to each handset’s launch. Instead, it’s emphasizing that the phones will be available across a wider range of US wireless providers, which now include Dish Wireless and Consumer Cellular in addition to T-Mobile and TracFone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hY2SVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Nokia 2760 was released in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czU073"&gt;In descending order of price, there’s the $239 G400, which is due for release in Q2. It’s a 5G phone with a triple rear camera array consisting of a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro. Interestingly, its 6.6-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is relatively uncommon at this price point. It has a 5,000mAh battery and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsgOp5"&gt;Then there’s the $149 G100, a 4G phone with a 6.5-inch display, 5,000mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that’s also due for release in Q2. Both the G100 and G400 are part of HMD’s midrange G-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnGIm"&gt;HMD’s also bringing two phones to the accessible, value-focused Nokia C-series range. There’s the $99 C100 (due in Q1) and $119 C200 (releasing in Q2). The C100 has a relatively compact 5.45-inch display, a relatively low-resolution 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 3,000mAh battery. The C200 is slightly larger with a 6.1-inch display and has a bigger 4,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbvOIW"&gt;Finally, there’s the $79 Nokia 2760 Flip, a clamshell feature phone releasing in Q1. It’s running KaiOS, which offers a limited amount of smartphone-style services like Google Maps, and its focus is on durability and reliability with a target customer age of mainly 55 and above. There’s also an emergency button on its side that can be configured to call a contact and share your location, and a small external screen for notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ verdict won’t change Silicon Valley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Holmes Theranos Court Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEgAGzMRgp24BzmHsRTKwrQnqo8=/0x0:4872x3248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349728/1181871591.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The market’s only gotten weirder since Theranos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KLa6QP"&gt;There is no doubt in my mind that former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes will appeal the four charges she was convicted of: conspiracy to defraud investors and wire fraud. She still has the Silicon Valley mindset, after all: reality can be bent to your will. But what have &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; learned from the Theranos trial? Almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6vjjd"&gt;Holmes was found guilty on four of 11 counts after about 50 hours of deliberation. Those counts could be grouped, roughly, into defrauding patients and defrauding investors. The jury found her not guilty of defrauding patients or conspiracy to defraud patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="idZ6jx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The easiest part of this case to prove was about money, and that was where the prosecution spent the bulk of its time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jRcXmy"&gt;This is the result of decisions made by prosecutors who want to &lt;em&gt;win.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-elizabeth-holmes-trial-u-s-gave-patients-a-small-stage-11641329202"&gt;Patients testified for far less time than investors&lt;/a&gt; and spent a little more than an hour total on the stand. Prosecutors also didn’t clearly tie the patients’ Theranos tests to Holmes. In a way, this made sense: there were more intermediaries between Holmes and the individual patients. Besides the patients’ individual doctors, there were also the personnel in the clinical lab, the lab directors, and so on. For the charges to stick, jurors had to believe Holmes had &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to defraud patients, not merely give them bad results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHDzs1"&gt;When it came to the investors, prosecutors had Holmes dead to rights. Unlike with the patients, she was in the room. There were emails and recordings. Holmes’ ties were clearer, and what she knew was clearer, too. The easiest part of this case to prove was about money, and that was where the prosecution spent the bulk of its time. Did Holmes lie to investors? The jury thought so on three counts, which represented a total of about $142 million from PFM Healthcare Master Fund, the DeVos family’s Lakeshore Capital Management, and Daniel Mosley’s Mosley Family Holdings. On three more investor counts, there was no verdict; a mistrial has been declared on those counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQSJ05"&gt;It has been curious to see &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/technology/elizabeth-holmes-verdict.html"&gt;Silicon Valley’s reaction to the verdict&lt;/a&gt;: claiming &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/silicon-valley-s-hypocrisy-over-elizabeth-holmes"&gt;Holmes wasn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; part of Silicon Valley at all,&lt;/a&gt; trial in San Jose notwithstanding. Theranos investors included Silicon Valley celebrities: Larry Ellison’s Tako Ventures, Tim Draper’s Draper Jurvetson Fischer, and Don Lucas, known for his early Oracle investment. ATA Ventures, a now-defunct fund that invested primarily in health software, and Crosslink Capital’s Beta Bayview were also among the investors. Two founders of Silicon Valley investment firms also got in: Dixon Doll of DCM and Reid Dennis of IVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqGviD"&gt;There are the cultural ties, too. Holmes appeared at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTHtSy5le4"&gt;TechCrunch Disrupt in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. While Andreessen Horowitz didn’t invest, Marc Andreessen was a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gaberivera/status/693555732000604163"&gt;vocal cheerleader&lt;/a&gt; for Holmes — even &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive"&gt;calling her the next Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;. From the extra-voting shares to the black turtlenecks, from Holmes’ claims of sleeping at work to employees sleeping in their cars, the connection was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wPK8lf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VCs told The Wall Street Journal early this year that they were spending&lt;em&gt; less &lt;/em&gt;time on due diligence before investing &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlhnX8"&gt;But the delusional optimism that Holmes’ rise represented isn’t limited to Silicon Valley — at least, not anymore. It’s spread widely. Elon Musk’s success with Tesla kicked off a frenzy of electric vehicle SPACs, followed by a wave of fraud allegations. There’s Nikola, whose founder Trevor Milton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;was indicted for fraud&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors is being frisked by the SEC for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;possibly misleading investors about preorders&lt;/a&gt;. Canoo, another recent SPAC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;is also under investigation&lt;/a&gt;. So’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820435/lucid-motors-sec-investigation-spac-merger-churchill"&gt;Lucid Motors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk9lSr"&gt;There’s been a lot of talk about “fake it til you make it” as a founder credo, particularly in &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley"&gt;Alex Gibney’s Theranos doc, &lt;em&gt;The Inventor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You’d think this would make investors more likely to do their own technical due diligence, rather than relying on someone else’s. But some venture capitalists &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-booming-startup-market-prompts-an-investment-rush-for-ever-younger-companies-11641119403"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;early this year that they were spending &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; time on due diligence before investing — the hot market makes it hard to compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IH639"&gt;That rush isn’t just venture capital. Hedge funds and others have also moved into startups. One of the major sources of Thearnos’ funding was family offices for notables such as Rupert Murdoch, Betsy DeVos, and the Walton family, of Walmart fame. In 2018, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; speculated that &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/12/15/family-offices-become-financial-titans"&gt;family offices controlled $3 trillion to $4 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in capital. Likely, that number is higher now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Chj5nJ"&gt;Those investors received information packets that included Holmes’ press appearances. Investors frequently testified about &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;a 2013 article in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; opinion section&lt;/a&gt; that touted Theranos’ tech as “faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods.” That wasn’t true. Investors also pointed to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;a 2014 &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that said Theranos “does not buy any analyzers from third parties,” which wasn’t true, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BlqLe1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Investors aren’t exactly motivated to expose wrongdoing, as it can tank their investment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCFt38"&gt;After Theranos, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/18/technology/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial.html"&gt;tenor of Silicon Valley coverage changed&lt;/a&gt;, becoming more skeptical. Tech companies have at times objected to the increased scrutiny — well, everyone is entitled to their opinions — but in some ways, it makes sense. Investors aren’t exactly motivated to expose wrongdoing, as it can tank their investment. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;it’s embarrassing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbJR2g"&gt;Nothing about the result of this trial is going to prevent the next Theranos from bilking investors because no one is punished when investors don’t engage in due diligence. The onus is instead on the legal system — and thus, the average taxpayer — to get a guilty verdict in court. And because that’s easier to prove than the behavior that’s more likely to harm average people, that’s where prosecutors will focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VLukA"&gt;Because if we’ve learned anything, it’s this: The startup founders exaggerating what their companies are capable of are the one who takes the fall, but only if they get caught red-handed, like Holmes did. Thankfully for investors — and the startup hype cycle — you don’t go to jail for being a sucker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa and Cisco’s Webex are heading to deep space on NASA’s upcoming Moon mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpqfLIzs25fGE5jIsgoNxxHBVi0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349632/Callisto_on_board_Orion.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Callisto system inside the Orion crew capsule for Artemis I&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EnFKNx"&gt;When NASA debuts its new massive deep-space rocket for the first time in the coming months, a familiar voice assistant and video teleconferencing tool will be going along for the ride. A version of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant and Cisco’s Webex videoconferencing platform&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be included on the flight to space, part of a technology demonstration to see if these tools might benefit future astronauts flying to distant destinations like the Moon and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oiq0Zn"&gt;The upcoming flight is known as Artemis I, and it’s the first test mission in a series of flights planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772427/nasa-artemis-program-moon-lunar-landing-2025-delay"&gt;NASA’s Artemis program&lt;/a&gt; — an initiative to send the first woman and the first person of color to the surface of the Moon. &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/12/17/artemis-i-integrated-testing-update/"&gt;Tentatively set for March&lt;/a&gt;, Artemis I will mark the inaugural flight of NASA’s next-generation rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, a gargantuan rocket that Boeing has been developing for the last decade. The SLS is designed to launch people and cargo into deep space, with passengers riding on top of the vehicle in a new crew capsule called Orion, developed by Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gTo3Vs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a future in which astronauts could turn to an onboard artificial intelligence for information”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bh33kk"&gt;For Artemis I, SLS will launch an Orion crew capsule around the Moon on a weeks-long flight — the first time the two vehicles will fly to space together. This is a critical test launch, so no people will be flying inside Orion, save for a mannequin. However, the fake passenger will have some machine companions. Lockheed Martin teamed up with Amazon and Cisco to mount a “human-machine interface” in the spot where Orion’s control panel will be in the future. Called Callisto after the companion of Artemis in Greek mythology, the box will have a voice-activated Alexa speaker, with its iconic blue ring light, and an iPad that runs Webex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oEns6"&gt;At some point during the Artemis I mission, people on the ground will test out the box, as if astronauts are interacting with the speaker and the screen on board Orion. Ultimately, Lockheed Martin, Amazon, and Cisco want to see if such an interface would be beneficial for future deep space travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXETTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10961662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3TCJe7"&gt;“We... envision a future in which astronauts could turn to an onboard artificial intelligence for information and for assistance and ultimately for companionship,” Aaron Rubenson, vice president of Alexa Everywhere at Amazon, said during a press briefing. “You could easily imagine astronauts turning to this onboard AI to talk about the status of a subsystem or maybe controlling the lights in the cabin or asking for a particular camera view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyg7LF"&gt;To see if these tools work, Lockheed Martin will employ “virtual crew members” on the ground. While Orion is in space, a person in NASA’s mission control center in Houston will give a command to Alexa. That person’s voice will play out over a speaker inside Orion in order to activate Alexa. The virtual crew members will ask for certain types of information, such as the speed Orion is moving through space or how long until the capsule performs its next thruster burn. Alexa is designed to pull real-time data from Orion in order to answer those questions through its speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HJB2Sv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;virtual crew members will ask for certain types of information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wz4KYW"&gt;The Orion spacecraft is equipped with Wi-Fi, but since the vehicle will be hurtling through space away from Earth during the demonstration, internet connectivity is going to be limited. As a result, Alexa won’t need to access the internet during the flight to answer some of the immediate questions from the virtual crew members. Instead, Amazon designed this Alex with a system known as “local voice control,” allowing it to respond to a wide variety of pre-determined commands. “There are hundreds of parameters, thousands of utterances, where we’ll be able to get that real-time access,” Rob Chambers, director of commercial civil space strategy at Lockheed Martin, said during the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB0fVA"&gt;Virtual crew members will also ask Alexa to change the lighting inside Orion. “It is the iconic use case of Alexa, at least around my house,” said Chambers. Lockheed Martin has installed a separate LED lighting system inside the capsule behind the panel display, which Alexa should be able to control. Lockheed Martin has also mounted a few microphones and cameras throughout Orion’s cockpit, as well as a virtual reality camera, to record the demonstration and make sure the box works during the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csnHLH5MFB87M_5N0URkFsQDJm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145635/Callisto_on_bench_12_01_21_041.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Callisto box undergoing tests on the ground ahead of flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0iEIo"&gt;The last test will see if the Webex platform works. Virtual crew members on the ground will appear on the iPad screen inside Orion and have a video conference in 720P with Alexa during the flight. Of course, poor internet connectivity will likely be a problem with this one, too. “There will be a lot of back loss compensation technology because your network connectivity is going to be not as reliable as what you have,” Jeetu Patel, executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration at Cisco, said during the briefing. “And so we have to make sure that that’s factored in.” Cisco envisions this tool could be used by astronauts to videoconference with members of mission control or perhaps loved ones on the ground while astronauts are traveling through space.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbjKQe"&gt;However, Callisto is first and foremost a technology demonstration, and there are currently no plans to fly the box on future missions with Orion. The next flight after Artemis I is Artemis II, which will actually have astronauts on board Orion flying around the Moon. If Callisto does turn out to be a success, it’s possible a future version of the system will make it onto upcoming Artemis missions but in a very different form. “We’re discussing with NASA the other applications of this,” Chambers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNlPB3"&gt;The partners already have grand visions for what future Callisto systems could do, from controlling timers, video displays, cameras inside a spacecraft cockpit, or ambient temperatures. “We see the value now,” said Chambers. “We can start working with members of the space industry to figure out what are the most valuable things that should buy their way onto this capability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus says this is world’s first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E gaming router</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kd7pRY7BqTu_mbJQZCcfYEp_gI=/1x0:2500x1666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349446/GT_AXE16000_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Rapture GT-AXE16000.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2UKRj"&gt;Asus’ latest router is the ROG Rapture GT-AXE16000, and it says it’s the “world’s first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E gaming router.” That doesn’t quite make it the world’s first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E router overall (Netgear announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716979/netgear-orbi-quad-band-wi-fi-6e-mesh-router-release-date-specs-price"&gt;quad-band Orbi system last October&lt;/a&gt; which you can already buy), but this is the first such system to specifically target gamers, and as a standalone router its starting price is cheaper than comparable mesh systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXTFn5"&gt;Quad-band routers, as their name suggests, broadcast a total of four wireless bands for connectivity. Asus’ latest router has a 2.4GHz band, two 5GHz bands, and a fancy new 6GHz band. The three highest frequency bands each offer a theoretical maximum speed of 4,804Mbps, which drops to 1,148Mbps for the 2.4GHz band for up to 16Gbps of aggregate throughput (though, as always, real-world speeds will be significantly slower). You have the choice of either using the legacy 5GHz or new 6GHz bands as a backhaul if you want to set up a whole-home mesh network with another compatible Asus AiMesh router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZDumJG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mB4ZTRc7iUc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QTQv2Z"&gt;Of course, you also have the option of going wired, and if you do so you have the choice of two speedy 10Gbps LAN ports or four 1Gbps LAN ports. Its WAN port is rated at 2.5Gbps, and there are also a couple of USB ports for good measure. Did I mention it also looks like a creepy spider robot? Because of course it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y55U8g"&gt;Given how rare quad-band 6E routers still are, the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AXE16000 is perhaps unsurprisingly on the expensive side, and is set to cost $649 when it goes on sale later this quarter. But compared to Netgear’s quad-band Orbi system, which costs the better part of $1,500 for a three-pack of the mesh routers, Asus’ router looks almost affordable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo launches ‘color-changing’ V23 Pro with dual-camera notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YJxQIx9CTDImK8kNsOBLzSMtVw=/0x0:2304x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349280/V23_Series_Lifestyle_CGI___10.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkhF8b"&gt;Vivo has announced the V23 and V23 Pro, the latest phones in the company’s mainstream V series that sells a ton in India and other Asian countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQbem"&gt;The most unusual feature is the Sunshine Gold model’s ‘color-changing’ exterior that apparently shifts colors completely when exposed to sunlight. Vivo says the material took two years to research and develop; if you leave it in the sun for about thirty seconds, the phone will turn to blue-green before gradually returning back to the original gold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUSS3HXrMnCwBE394n4QxqjPdkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146721/V23_5G_Gold.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Plot twist: these phones are both gold.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CN50eX"&gt;The other standout feature is the display’s notch that houses two selfie cameras, a 50-megapixel main unit and an 8-megapixel ultrawide on both phones. The selfie camera system also supports eye-based autofocus. The V23 Pro has a 108-megapixel main camera on the back while the V23’s is 64 megapixels; both are joined by 8-megapixel ultrawide and 2-megapixel macro sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ja5bB6"&gt;The V23 Pro’s screen is a 6.56-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel with curved edges. The V23, however, has a flat 6.44-inch 90Hz 1080p panel, and the sides of the phone itself are also flat, similar to an iPhone 12 or 13. The other main difference between the two phones is the processor — the V23 has a MediaTek Dimensity 920, while the V23 Pro has a Dimensity 1200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pb2sS"&gt;In India, the V23 will sell for Rs. 29,990 (~$400) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or Rs. 34,990 (~$470) for 12GB/256GB. The V23 Pro costs Rs. 38,990 (~$520) for 8GB/128GB and Rs. 43,990 (~$590) for 12GB/256GB. The phones are also launching in countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, and will come to other markets in APAC, the Middle East, and Europe “over the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrysler previews its all-electric future with Airflow concept SUV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pROCSyHRbFdkcFi0iQ5yvDNrM_w=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70349090/CN021_010CH.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The iconic American brand will only sell electric vehicles by 2028&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cYjKAw"&gt;Chrysler, the iconic American brand owned by Stellantis, will only sell electric vehicles by 2028, the company announced at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZgGvV"&gt;To emphasize this seismic shift, the company revealed its latest concept, the Airflow crossover SUV with a similar profile to the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E. The vehicle unveiled at CES is meant to be just a concept, but it looks very close to production-ready. Chrysler says its first EV will start production in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AlsWsk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chrysler says it will begin producing its first EVs starting in 2025&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FBFC3T"&gt;Stellantis, the multi-national conglomeration that formed last year when Fiat Chrysler merged with the French PSA Group, intends for Chrysler to serve as the tip of the spear for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;its electrification strategy&lt;/a&gt;. The company, which is the fourth-largest automaker in the world, announced a comprehensive plan last year to electrify the lineups at most of its brands, including EV versions of the Dodge Ram 1500 and an electric muscle car, as well as multiple Jeep models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htNZX2"&gt;The Airflow, which alludes to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Airflow"&gt;a historic Chrysler nameplate&lt;/a&gt;, is meant to serve as a preview of what’s to come. Despite its backward-looking branding, the concept car is an indication of the “future direction” for the nearly 100-year-old car company, said Chrysler CEO Christine Feuell in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjFFcf6XtQtu01Ay-byIJ3tb_QU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140004/CN021_003CH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Stellantis&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbkSokQE-_pV3iVkStsp7wWJf9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140008/CN021_025CH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Stellantis&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dJ2SR8"&gt;The concept Airflow comes with all-wheel drive thanks to two 150kW motors, one in each axle. However, the drivetrain can be adjusted to accommodate more powerful motors in the future, Chrysler says. The company didn’t provide details on the battery’s size or energy capacity, but it did estimate a range of 350-400 miles per charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtveXj"&gt;The Airflow will come equipped with Stellantis’ “STLA AutoDrive” advanced driver assist system (ADAS), which enables Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities and over-the-air software updates. (The company recently held an event to tout its new software products, including an operating system called “STLA Brain.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2eJfSX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities and over-the-air software updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDv5GB"&gt;Level 3, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, refers to highly automated driving where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request. Level 4 automation means that the car is capable of handling most driving situations itself, whereas Level 5 is largely theoretical and covers complete automation in any condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2iLz7"&gt;It’s a risky move for Chrysler to brand its driver assist system as Level 3, given the troubles other automakers have had trying to include similar systems in their production vehicles. Audi, for example, said its A8 sedan would come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15952510/audi-a8-level-3-autonomous-driving-self-parking"&gt;a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot&lt;/a&gt; that, when active, would relieve human drivers of the need to pay attention during stop-and-go traffic. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/shift/why-level-3-automated-technology-has-failed-take-hold"&gt;But the feature was contingent on approval from local authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Jam Pilot remains dormant in most markets around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjgU4f"&gt;The Airflow announces itself as an EV right away with the illuminated Chrysler Wing logo on the front grille and full-width light bars on the front and rear of the vehicle — both common features in most modern EVs. Much like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the Airflow will have a long wheelbase and large 22-inch tires for a more low-slung riding style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJ5EKu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10957768"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SCKWGI"&gt;Inside, the vehicle is chock-a-block with screens: four in the front and two for rear passengers. The large central infotainment screen is flanked by smaller screens for the driver and passenger. The instrument cluster screen is set back a ways from the steering wheel, closer to the windshield than the dashboard, making it seem almost like a heads-up display. An additional screen sits below the main infotainment screen for HVAC controls and seating adjustments, among other features. And there are two screens on the seatbacks for rear passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzwcsu"&gt;Chrysler says the user interface will be defined by “personalization,” allowing drivers to connect to their “digital lives” through the screen of their cars. It’s unclear what exactly that means, but we can assume the Airflow will come with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ogMLk8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it finally churning out its own EVs 2025, Chrysler will find the market awash with electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMtTLO"&gt;When it’s finally churning out its own EVs in 2025, Chrysler will find the market awash with electric vehicles, as most of the automaker’s competitors have moved much more rapidly to electrify their lineups. All of Stellantis’ brands have been slow to embrace EV technology compared to its major competitors. Dodge is planning to release an all-electric muscle car in 2024, while Jeep says there will be electric versions of the Wrangler, Cherokee, and Wagoneer, in addition to other models, by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOAi96"&gt;We’ve gotten hints of electrification from Chrysler in the past, with little in the way of real-world results. Before it merged with PSA Group, Fiat Chrysler said it would team up with Foxconn to build EVs for Chinese consumers. The Italian-American automaker has also done some due diligence on a number of struggling EV startups in the US in an attempt to accelerate its electric ambitions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981965/fiat-chrysler-faraday-future-seres-ev-startups-tech"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JRjyX"&gt;Now that its gone public with its plans for a full battery-electric lineup, Chrysler will face new headwinds around supply chain woes and the lack of a robust charging infrastructure. Its rivals have already outlined their plan of attack, and Chrysler will need to develop its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPee5x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kS6kS7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy Wemo’s new HomeKit video doorbell right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zMBxWbucHBklViMmAun38NTIodA=/0x0:9000x6000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348381/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WeMo’s first video doorbell supports HomeKit and HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVcCym"&gt;And then there were three... At CES 2022 this week, Wemo announced the immediate availability of the Wemo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wdc010%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865546%2Fwemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, a HomeKit video doorbell that works with HomeKit Secure Video. It joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22318478/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-review-test-price"&gt;Logitech Circle View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168357/netatmos-smart-doorbell-apple-homekit-compatible-ces-2019"&gt;Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell camera&lt;/a&gt; as the only currently available residential HomeKit video doorbells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oLWjV"&gt;The $250 wired doorbell from the Belkin smart home brand is a short, chunky black device measuring 4.9 inches high. It has a 178-degree vertical field of view, 4MP high-resolution camera with “enhanced night vision and optimal zoom clarity,” according to the press release. It also features IP55 weatherproofing and works on 2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZbmc4rEwRXR8oIcwWPXs_sBrAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142947/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wemo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wemo Smart Video Doorbell is a chunky little fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9q4GDx"&gt;The buzzer is HomeKit only, working with the Home app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, rather than through the Wemo app, the same as the Logitech doorbell. Only the Netatmo doorbell works with its own app, too. HomeKit Secure Video requires an Apple Home hub such as a HomePod Mini, which processes video recordings locally and uses on-device intelligence to spot people, pets, or vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y67Vaq"&gt;Any recordings are stored in iCloud, so an iCloud plus plan is required for viewing recorded footage. HKSV also offers a facial recognition feature, which users train with photos from their Photos app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cpn73Y"&gt;The Wemo Smart Video Doorbell joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048434/wemo-wifi-smart-plug-small-price-stage-scene-control-home-ces-2020"&gt;Wemo Stage and Wemo Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt; as Wemo products that don’t require Wemo’s own app. It’s available to buy now at Belkin.com.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDhNqmD5nu91eD0pD1fmFYHB44o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142954/Wemo_Doorbell_product_pieces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wemo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wemo video doorbell is hardwired only and requires a wired doorbell system (16-24V AC).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAV3oB"&gt;Wemo also announced it is working on Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug, Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer to be released later this year. This will enable support for Matter over Thread. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter is the new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; launching later this year that will allow smart home devices to communicate with any Matter-enabled accessory regardless of manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIK9D5"&gt;Matter over Thread should make Wemo’s devices more reliable and easier to set up — two things I have found to be a major pain point with this brand. Thread offers faster response times than other protocols, and since it’s a mesh network, the more Thread devices in your home, the better range and connectivity you’ll have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s Soundform Immerse noise-canceling earbuds are designed with music lovers in mind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYbpQsSgeyo2WG8RvPn5WuXObLo=/0x1000:6000x5000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348847/SOUNDFORM_Immerse_Noise_Cancelling_Earbuds_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TAuziV"&gt;Belkin is adding the Immerse earbuds to its existing Soundform true wireless lineup. The earbuds come with hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, which should deliver audio free of background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GTYm727VyiJLybIKH_oG1uBrkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144207/belkin_immerse_soundform_buds.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cuy0TW"&gt;In case you haven’t heard of the “hybrid” form of ANC, &lt;a href="https://www.soundguys.com/noise-canceling-anc-explained-28344/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SoundGuys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes it as two microphones located on the inside and outside of each earbud, which detect and cancel out sound coming from your environment. The other forms of ANC put the mic on the inside &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; outside of the earbud, which isn’t always as efficient for filtering out noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b54fXg"&gt;The Immerse earbuds have a pretty long battery life as well. Each earbud is supposed to get eight hours of play time on a single charge, and when combined with the charging case, that rises to up to 36 hours. They also support aptX HD — a Bluetooth codec that transmits hi-resolution audio — along with Multipoint technology, which should let you pair the earbuds to two different devices at once. In addition, the earbuds come with 12mm drivers and are compatible with the Apple Find My app to track their location if you misplace them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9HGe8"&gt;The last time Belkin added to its True Wireless collection was in June of last year, when it released its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fspeakers-headphones%2Fheadphones%2Fsoundform-move-true-wireless-earbuds%2Fp%2Fp-pac001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866535%2Fbelkin-soundform-immerse-noise-canceling-earbuds-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;budget-friendly Move buds&lt;/a&gt;. Belkin also launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;first Find My-compatible Soundform Freedom earbuds last January&lt;/a&gt;. The Soundform Immerse noise-canceling earbuds will launch in the second quarter of 2022, but no pricing information has been made available yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s tiny Freestyle projector is fun so get over it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQXMA_LFZ4u8NcypK0IT_7cnvbg=/46x0:555x339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348778/freestyle_clip.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0zWvu"&gt;Samsung’s new barrel-shaped Freestyle projector was just announced at CES. The 1080p projector goes up for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/portable-projector/the-freestyle-sp-lsp3blaxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder today for $899&lt;/a&gt;. What matters more than its spec sheet, according to Samsung, is that this highly portable and swiveling visual lightshow with integrated speaker and voice control is coming to support your carefree “lifestyle” and nomadic “experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGv09I"&gt;Olds, in other words, need not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryOf6O"&gt;How can I be certain of this? Because when I, a curmudgeonly old, showed the Freestyle to my 13-year-old daughter under strict embargo, her first reaction was, and I quote: “I want that. A fake window on my wall would be so pretty.” A sampling of one teen is surely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jwOXMZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbFvYkjvxtg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFTRds"&gt;The 1.83 pound (0.83kg) LED projector is capable of producing an auto-focused, auto-leveled, and auto-keystoned image at sizes from 30 to 100 inches. Rated for 550 lumens,  it’s not very bright which is typical for pico-style projectors, so you’ll need a very dark room for the best image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfvrBw"&gt;The translucent lens cap can be used to create “mood lighting” that can be synced with whatever audio is playing. It also features a 360-degree five watt speaker, and a far-field mic array (for “Hi Bixby” or Alexa voice controls) that looks like it can be toggled on and off via a switch. If you look closely at the images you’ll also see one HDMI and one USB-C jack, and what looks like touch controls for power, volume, and something else encircling the lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc2vEN"&gt;The Freestyle also runs Tizen to provide the same software experience as Samsung’s smart TVs, so you’ll be pretty well set on app selection, including Netflix which many Android TV-based all-in-one projectors don’t support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kVg1gn1sb0X0sqc1L29p-oX86g8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142934/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (front).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0v-es_PsSUX93HlasmAgNcO3UFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142938/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (back).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY25xu"&gt;Optional accessories include a waterproof case, USB-C battery pack, and a base that allows the projector to be screwed into a standard E26 lightbulb socket for power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpyOyL"&gt;Freestyle seems like an ideal companion to TikTok videos, and not so much your Blu-ray collection. If you care about banalities such as lumens, supported streaming protocols, and other such minutia then this projector clearly isn’t meant for you. But for its $900 price, there’s definitely &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; expectation of good picture quality in less than ideal lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XOAgK"&gt;Samsung says preorders for the projector will open in the US as of January 4th, with the Freestyle making its way to other markets “in the following months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVH05s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 4th, 10:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article has been updated with additional specs from the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/portable-projector/the-freestyle-sp-lsp3blaxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;preorder page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and to reflect that the Freestyle offers the same software experience as Samsung’s TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
