    <title>1Password gets its own hide my email feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DT52J1eKe7YoXN29eNi9zrNIeF8=/130x0:2410x1520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919312/2_Create_alias__fill_alias.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password will let you create unique email address for each service.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 1Password&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="djW41o"&gt;1Password is launching a new feature to let users create unique email aliases for logins, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus Hide My Email function&lt;/a&gt;. 1Password is partnering with &lt;a href="https://www.fastmail.com/"&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; to bring its masked email feature to the password manager, giving all users the option of hiding their email addresses from apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYSkQO"&gt;“Your email address is your online identity,” explains Bron Gondwana, CEO of Fastmail. “If your credentials are compromised in a data breach, having a randomly generated email address adds a second line of defense because it can’t be associated with your primary email address, and therefore, your identity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g097CZymaQCBgjL6QIS-ybY0lwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884213/3_Suggested_password.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password will let you sign up to services with a unique email and password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mlgin5"&gt;This new masked email feature will be ideal for registering accounts for temporary purposes, like a free Wi-Fi network. But they can also be used to hide your personal email address from any app or service as the aliases don’t expire unless a 1Password user manually deletes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU4lYB"&gt;Email aliases already exist in Gmail, Outlook, and other email services. If your regular email address is hello@gmail.com, you can simply use hello+secrethere@gmail.com and emails will appear in your hello@gmail.com inbox. Aliases are a good way to cut down on spam, but the &lt;a href="https://www.fastmail.com/1password/"&gt;1Password Fastmail integration&lt;/a&gt; takes it a step further by making it impossible for scammers to figure out your actual email address.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJsariilmJ8q3gJR8KwiXY-Ct4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884205/4_Save_Login.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masked emails will never expire in 1Password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IzQumx"&gt;Attackers often use leaked databases of reused passwords and email addresses to phish people, but they need both your email address and password to access a service. Victims of a leaked data breach are at less risk if both their password and email address are unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grjwqb"&gt;Services like &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; have been tracking data breaches for years, and affected email addresses often appear in more than just one breach. “My service is now tracking 5 billion email addresses with each one appearing in an average of 2 data breaches,” says Troy Hunt, the founder of &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; and strategic advisor at 1Password. “It’s more important than ever that we protect our privacy; and protecting the primary key to our digital lives – our email address – will have a really positive impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There might be more to come from buzzy VR theme park The Void</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-TECHNOLOGY-THE VOID" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5WNtrVCV1ppzjm-nSg_VGaHa70=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919246/1006824744.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Void attendees wearing the the company’s headsets and VR backpacks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: VERONIQUE DUPONT/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8BY3ZD"&gt;VR arcade company The Void, which offered large-scale virtual reality experiences before financial difficulties forced it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570662/the-void-disney-star-wars-vr-arcade-loan-default"&gt;transfer its IP to a creditor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, is planning to make a comeback. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/the-void-relaunch-hyper-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s assets have been acquired by a new company called Hyper Reality Partners, headed by a former investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqgwoU"&gt;The Void emerged as one of the more exciting VR arcade startups in recent years. With Disney as one of its highest-profile investors, the company offered large-scale multiplayer VR experiences, with some based on Hollywood franchises like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/3/16084460/star-wars-secrets-of-the-empire-disney-the-void-virtual-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/16/17867110/the-void-wreck-it-ralph-breaks-vr-marvel-studios-disney-lucasfilm-ilm-virtual-reality-immersion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wreck-It Ralph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897061/avengers-void-vr-black-panther-iron-man-shuri-tony-stark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Attendees would strap on a modified VR headset and a backpack containing a computer to power it, and then walk around an environment that included interactable physical elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y8jVO8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It wants to “shape the future of VR and the entire entertainment industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UMkYeG"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://the-void.breezy.hr/"&gt;job listings site&lt;/a&gt; from Hyper Reality Partners confirms that the company has acquired The Void’s “assets and IP” and says that it’s now “entering a period of rapid expansion” with ambitions to “shape the future of VR and the entire entertainment industry.” &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reports that the company, headed by CEO Adrian Steckel, a former investor and board member of The Void, has raised $20 million for the relaunch. Joining Steckel are The Void’s old chief creative officer and VP of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWPH2y"&gt;Despite plenty of buzz, the startup found itself in financial difficulty last year after the pandemic forced it to close many of its locations. But &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was experiencing difficulties before this, thanks to the high cost of hosting VR centers in popular shopping centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOIp1F"&gt;The Void’s experiences might look very different if they do end up making a return. For starters, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that the company is looking to shift to offering experiences in large standalone entertainment complexes, rather than in pre-existing shopping malls. The VR hardware itself could also undergo changes thanks to the fact that much of its previous hardware was reportedly sold off, while the industry has also moved towards lighter standalone VR headsets that don’t require large backpacks for power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Facebook should release the Facebook Files</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hxygre4vhZEegWeekXaqKzlGAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919074/VRG_ILLO_4033_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company’s least-bad option might also do a lot of good&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T8MCqZ"&gt;The fallout from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt; series continues. On Sunday, the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;published a point-by-point rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s story on Instagram’s effects on teenage girls — and then on Monday morning, the company said&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt; it would “pause” plans to build Instagram Kids&lt;/a&gt; while it consults with more outside groups. A Senate hearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;looms on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTKaiF"&gt;I spent the weekend talking to people in and around Facebook about the situation, and today I want to talk about what I think the company ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0rsiW"&gt;Inside Facebook, some people I’ve spoken with are feeling exasperated. They argue that the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;series uses relatively few data points to paint Facebook in the worst possible light. To them, it’s more evidence of bias from a press working to bring the company to its knees, reaching predetermined conclusions with whatever scraps of information they can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mI80y2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For others, the Facebook Files have been a welcome opportunity to discuss their greatest fear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akw4rx"&gt;For others, though, particularly those who have worked on research and integrity initiatives, the Facebook Files have been a welcome opportunity to discuss their greatest fear: that despite researchers’ most worrisome findings, Facebook lacks the organizational structure and leadership necessary to prevent it from causing a wide range of preventable harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79Sja"&gt;Last week I said this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688976/facebook-research-scandals"&gt;situation represents Facebook’s most significant challenge since the Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; data privacy scandal. It’s not as &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; as Cambridge Analytica; the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; series has gotten less coverage overall. (Though that Senate hearing means the balance will continue to shift.) But if another story has generated a news cycle this intense or sustained since 2018, it’s news to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ud2lwJ"&gt;In the internal divisions over the Facebook Files, though, I find another echo of Cambridge Analytica. Then, too, there was a set of executives determined to fight back against what they perceived as an almost entirely bogus narrative — and another set that, while mostly in agreement with their peers, understood that the story had raised real fears about the company’s power and influence that would have to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtI45l"&gt;Last week I argued here that Facebook ought to address this situation by committing to doing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; research like that found in the Facebook Files, rather than less. We know Facebook executives believe that the company has positive overall benefits for the world, and we also know that they are meticulous students of their own data. It’s hard to understand why, if the data is so positive, Facebook is often so reluctant to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGSNCS"&gt;So why is that the case? One possibility is suggested by the Facebook Files: that the data about Facebook’s effects on societal issues like polarization, vaccine hesitancy, and children’s self-esteem are substantially negative, and must therefore be hidden. Another is that the data is substantially positive but must be hidden anyway, for reasons owing to run-of-the-mill corporate secrecy or a desire to deploy data more strategically, for PR reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6CU3G"&gt;Whatever the case, it seems clear that the current state of affairs is making everyone miserable. So today I want to expand my argument: Not only should Facebook commit to doing more research like the Facebook Files, it should release the Facebook Files, period. And not just the Instagram-related ones, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1442538461890744325?s=21"&gt;as Nick Clegg suggested Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever documents the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; relied on, Facebook should make them publicly available. Redact them as needed to protect users’ privacy, if need be. Add context, where context is missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYjLse"&gt;But release them, and soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plJsfL"&gt;Here’s my rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtUNr"&gt;One, the files are in the public interest. Among other things, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, they contain discussions of political parties who &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;changed their policies based on changes to Facebook’s algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, they document &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;negative effects of using Instagram on mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and they reveal that the company &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline"&gt;devotes vastly more moderation resources to the United States than the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;. On these subjects and more, the public simply has a right to know what Facebook does. One frustration I’ve had over the past week is that Facebook continues to be focused on the public-relations dimension of the story, when the public interest is much more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoW0KS"&gt;Two, the files will likely come out soon anyway: the whistleblower who leaked them to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; is apparently cooperating with Congress. Copies were shown in advance of publication to various researchers. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; may yet release them itself (I wish it would.) In any case, it seems likely that they are going to be available for all of us to read soon. Facebook could generate some (admittedly minor) amount of goodwill by doing it voluntarily. (Company spokesman Andy Stone told me&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1442274768061812736?s=21"&gt; the company is sharing the decks with Congress this week&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iXgybs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If they’re being taken out of context, provide the context&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQbz9E"&gt;Three, Facebook’s primary complaint about the series is that reporters allegedly&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience"&gt; took key points out of context&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to credibly make that charge is to provide people with the full context. It’s not enough for the company’s head of research to describe one set of slides; to have an honest conversation about all this, we should all be looking at the same set of documents. If, as Facebook says, the majority of the research shows benign or even positive effects, it should have all the more reason to want us to read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvZVng"&gt;To be sure, the people inside Facebook arguing against the documents’ release have compelling points on their side, too. As soon as the files are made public, every tech reporter on earth will scour them in an effort to find angles that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; missed, extending the life of the story and perhaps even worsening the damage. Even if there are positive angles to be found within the data, there’s no guarantee that reporters will actually write them. And a narrow-minded focus on these documents crowds out a larger and equally important discussion of why we aren’t demanding similar research out of YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPIzLI"&gt;Moreover, the company was taken aback by the largely negative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;its Sunday night blog post received&lt;/a&gt;, I’m told. (I was&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1442264175128969219?s=21"&gt; one of the people negatively responding&lt;/a&gt;. So was Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook’s just-departed former head of civic integrity efforts, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1442363126821769219?s=21"&gt; pointed out&lt;/a&gt; the blog post would have been more credible if it had been signed by the actual researchers who did the analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Q4Q5J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'd find blog posts like this much more persuasive if they were co-authored by the individual researchers who actually did the analysis. That would be a signal that they are willing to stand behind the comms team's characterization of their work. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2sO0UqedDQ"&gt;https://t.co/2sO0UqedDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samidh (@samidh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1442363126821769219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CkTBrS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;The Sunday blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Pratiti Raychoudhury, the company’s head of research, is detailed and thoughtful in the way that it reflects on both the good and bad news in the company’s studies on how young Instagram users feel about themselves after using the app. The data is mixed, and people will draw different conclusions from it. The fact that so many critics dismissed her report out of hand, though, may have made the company reluctant to share more. &lt;em&gt;If this is the response we get&lt;/em&gt;, the argument goes, &lt;em&gt;what’s the point&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpexJZ"&gt;But none of these complaints is more important than the fact that sharing this data with the public is ultimately &lt;em&gt;the right thing to do&lt;/em&gt;. And it will be better for Facebook to share it on its own terms than on Congress’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLq9wS"&gt;And if Facebook &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to change perception, it could go a step further. Releasing the Facebook Files quickly is the company’s least-bad option. But the company knows that outside researchers will be skeptical of any findings they contain, because they can’t see the raw data. Even to the extent that the files exonerate Facebook from some criticisms, the underlying data is likely to remain under a cloud of suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sQoLNK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s get a second, third, and fourth opinion of what the data shows about Instagram and teenagers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dYWbLr"&gt;That’s why, in addition to making the files public, Facebook should share the underlying data with qualified independent researchers in a privacy-preserving way. Let’s get a second, third, and fourth opinion of what the data shows about Instagram and teenagers. Given the recent revelation that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/10/facebook-error-data-social-scientists/"&gt;political-science data shared with researchers in 2020 was fatally flawed due to a bug&lt;/a&gt;, an unexpected gift of important new research material could help the company rebuild trust with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8qfp7"&gt;Not everyone thinks this would be much of a gift: anyone can survey teens about their experiences on Instagram, after all, and among other things an independent study could recruit a larger sample. But to the extent that data in the Facebook Files can’t be easily accessed or replicated by independent researchers, Facebook should share as much as it can. The company’s efforts to share data with researchers to date have been halting and ineffectual. More transparency is coming to the platform one way or another; there’s still value in staking out a leadership position while the rest of the industry cowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRqb7x"&gt;I say release the Facebook Files for short-term goodwill, and release at least some of the data to qualified researchers for long-term credibility. Since it was founded, Facebook has relentlessly analyzed our actions and behavior, to its great benefit. However unjust it may feel today, it’s only fair that the company now take its turn under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXOo0O"&gt;Popular image-sharing site Imgur has &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/We6yCM2"&gt;been acquired by MediaLab&lt;/a&gt;, a Santa Monica-based firm that describes itself as a “holding company of consumer internet brands.” The company owns a number of B-list tech and internet services, including messaging apps Kik and Whisper, lyrics annotator Genius, and viral video aggregator WorldStarHipHop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eChxds"&gt;Imgur, which currently claims some 300 million users, says the move will help the company “keep the main Imgur team focused on what we do best: creating the best place for community-powered entertainment online.” In a &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/We6yCM2"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said “Imgur’s journey is far from over” and that MediaLab is committing to “investing more resources in engineering and community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WSVFsv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MediaLab has bought a number of also-ran brands with sizable communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qNg6v"&gt;What exactly the acquisition means for the future of Imgur is unclear, but it’s hard to read this as positive news for the site. MediaLab isn’t explicit about its business model (you won’t find much information on &lt;a href="https://www.medialab.la/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;), but it seems to be mainly focused on acquiring ailing brands with sizable, but stagnant, communities. Presumably, the goal is to bundle together traffic from these properties to sell ads or data, while cutting costs by sharing the work of keeping the sites running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eumCx"&gt;For example, the once-hyped Genius was bought by MediaLab &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/former-startup-darling-genius-sells-assets-for-80-million"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; for $80 million, reportedly less than what it had raised in venture capital over the years. Kik and Whisper were similarly once-hot properties that have since faded from prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMX1VB"&gt;Imgur itself has had a strange ride as a company. It was founded in 2009 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting/"&gt;gift to Reddit&lt;/a&gt;,” and its fortunes have risen and fallen along with this partnership. In 2016, Reddit decided to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/25/reddit-image-uploads/"&gt;host its own image uploads&lt;/a&gt;, and in response Imgur began to form itself into a standalone online community. It copied various social features popular on Reddit, including upvotes and downvotes on images, comment threads, and focused communities. The site has frequently been compared to other image-hosting services that grew adjacent to larger social media sites, such as Twitpic, but has so far laster longer on its own strengths. In recent years it has launched new features like an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373988/imgur-emerald-subscription-service-announced-coil-micropayments"&gt;ad-free subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3foFgt"&gt;Imgur’s blog post announcing the acquisition reads like something close to a farewell note — “It’s been an absolute honor to create this corner of the internet alongside this incredible community” — though the company insists its “journey is far from over.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9w7DO"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTSIwZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android ‘12.1’ could be a big foldable-focused update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8OdJ8SFn1epyOijRKkEriIgrxg=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919029/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A redesigned lock screen could make better use of horizontal space.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7yC0QO"&gt;Big foldable-focused improvements are on the way for Android, if leaked code &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;analyzed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-v2-update/"&gt;Previous reports&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that this year’s Android 12 is going to be followed by a minor revision, which is expected to be called Android 12.1 based on previous naming conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QafWK8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis suggests this update may deliver a host of improvements for how the operating system handles large foldable-sized screens, including offering a better split-screen UI, a lockscreen that makes better use of horizontal space, and a new taskbar that makes it easier to use multiple apps at once. They’re helpful additions that should reduce the need for manufacturers like Samsung to build their own foldable-focused UI improvements on top of Android for their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbzYpIGNs8Nn9ZIr_ge74H-Qess=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884146/Android_12.1_dual_pane_notifications_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewing Android’s Quick Settings and notifications panel simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwQpKQ"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;XDA’s&lt;/em&gt; analysis notes, most of the improvements relate to how the operating system makes better use of more horizontal screen real estate. For example, it allows the Quick Settings and notifications panels to be displayed simultaneously side-by-side (rather than one-at-a-time), while the lock screen can now be split to show the clock on one side and notifications on the other. When it comes time to enter a PIN or password, this can now be placed on the left or right of the display (rather than centered) to allow it to be entered with one hand on a foldable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElMCrV"&gt;Android 12.1 is also designed to make it easier to use apps in split-screen. There’s a new shortcut in the recent apps menu to open an app in split-screen mode, rather than having to long press an app’s icon. Meanwhile, a new taskbar on the bottom of the screen can also be used to open recent apps in split-screen mode by dragging and dropping them onto either half of the screen. &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;reports that it might eventually be possible to drag notifications to open their apps in split-screen mode. Finally, the Settings app also appears to be getting a new interface that allows top-level menu items to be displayed on the left, while its submenus open on the right half of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9udA6aBjhBIGRYXMDS327gGtFj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884143/Android_12.1_split_screen_UI_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A taskbar with access to recent apps on the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="78Z92c"&gt;Other non-foldable focused enhancements include being able to tweak the amount of time you have to hold the power button to activate the Google Assistant, and making it easier for manufacturers other than Google to match their system colors to Android 12’s lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rvt3jl"&gt;Google is yet to officially announce anything resembling Android 12.1, nor has it even released Android 12 to the general public. That means the features detailed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; could change a lot before they’re released, if they’re ever released at all. But combined with the persistent rumors about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google releasing a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; this year, it’s looking increasingly likely that we’ll see some of these features arrive sooner rather than later. Be sure to check out the full list of changes &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;over on &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhAAjQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s MX Keys Mini ditches the numpad for other useful keys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R_sVMwy530cGDgXNHtsv8GI2QjU=/0x0:1570x1047/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918951/mxkeysminihero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The function row has dedicated emoji, voice dictation and mic mute keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KNMukU"&gt;Logitech’s MX Keys Mini is a compact, platform-agnostic wireless keyboard that lacks the numpad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel"&gt;found on the standard MX Keys&lt;/a&gt;. It costs the same amount at $99.99 despite its smaller size, yet there might be enough additions to make this one the preferable option (you know, if spending $100 on a keyboard is feasible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUzvYT"&gt;Logitech added a dedicated emoji key to the top row of Mini’s function keys that lets you add some personality to your messages, in addition to a voice dictation key and a mic mute key that mutes on a system level, not per application. Joining them on the function row are media and volume keys, along with an option to adjust the brightness of the keyboard backlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aX1q5z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJ1WFVLTkD0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0Lx1"&gt;The MX Keys Mini charges via USB-C and can flip between three Bluetooth devices via keys that easily let you switch. But something you should know about this model is that it doesn’t ship with Logitech’s unifying USB receiver, and it won’t work with one you might already have. It’s a Bluetooth-only affair, though it is compatible with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Flogi-bolt-usb-receiver.956-000007.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22687565%2Flogitech-mx-keys-mini-wireless-keyboard-features-price-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s new $14.99 Bolt USB receiver&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651973/logitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories"&gt;lowers latency and adds more security&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpZxS"&gt;The MX Keys Mini shares a number of other features in common with the MX Keys. Its concave, matte-textured keys offer a pretty great typing experience. It also has backlighting that kicks on automatically when your hands appear over the keyboard, turning off a few seconds after you pull away. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmk7VDnWl3lKimDdC04qg9-77Rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873081/mxkeysminicolors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available in three colorways. The MX Keys Mini for Mac comes only in the leftmost grey and white option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RsHhnY"&gt;The default version of the MX Keys Mini shows both Windows and macOS commands, and it’s also compatible with Chrome OS, Linux, Android, iOS, and iPadOS. It comes in three colorways: rose, pale gray, and graphite. If you’re a dedicated Apple user who’d rather not have start and alt buttons, Logitech makes a version that’s just for macOS and other Apple products. It’s the same price, but it comes in just the pale grey colorway, which resembles Apple’s older desktop keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFe3cQ"&gt;Logitech claims that the MX Keys Mini can deliver up to 10 days of battery life with the backlighting turned on, as it is by default. Though, it can apparently last up to five months with the backlighting off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrzbZR"&gt;You certainly don’t need to spend $99.99 to get a decent wireless keyboard with scissor switches. But the price for the MX Keys Mini might be easier to justify if you use multiple devices at your setup, and especially if you use the MX Master or Anywhere mouse. When used alongside one of those, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/1/15715236/logitech-mx-master-2s-anywhere-mouse-flow-multiple-computer-support"&gt;Logitech’s Flow feature lets you move files between macOS and Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo confirms Donkey Kong area for Super Nintendo World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHRAD0-F77hft53a0vF1sg4YBMA=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918843/snw.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWLP5v"&gt;Nintendo has confirmed plans to expand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;, its recently opened theme park at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, with a new Donkey Kong area. The news doesn’t exactly come as a surprise — construction already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605383/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-construction"&gt;appears to have been underway&lt;/a&gt; for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCxyF8"&gt;Imagery released by Nintendo confirms that, as speculated, the Donkey Kong zone will indeed be accessed through a large round door that already exists in the park, which is currently almost entirely Mario-themed. The zone will be a significant addition that increases Super Nintendo World’s overall size by about 70 percent, according to Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aQPSk-j_qiw1-WHRnh5e0753Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884061/img_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A map showing the location of the new Donkey Kong area within Super Nintendo World.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krXKGx"&gt;The Donkey Kong zone will include “a roller coaster, interactive experiences and themed merchandise and food,” Nintendo says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210928.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Guests will be able to take a walk on the wild side through the lush jungles where Donkey Kong and his friends live.“ Nintendo goes on to describe the area as “a gamechanger that combines the innovative technology and globally popular approach to theme park entertainment of Universal with the creativity of Nintendo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dx3JIu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Nintendo World is sensory overload","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jm9G9V"&gt;“I am very happy to be able to make the world of Donkey Kong a reality following the world of Mario,” says Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Donkey Kong and Mario characters. “I am looking forward to creating a thrilling Donkey Kong experience with the amazing team at Universal. It will take some time until it is completed, but it will be a unique area for not only people who are familiar with Donkey Kong games, but for all guests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvO60i"&gt;The new area is planned to open in 2024, at which point hopefully it’ll be actually possible to travel to Japan. Nintendo-themed areas are also in the works for the Orlando, Hollywood, and Singapore Universal Studios parks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump pushing Microsoft to buy TikTok was ‘strangest thing I’ve ever worked on,’ says Satya Nadella</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spA-QRAWrOpenYvKmDnYyZ76A5M=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918452/REC_ASA2_CODE21_20210927_182752_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella | Asa Mathat / Recode&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OA1OkF"&gt;It’s difficult to remember now, but in August 2020 there was a deeply surreal episode wherein &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21352004/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-trump-bytedance"&gt;Microsoft proposed acquiring some portion of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354255/microsoft-tiktok-trump-ban-bytedance-china-us-canada"&gt;complicated deal&lt;/a&gt; as the Trump administration was threatening to come down hard on the platform. Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;TikTok turned Microsoft down&lt;/a&gt; just a day before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436035/tiktok-oracle-deal-bytedance-president-trump-safety"&gt;Oracle came in with an entirely different kind of deal&lt;/a&gt; and the whole thing dissipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6ckkA"&gt;Speaking today at &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;the Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the whole ordeal was the “strangest thing I’ve ever sort of worked on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt9hI3"&gt;In terms of the value of such a deal for Microsoft, Nadella said he “was kind of intrigued by it,” before trying to move right along with a laugh, deadpanning after a pause “and then I guess the rest is history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Gxlo"&gt;Kara Swisher pressed him for the story and Nadella, clearly still a little agog at the strangeness, walked through a few of the key steps. The important start is that “TikTok came to us, we didn’t come to TikTok,” he says. The company was looking for a US partner to help with “these security things we seem to [have been] hearing about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWygDQ"&gt;Nadella thought TikTok might have been a good fit because it was a social, cloud-based service that heavily leveraged AI, all areas of focus for the company. “It is an interesting product,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBm2Ed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkGDsq"&gt;Nadella’s contention is that Microsoft would have been an interesting partner for TikTok because of its established work with “investments in social media, in particular what we’re doing in content moderation and child safety.” Those strengths — plus the key fact that it is a US-based cloud services provider — were seen to be key to assuaging the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N13v5w"&gt;“There was a period of time when I though the the [US government] had a particular set of requirements, [but] it just disappeared,” Nadella says. “President Trump I think had a particular point of view of what he was trying to get done ...and then just dropped off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdT3pT"&gt;TikTok ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;let Microsoft know&lt;/a&gt; that it wouldn’t be moving forward with the deal in September. Later in the year, days ahead of a deadline Trump set for parent company ByteDance to sell off its US assets, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the administration had forgotten about the ban altogether. President Biden ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the order this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEcr9B"&gt;“At this point, it’s all moot, right?” Nadella says. He says he hasn’t followed up on what’s going on with TikTok and Oracle. (Hint: it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;shelved indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;.) Would he like to buy TikTok now if it came back on the table? “No,” Nadella says, “at this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD CEO Lisa Su downplays the company’s role in crypto mining</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVIbwI"&gt;Can’t get a new graphics card for your PC? You might be tempted to blame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372721/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-midnight-black-ebay-scalpers"&gt;bots, scalpers&lt;/a&gt; or cryptocurrency miners for that — but AMD CEO Lisa Su is downplaying the impact of crypto at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; today. When asked about how big a deal crypto is for the chipmaker, she told the audience that it’s a rather small part of AMD’s business, called it “a pretty volatile space,” and suggested that it shouldn’t be a focus for AMD going forward either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf2klE"&gt;That’s not a particularly surprising stance for several reasons. First, what upside there was for GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia has drastically shrunk — GPU prices have slowly been dropping amidst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading'"&gt;China’s cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt;, which only got stronger this past week as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691472/china-central-bank-cryptocurrency-illegal-bitcoin"&gt;China’s central bank officially banned cryptocurrency transactions entirely&lt;/a&gt;. There have been reports of mass GPU sell-offs from mining regions going back months, although prices are still quite high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9tMyZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A few reasons why Su isn’t going to boost crypto right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XNFTH"&gt;Second, if she were to publicly say she supports AMD chasing crypto sales, that could be a really unpopular look when it comes to AMD’s hyper-vocal audience of gamers who believe that every sale to a crypto miner is a sale at their expense — and who also drive purchases of desktop CPUs and motherboards for AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNbU5L"&gt;Su made it very clear in her reply at the Code Conference that gamers are top of mind: “We are trying really hard to get more products to gamers; I get so many ‘Dear Lisa, can you help me get a gaming card?’” she said. AMD already took some flak from gamers when it revealed &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-cryptocurrency-mining-limiter-ethereum/"&gt;it wouldn’t block mining workloads with its new GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day we’re building for sort of consumer applications, and that’s where the focus is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OB4r5F"&gt;But third, AMD may just not have a large enough supply of GPUs to tempt miners to begin with. While we don’t know how many current-gen GPUs the company has actually shipped, there are many signs that the company has sold precious few of them compared to its rival Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4q0gZ"&gt;It’s far rarer to see an AMD GPU in stock, there are far fewer of them changing hands on sites like eBay, and not even one AMD GPU has broken into &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam"&gt;Steam’s Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a rough glimpse at how many of them have made it into PC gamers’ hands. Over 6 percent of gaming PCs included in the survey have one of the Nvidia 3000-series GPUs, but there isn’t a single recent AMD GPU on the list, which suggests none of them have accumulated more than a 0.15 percent share of Steam gamers. When Su says that crypto is “not a large piece of our business,” it’s possible she also means that new desktop GPUs are not a large piece of AMD’s business. Su did say in May that AMD was having to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;prioritize some components over others&lt;/a&gt;, though she didn’t mention GPUs specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGrFZh"&gt;Speaking of shortages, Su also addressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the ongoing global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; onstage, reiterating that supplies will be “tight” this year and “likely tight” the first half of next year, but that “it’ll get better in 2022” as additional production capacity comes online. “It gets better next year, not immediately, but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up,” she told the attendees at Code Conference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reveals plans for massive EV and battery factories in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_1p2Qfrx3kXJS0GvzZusuxV5f4=/169x0:1992x1215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917844/Blue_Oval_City_16x9_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3RuXOV"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation will spend a combined $11.4 billion to build several new factories in the Tennessee and Kentucky focused on the development and production of electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbjnJ8"&gt;The new facilities represent the first new plants built by Ford, completely from scratch, in over 50 years. The Tennessee plant will be a “mega campus” that houses a vehicle-production facility for Ford’s F-series pickup trucks and a battery assembly division, while the twin factories in Kentucky will manufacture lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuZiSQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is show, not tell time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4moH0o"&gt;The facilities won’t come online until 2025, but Ford CEO Jim Farley says the investment signals the seriousness with which the company is taking its commitment to EVs. The new campus in Stanton, Tennessee, for example, will cover nine square miles and represents the largest facility ever built in the company’s 118-year history, Farley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLkwy9"&gt;“This is a new Ford,” Farley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is show, not tell time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U700BY"&gt;Ford, like the rest of the auto industry, is scrambling to shift its attention to EVs, even as they only represent a small fraction of vehicles sold every year. The announcement comes as Congress is debating whether to approve an infrastructure deal that would fund the construction of hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;new charging stations&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new consumer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669809/honda-toyota-criticize-democrats-proposed-tax-credit-union-made-electric-vehicles"&gt;incentives for EV sales&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes as the auto industry grapples with new proposals banning the sale of gas cars in foreign markets and some US states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;like California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtLWKE1TmJDZbuQcdxykuATnZM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638200/akrales_20210526_4595_0085.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFXtiQI_3ADfeQocD71ITegXtAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280373/sokane_210125_4386_1765.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv7myT"&gt;Farley made the analogy that electric cars are now at a similar place as smartphones in 2007. “This story ... is not about propulsion,” Farley said. “This story is about digital vehicles with embedded systems, and a customer experience led through software that gets better every day, and changes the definition of a car from something that gets you from point A to point B, to something that enables your full life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCUbE1"&gt;The new facilities represent a shift in Ford’s approach to EV manufacturing. It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards in the future if the company can successfully supplement production from its own suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neDRMO"&gt;Ford currently sources its batteries from SK Innovation, which recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries in the US, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="poQtW3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford CEO Jim Farley on building the electric F-150 — and reinventing Ford","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2TNO85"&gt;Farley estimates that Ford will need 140GWh of battery manufacturing capacity a year, and in total, the company’s three new battery plants will enable 129 gigawatt-hours (GWh) a year of production capacity. By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem for a total annual capacity of 140GWh, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating in Europe by 2030 for a total of 240GWh a year. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt; would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnmC1"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XD5QQy"&gt;Farley said Ford’s contribution to the massive investments in battery capacity will be significant because of its status as maker of the F-150 pickup truck, which has been the most popular vehicle in the US for decades. “This is different than Tesla and the other announcements [because] this is enormous scale,” he said. “America’s best selling vehicles going electric. We’re totally sold out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPKQbe"&gt;Ford says it will spend $7 billion, while SK Innovation will contribute $4.4 billion, for a total of $11.4 billion. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;Ford has said it would spend $30 billion by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that 40 percent of its global fleet will be electric by 2030. The company is currently at work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;retrofitting its historic Rouge factory&lt;/a&gt; for the production of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8rIdrRYw_IerpqoGmL_ksutCeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882601/Blue_Oval_City_05.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Oval City will cost $5.6 billion and generate 6,000 new jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AFGtBE"&gt;The “mega campus” in Stanton, Tennessee, will be called Blue Oval City. At a cost of $5.6 billion, the facility will generate approximately 6,000 new jobs, Ford says. Blue Oval City will become a “vertically integrated ecosystem” for Ford’s assembly of an expanded lineup of electric F-series vehicles. It will also include a battery plant, key suppliers, and recycling. (Ford recently struck a deal with Redwood Materials, a battery recycler founded by a former top executive from Tesla.) Ford said that Blue Oval City is also designed to be carbon neutral with “zero waste to landfill” once fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="521erF"&gt;In central Kentucky, Ford plans to build a “dedicated battery manufacturing complex” with SK Innovation. Dubbed the BlueOvalSK Battery Park, the complex will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs. Batteries for the company’s next-generation Ford and Lincoln EVs will be assembled at the site’s twin battery plants. The construction money will flow from a new joint venture called BlueOvalSK (which is still subject to “regulatory approvals and other conditions,” Ford says).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeYkWP0Kg17vmqqMYon9LGeBdrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882602/BlueOvalSK_Battery_Park_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueOvalSK Battery Park will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LPGQDJ"&gt;Ford projects that it will create a total of 11,000 new jobs in the two states. As such, the company says it is prepared to spend $525 million on a nationwide job training program, starting with $90 million on a pilot project in Texas. The hope is to train the next generation of workers on the intricacies of EV manufacturing and maintenance, not only to work at Ford’s factories but also at its dealerships and to make repairs in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpgZVf"&gt;“Our industry has an enormous shortage of technicians,” Farley said. “We need to recruit a huge number of technicians who are good at doing service on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fK7Ij5"&gt;Ford is receiving financial incentives from both states in exchange for agreeing to build there. Tennessee and Kentucky are also both contributing money in the form of training grants to ensure that future workers have the necessary skills. But Farley said the primary consideration was finding locations with competitive energy rates, since a battery plant uses five times the energy of a traditional assembly plant. Ford also prioritized finding “greenfield” sites with no prior environmental issues so that it could build quickly. “We need to move fast,” said Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nm9WFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUc85"&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps. This week, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;issued two recalls for its Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, after determining that the adhesive used to attach the windshield and optional glass roof wasn’t secure enough. It was the Mach-E’s second recall, after an earlier investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;discovering loose subframe bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Customer deliveries of the Mach-E were delayed, too, after the company discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;software problem that led to the 12-volt battery dying&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkcTig"&gt;When asked about the recalls, Farley acknowledged that Ford has “a lot of work to do as a company around quality” and added “we have to get it right.” He also employed a baseball metaphor that he is fond of using in media interviews. “This is the first inning,” he said. “But boy, the demand is strong. And people absolutely love this car. We just have to make it better every day. And that’s on us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctwkOw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzfhq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
