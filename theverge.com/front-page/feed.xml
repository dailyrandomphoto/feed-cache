    <title>OnePlus Nord N10 5G and N100 are coming to the US on January 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v457j4-eMg1RmWKd_qMOe1tvsBs=/0x24:1080x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621543/Still_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KyUvC3"&gt;The original&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt; OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt; skipped North America, but OnePlus is finally bringing two cheaper, mid-range options from its Nord line to the US and Canada on January 15th. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers flagship standards like a high-refresh rate 90Hz display and fast charging for $299.99 ($389 CAD), while the OnePlus Nord N100 features an even larger display and battery for $179.99 ($239 CAD). After&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534004/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-n100-price-news-features-specs-battery-quad-triple-cameras"&gt; launching in Europe last year&lt;/a&gt;, both phones are now carrier-exclusives for T-Mobile and available unlocked from OnePlus and other online retailers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JtX1J"&gt;The N10 5G’s 6.49-inch high-refresh rate display, 128GB of expandable storage, and 30W fast charging make it similar to the original Nord. Where it differs is with its lower-tier Snapdragon 690 processor, an LCD screen instead of OLED, and 6GB instead of 8GB of RAM. The N10 5G does still feature four rear cameras, though: a 64-megapixel main camera, and wide-angle, macro and monochrome cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdhqGjPdbn2E3yyUW-Kz9C3KX44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989022/N10_Still.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="naJ6lk"&gt;As its name suggests, the N10 5G supports 5G networks. The handset is limited to potentially slower low and mid-band 5G in the US, but should have better range and coverage than phones that only support millimeter wave 5G. Notably, the N10 5G doesn’t support mmWave 5G at all, OnePlus confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;the difficulty we’ve had with mmWave 5G on other phones&lt;/a&gt;, that might still be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IHhySBrjtz9s46rdUd3u-3h4VNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989021/N100_Still.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord N100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tM9DEq"&gt;The cheaper N100 is a slight step down in features from the N10 5G, firstly because it only works with 4G. Its larger (but lower-resolution) 6.52-inch display and 5,000 mAh battery (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;larger than the OnePlus 8T&lt;/a&gt;) also make it less comparable to the Nord, and really brings it into the realm of an inexpensive battery-focused phone like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;. The Snapdragon 460 and 64GB starting expandable storage mark this as a decidedly budget phone, which makes sense given the price. The N100 also only features 18W fast charging, around half what the N10 5G and Nord can handle. For cameras, The N100 has three on the back instead of four, with a 13-megapixel main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtxLIv"&gt;Both phones run Android 10 skinned with OxygenOS, and OnePlus says that they’ll be updated to Android 11 at some point in the future. OnePlus is also guaranteeing two years of security updates for each handset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wS46l"&gt;In terms of price, the phones cost less than we expected and come in under the original Nord’s price of £379 (around $484). They might not be using the same “recipe” as the original, but a lower price is always worth considering. You’ll be able to purchase the N10 5G and the N100 from OnePlus’ carrier partners T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, or unlocked from OnePlus, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H. The phones will be available at OnePlus’ website on January 15th at 10:00AM ET, with pre-sale beginning on January 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s latest Latitude business laptops add an automated webcam shutter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vExrqAoE_4KuBVfuGHkOuuUDMvs=/0x466:4000x3133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621598/Dell_Latitude__9420_3_view.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Dell Latitude 9420 | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLfYEq"&gt;CES has almost arrived, and Dell is kicking things off with some new versions of its Latitude laptops (designed for business customers), led by the new Latitude 9420 and 9520. The devices will add Intel’s new 11th Gen vPro chips (once available in March 2021) and new features like an automated, integrated webcam shutter to physically block your camera when it’s not in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mUgMp"&gt;Dubbed “SafeShutter,” the new optional webcam system is an almost blindingly obvious addition, especially considering the shift in focus to videoconferencing in the past year as businesses have been forced to transition to remote work. The shutter can open and close automatically when the webcam is in use, but there are also “mute” keys to manually disable the microphone or camera as needed. Anyone who’s ever stuck a sliding shutter or taped over their webcam for security concerns should be able to see the benefit of an automatic, integrated setup here, and it’s something that will hopefully extend to other laptops in Dell’s lineup in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xS9TGzIrybH5ESTciyHSyXyfHOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214849/Latitude_9420_2_in_1_SafeShutter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera system on the Latitude 9420.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WqgWNy"&gt;The other big update is the option to get Intel’s new 11th Gen vPro chips — the Latitude 9420 can be configured with up to a Core i7 model — bringing the benefits of Intel’s newest chips (including its powerful integrated Iris Xe graphics) to the new models. The updated 14-inch model will come in either a 2560 x 1600 2-in-1 form factor or a lower-resolution 1080p laptop configuration. RAM goes up to 32GB, while storage can be configured with up to a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD. Lastly, the 9420 will offer both optional 5G or LTE support through Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X20 (for LTE) or X55 (for 5G and LTE) modems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KddkYT"&gt;Dell will also have an updated model of the larger 15.6-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Latitude 9510&lt;/a&gt; — called, fittingly, the Latitude 9520 — available spring 2021, which will offer similar improvements, including the webcam shutter and the new 11th Gen commercial Intel chips. And given how impressive the battery life was on the 9510, it’ll be interesting to see how Dell does now that it has the benefit of the vPro versions of Intel’s 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1AGMu"&gt;The Latitude 9420 will start at $1,949, while the Latitude 9520 has yet to get any pricing information announced. Both will be available this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gLtZQjTa7-qSErJY7pl5wSgEko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214851/Latitude_7320_2_in_1_tent_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell Latitude 7320.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cTTkmX"&gt;Dell is also upgrading its Latitude 7000 and Latitude 5000 lineups. The 7000 series receives a new model, the Latitude 7520, adding the option of a 15.6-inch configuration for the first time (alongside the 13.3-inch 7320 and 14-inch 7420 models, which are updated versions of last year’s versions). The new 7520, 7420, and 7320 models will also be configured with Intel’s 11th Gen vPro chips, offer up to 32GB of RAM, and a new, smaller design. Dell also says that it’s upgraded the camera and audio quality for better videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qirOLQ"&gt;As expected, some of the more premium features of the 9420 and 9520 are missing here, though: the 7000 models can only be configured with LTE, not 5G, and the optional webcam shutter is manual, lacking the new automated system of the high-end models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RbkoF"&gt;Lastly, there are the new Latitude 5000 models, which come in 13.3-inch (5320), 14-inch (5420), and 15.6-inch (5520) sizes. The new 5000 series laptops are also getting the new 11th Gen vPro chips, but take things down a step further with less aluminum and more plastic in the design. Dell is using 21 percent bioplastic content (from tree waste) in the lids of the 5000 series laptops, though, in a new environmental move to improve sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUW1gr"&gt;The Latitude 5000 series will be available on January 12th, while the Latitude 7000 series will be available on March 30th, starting at $999. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s new monitors have a dedicated Microsoft Teams button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jtfn_pbRTP7zLaqvhy44efB1vRw=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621594/dellmonitorsmicrosoftteamsbutton.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74tVIj"&gt;Dell is launching three new monitors next month, and all of them come with a dedicated Microsoft Teams button. Dell claims it has created the “world’s first video conferencing monitors certified for Microsoft Teams,” after Microsoft started &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/devices/usb-devices"&gt;certifying displays&lt;/a&gt;, webcams, and headsets last year. Three monitors will be available next month, all offering quick access to Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csGIut"&gt;The button will let Microsoft Teams users quickly launch the app to make and receive video calls. Hands-free commands will also be supported through Cortana and the built-in microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gxav7pMIy-820oyoXogaCUFpbHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214806/EzIgOS6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s new Microsoft Teams monitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b4eYHJ"&gt;This is the first time we’ve seen a Microsoft Teams button on a monitor, but headset manufacturers have been quick to add buttons that support Microsoft’s communications app. New and existing headphones got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242753/microsoft-teams-headphones-button-launch-app-certified-devices-upgrade"&gt;deeper integration with Teams last year&lt;/a&gt;, just as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241972/microsoft-teams-75-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;usage of the app was soaring&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbCnGq"&gt;The Teams button is the main surprise with these displays, but Dell’s trio of videoconferencing monitors also have some useful specs designed for an era where remote work and video calling is key. Each includes a 5-megapixel pop-up infrared camera, which supports facial recognition with Windows Hello. Dell also bundles a noise-canceling microphone and dual 5-watt integrated speakers. There’s even a built-in mode to reduce blue light emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vUnJx"&gt;Dell is launching a 24-inch (FHD) version for $519.99, a 27-inch (QHD) model for $719.99, and a curved 34-inch (WQHD) variant for $1,149.99. All three will launch on February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: tall phone, small price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For $300, it’s right on the money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EO9rwg"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G does something unique: bring 5G to a $299.99 phone without cutting too many corners. That’s a full $200 lower than other budget-oriented competitors like the Google Pixel 4A 5G and Samsung Galaxy A51 5G. Alongside its lower-tier N100 sibling, it’s the first phone in OnePlus’ midrange Nord series to arrive in the US, available from T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and unlocked from OnePlus.com and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5m2r0"&gt;It’s definitely noteworthy that the N10 5G will bring 5G to the under-$300 market. But at least for now, 5G isn’t something most people should care about, much less pay more for. Fortunately, the N10 5G has more going for it. It has a big screen with a high refresh rate, a tall aspect ratio that might make it easier for people with smaller hands to use, and OnePlus’ light-touch take on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziaFwm"&gt;So what sacrifices did OnePlus make to create a $300 phone? The quick version is this: it offers an LCD rather than an OLED screen, uses a less robust processor than midrange and flagship phones, and doesn’t include any water resistance. And you won’t find features that are becoming more common on midrange devices, like wireless charging and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTe6sc"&gt;The question for the N10 5G is whether you’d be happy with a decent all-around device that doesn’t shine in any particular area, or if you should look to one of its budget competitors that goes all in on a feature like battery life or photo quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39E53z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10267045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HhPuLh"&gt;As you’d expect from a $300 phone, the rear of the device is plastic — a glossy, smudge-attracting panel. The phone itself feels appropriately weighty and while it doesn’t scream ‘flagship’ it doesn’t feel too cheap either. I actually kind of like the plastic finish; I feel like it’s a little easier to grip and not as prone to slipping as glass. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back that was quick and reliable in my testing. Overall, it was pretty comfortable to hold and use, despite what its dimensions initially suggested to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ztms"&gt;Somewhat unusually, the N10 5G offers a very tall 20:9 aspect ratio on its screen. It’s a 6.49-inch, 1080 x 2400 LCD, which makes for a device with a generous screen that doesn’t feel too bulky in your hand. Personally I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use. I don’t feel like I’m straining to like an Instagram post when I hold it in one hand. It’s a tight fit in my coat pocket but I could live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PeP8IP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNm4BX"&gt;This screen offers a 90Hz refresh rate that’s faster than the 60Hz typically seen at this price point. This makes for smooth scrolling through apps and makes the phone that bit nicer to use than you might expect for $300. However, the screen does use LCD technology, which lacks the rich contrast of OLED panels you’ll find in many competitors that cost just a little more. It’s good enough in day-to-day use, and it’s viewable in direct sunlight, but it’s not your best option if you watch a lot of dimly lit period dramas on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB1jgY"&gt;The N10 uses a Snapdragon 690 5G processor, one of Qualcomm’s budget 6-series chips, which includes support for the phone’s headline feature: 5G. It’s worth noting that the 690 supports low and mid-band 5G frequencies, but doesn’t offer mmWave connectivity (that’s the super-fast but hard to find variety of 5G). This is also a good time to remind you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;not to buy a new phone just for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. But if you must, be sure to check your carrier’s coverage map before you opt for this or any other 5G phone, and temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3QtPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has said it will update the N10 5G to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IZLjjy"&gt;The N10 5G ships with Android 10, which is one version behind the very latest update. OnePlus has said &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-n100-single-update-android-11"&gt;it will give the N10 and N100 an update&lt;/a&gt; to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates — users will have to settle for two years of security updates. That’s not uncommon at this price point, but it’s an important point to consider. If you plan to pay for it in installments and upgrade within a couple of years anyway, that’s no great loss. If you’d rather get a few solid years out of your device, then the N10 won’t be your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHx7Kb"&gt;OnePlus’ Oxygen OS brings a fairly clean implementation of Android to the N10 5G. You can customize the font and theme, and choose between full gesture control or a navigation bar with fixed controls for home, back and recents. It’s not the pure experience of a Pixel phone, but it doesn’t feel overly cluttered for my taste. I don’t love the OnePlus-themed clock widget on the home screen by default, but it’s mercifully removable, as are the handful of OnePlus-specific apps like Community that I’m not sure I would use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gOsD68"&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3Tdrt7"&gt;You can’t build a $300 phone without making some compromises, and a cheaper processor is one way to do that. The Snapdragon 690 at the heart of the N10 is a newer chip for budget devices, and in my use it turned in decent performance. Occasionally I noticed it stuttering when I scrolled quickly past some very image and video-rich screens, and the camera app sometimes took a few seconds to open. In the camera app itself I saw some slowdowns in the image preview when panning quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6mI1E"&gt;But for the most part I streamed videos, used Google Maps, played games, ordered coffee, and scrolled through Instagram without issue. Speed is definitely one area where OnePlus had to make some concessions, and though performance lagged noticeably at times, I wouldn’t call it a deal-breaker for most people who would consider the N10 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfY-9ttE8I0k8ON-H9HxuxO1r0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214160/ajohnson200104_4354_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The headphone jack lives!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ByqJne"&gt;The N10 5G is configured with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with a MicroSDXC slot for even more space. All three of those specs are more generous than many comparable devices at this price point, and for some may offset the relative pain of the slow processor. Dual speakers provide stereo sound for videos, but audio quality isn’t great. Wired headphones are an option, though, since the N10 5G includes a real, live headphone jack. (OnePlus aficionados should be aware that there’s no ringer switch here, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUCR3A"&gt;The N10 5G isn’t all about battery the way the battery-for-days N100 and Moto G Power are, but its 4,300mAh battery delivers a solid day’s worth of use — and often more than that. I usually got about a day and a half of moderate use out of a full charge. OnePlus includes a 30W fast charger in the box, which is also uncommon at this price point, and it is truly fast: it took the device from 7% to 50% in 20 minutes in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvKZ3-57f7JmZbGR2-SzAORFbS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214161/ajohnson200104_4354_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The N10 5G’s quad camera array&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ksbep7"&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e4FOwl"&gt;You’ll find four cameras (plus a flash) on the N10 5G’s rear camera bump. Here’s a quick rundown of the phone’s cameras:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s2CZqb"&gt;A 64-megapixel main camera with a f/1.79 lens and no optical stabilization (electronic only) that produces 16-megapixel images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JiQ1C5"&gt;An 8-megapixel ultrawide with a f/2.25 lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="53DsHf"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CfUZDR"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 monochrome camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xpRtl1"&gt;A front-facing 16-megapixel f/2.05 selfie camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5YxLvi"&gt;This seems like a lot of cameras, especially since two of them are unlikely to be used frequently. The monochrome camera only kicks in when shooting in black and white, which is accessed by scrolling through the filter options to the very last one. Likewise, the macro camera is activated via the main shooting screen by tapping the flower icon. It’s sort of fun to mess around with, but even in decent lighting image quality is pretty bad. Images from the ultrawide camera are a bit soft if you look closely, but it’s not noticeable enough to ruin an Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1la41a"&gt;The good news is that the main camera is just fine in decent lighting — good, even, considering this is a $300 phone. Colors are on the punchy side without straying into oversaturation, and detail is mostly acceptable in even moderately low light conditions like a well-lit interior. Things get a little noisy and smudgy in low light, but the 64-megapixel sensor (which kicks out 16-megapixel images) does a nice job of hanging on to at least some detail. Nightscape mode does bring back an impressive amount of light in darker situations, but you can’t get away with shooting in near darkness like you can with the Pixel’s Night Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n1xacH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10267032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LsTARh"&gt;I did find that it struggled to find focus at times, and it’s definitely not up to the task of capturing moving subjects in low light, like pets and children. It also lacks a true telephoto camera, and will instead use digital zoom if you switch to the tele setting on the main shooting screen. Resulting images are very soft and have an unpleasant, overprocessed digital look about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnfF8f"&gt;Overall, it’s a camera that doesn’t try to do too much, which is a good thing. If you mostly photograph static scenes and don’t push it too hard, you can expect images that will look just fine on social media. But if you’re looking for any kind of modest zoom or top-notch performance in low light, you’d best look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The included fast charger for the N10" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J9DgFd6y1oMe3nqpSh_CfUwOQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214159/ajohnson200104_4354_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The included fast charger for the N10&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LuXxtR"&gt;Bottom line: this is a very cheap 5G phone with a big screen and decent all-around performance. OnePlus has made some smart sacrifices to get to that $300 price point, and the result is a device with many nice attributes but without a major standout feature. If there’s a particular feature that you prioritize on your phone, like multi-day battery life or an above-average camera, then you can do better around the same price or a little more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f5zlPJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7rOhH"&gt;If you can live without 5G for now (and we think you probably can!) you can get a phone with a little something extra for around the same price. For big battery life you could look to the N100 or Moto G Power. For an above average camera, look at the Google Pixel 4a. That phone is also a good candidate if device longevity or better performance are important to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="u9eprq"&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it. Even if you’re not interested in 5G, which most people probably aren’t, this $300 device still delivers in important ways: a good screen, acceptable performance, a good enough camera, and decent battery life. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>C by GE is getting a new name and going beyond smart lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9DiPDJK8F2WAP5T-00cvPZAOdY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621484/Cync_Indoor_Smart_Camera_Lifestyle_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cync Indoor Camera | Photo: Cync&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOOc3V"&gt;C by GE is starting to see some big changes. The smart lighting brand is getting a new name, &lt;a href="https://www.gelighting.com/smart-home"&gt;Cync&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expanding beyond lighting to become more of a general-purpose smart home brand. The changes follow the sale of GE Lighting to &lt;a href="https://www.savant.com/"&gt;Savant Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a luxury smart home company, &lt;a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-sell-lighting-business-savant-systems-inc"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Duemc"&gt;As Cync, the system is supposed to get a new app in March that’s meant to be more “user-friendly and customizable.” The brand is also launching an outdoor smart plug, a smart switch for ceiling fans, and an indoor security camera — the latter being its first real venture beyond smart plugs, lights, and lighting accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNgd9H"&gt;The Cync Indoor Camera can record footage to the cloud or to an SD card, and the camera has a built-in privacy shutter that can cover up the lens. The outdoor plug launches in March, followed by the camera in May and the fan switch in June. Pricing hasn’t been announced. A thermostat is also in the works for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNGBqu"&gt;C by GE has been around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/29/9634368/c-by-ge-lights-smart-bulb"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt; when the brand launched with lightbulbs that could be controlled from a phone over Bluetooth. They were a simple option for anyone who wanted to try a smart bulb without investing too much, since top competing options required pricey hubs at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJOvtp"&gt;Since then, the product line hasn’t changed dramatically — it now offers products that support Wi-Fi, there are more lighting options, and there are a handful of switches and plugs. The line’s transformation into Cync seems like the first step toward making the brand into something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo to acquire Luigi’s Mansion developer Next Level Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luigi’s Mansion 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBKPsyWVt9RVsBbquN9JodWR8oI=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68620827/Switch_LuigisMansion3_E3_screen_04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1kb9u"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210105.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to acquire Canadian developer Next Level Games, a studio that has worked on some of the company’s major franchises. Next Level is already a second-party partner, meaning it only makes games for Nintendo platforms, but Nintendo says the acquisition will help secure internal development resources and boost collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZVx04"&gt;Next Level is based in Vancouver and is probably best known for developing the second and third &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt; in particular is one of the more technically advanced games available on the Switch, with impressive animation and physics. Other Next Level-developed Nintendo projects include both &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Strikers&lt;/em&gt; titles on the GameCube and the Wii, &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS, and the Wii reboot of &lt;em&gt;Punch-Out!!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t88SQr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luigi’s Mansion 3 is perfectly silly slapstick comedy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ONyfFq"&gt;Financial details of the acquisition haven’t been disclosed, but Nintendo expects it to be a done deal on March 1st. Nintendo will buy out 100 percent of Next Level’s shares and says it should only have a minor effect on its earnings this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces made-in-India Mi 10i</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8OYlyo7lyHNPIIbrQ3INjBkMUm0=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68620790/Eqt5qQdU0AgyxZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgXIzO"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mi 10i, a new phone in its 10 series intended for the Indian market and manufactured in the country — that’s what the “i” stands for, apparently. That said, it’s essentially a rebranded, region-specific version of the Mi 10T Lite 5G, which is itself basically the same thing as the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A19cai"&gt;The phone has a 6.67-inch 120Hz 20:9 1080p LCD, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor with an onboard X52 5G modem, and up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is 4,820mAh, and Xiaomi says it should charge from empty to full in 58 minutes at 33W. There’s also a headphone jack, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and an IR blaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8vH9ucU3zrcqzwD0KlHXgoC2jHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214665/Eq8lDsjUcAE7u7o.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kxhjXa"&gt;The main camera uses Samsung’s 108-megapixel ISOCELL HM2 sensor, supported by an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera and 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. The selfie camera is 16 megapixels and located in what Xiaomi says is the smallest hole-punch cutout in its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RER9aW"&gt;The Mi 10i will go on sale on January 7th in India priced at Rs. 20,999 (~$290) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Rs. 21,999 ($300) model doubles the storage to 128GB, and there’s another 8GB/128GB variant at Rs. 23,999 ($330). At that pricing, it could be a strong competitor to the likes of the OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Pixel 5’s system sounds are annoyingly loud, a new update may fix that problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The bottom speaker sounds much better than the panel audio speaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMHktbyx08GVw7s00Hkj9T3fFL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619813/akrales_201012_4137_0151.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGuqaN"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505"&gt;January Pixel updates&lt;/a&gt;, Google might have fixed an issue that meant Pixel 5 system sounds could be a lot louder than you might have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hm2Gb1"&gt;Since the Pixel 5’s launch in October, numerous users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jm8yzm/lowest_volume_on_pixel_5_notifications_is_very/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jnpwhd/pixel_5_users_volume_issue_on_some_systemapp/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and on Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77479730?hl=en"&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/80874883?hl=en"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/79219514?hl=en#"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; have reported that Pixel 5 system sounds (like the camera shutter or the sound you hear when you take a screenshot) could be quite loud, even when the phone’s volume was set to a lower level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzejQO"&gt;In the release notes for the January Pixel updates, however, Google says that the Pixel 5-specific update includes “further tuning &amp;amp; improvements for volume level of system sounds.” A few users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/kqg3q3/january_update_finally_fixes_the_most_annoying/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; have reported that the system sounds are much quieter after installing the update, though some say that the sounds are &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; quiet now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zG8nI"&gt;The release notes also list other changes, including improvements to auto-brightness on the Pixel 4A, 4A 5G, and 5. Here’s Google’s full list of “notable fixes” in the January updates:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFpdfR_tgQW-vidQsK3Q_G5EsZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214032/thread_91975505_11215868825490307245.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zj4vUP"&gt;Google says the updates are rolling out now to all supported Pixel devices running Android 11. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple temporarily closes all remaining Apple Stores in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store SoHo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWgBhl-RROkaqKXorEibrfKtJwA=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619506/apple-store-soho-nyc-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTS3xs"&gt;Apple has been shutting down loads of retail stores as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to peak — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22190895/apple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic"&gt;on December 20th,&lt;/a&gt; it temporarily closed every single location in California, Mexico, Brazil, and over a dozen in London. Now, as England and Scotland go into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/lockdown-no-3-what-are-the-new-restrictions"&gt;a pair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55531069"&gt;new national lockdowns&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is closing all of its remaining stores in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bw5Yx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/apple-stores-uk-close-again/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;’s Michael Steeber reports&lt;/a&gt;, that means 18 additional stores are now closed across the UK, including several in Scotland and one in Belfast, Ireland — though it looks like the Belfast store may have already been closed. (&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54117810"&gt;Northern Ireland went into lockdown even earlier&lt;/a&gt;, on December 26th, shutting down all non-essential shops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VMSjSW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All 18 UK Apple Stores open today will close from January 5. Includes every location in Scotland. Most of the other 20 stores closed just before the holidays. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RYfhWgNkrb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RYfhWgNkrb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Steeber (@MichaelSteeber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelSteeber/status/1346205814848151553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKKPpW"&gt;While it feels worthwhile to note the closures, they may not make all that much of a difference for most shoppers, who already couldn’t physically enter many of these stores since November. That’s when Apple&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/04/apple-stores-england-lockdown-open-click-and-collect/"&gt; started offering express service only&lt;/a&gt; at many of these stores. You’d have been able to pick up online orders, but you couldn’t browse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teledyne is buying FLIR to create a super-sized sensor shop with thermal and laser vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4GWfyae328dV0C-5owXnSL6VEA=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619175/flir_teledyne.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Industrial sensor giant Teledyne will acquire FLIR, an Oregon-based company that makes thermal-imaging and night vision technology, the &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is worth $8 billion in a mix of cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuDXhu"&gt;“At the core of both our companies is proprietary sensor technologies. Our business models are also similar: we each provide sensors, cameras and sensor systems to our customers,” Teledyne chairman Robert Mehrabian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The companies’ sensors are “uniquely complementary, with minimal overlap,” he added, which could be important when regulators decide whether to approve the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZtl4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You probably already know FLIR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cslfoO"&gt;Oregon-based FLIR makes thermal-imaging and night-vision technology for the military and for industrial and consumer applications — if you’ve ever seen infrared footage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/6/15743628/flir-one-thermal-camera-iphone-android-specs"&gt;there’s a good chance it was captured&lt;/a&gt; with a FLIR camera. FLIR also has some &lt;a href="https://www.suasnews.com/2020/05/flir-wins-20-6-million-contract-to-provide-black-hornet-nano-uav-systems-for-u-s-armys-soldier-borne-sensor-program/"&gt;$60 million in contracts with the Army&lt;/a&gt; for its Black Hornet drone, and its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fdiscover%2Fcores-components%2Fflir-hadron-enables-lightweight-and-affordable-suas%2F%3Futm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DSkimlinks%26cjevent%3D6abd03b34eda11eb837e00300a24060f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hadron thermal camera&lt;/a&gt; is used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;other Army-approved drones&lt;/a&gt;. FLIR also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fnews-center%2Fcamera-cores--components%2Fflir-to-provide-thermal-imaging-cameras-for-zoox-robotaxi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;supplies thermal imaging&lt;/a&gt; cameras for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;Zoox’s self-driving robotaxi&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the vehicles better “see” people and driving conditions, particularly important in urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kM2HC0"&gt;Teledyne might also have tech that’s handy for self-driving vehicles: in addition to making thermal sensors for defense and industrial clients, including NASA, it’s one of the companies that builds the LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors you might see atop a self-driving car. Its LIDAR was also used in NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission last October, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540873/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-sample-bennu-storage-success"&gt;map the surface of the Bennu asteroid&lt;/a&gt; so it could collect samples to bring back to Earth. Teledyne isn’t to be confused with Velodyne, whose LIDAR featured in some of the earliest self-driving prototypes and in Google’s early cars, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Owcr2"&gt;The acquisition is expected to close sometime in the middle of the year, the companies said, pending regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
