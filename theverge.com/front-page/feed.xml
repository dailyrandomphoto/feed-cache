    <title>Snapchat’s built-in map will start recommending places for you to visit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wdcr_NMOovSiuxYNPLs83D_WFeI=/0x11:1552x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644268/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_6.19.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RnDEB8"&gt;More than 250 million people use Snapchat’s built-in map to see where their friends are in the world. The map interface was recently upgraded to a main tab inside the app, and today, Snap is adding a new feature that’ll surface popular places it thinks you may want to visit. Snap Map users will also start seeing lists of places, such as bars or restaurants, they’ve either tagged in past posts or favorited to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBIntn"&gt;The “Popular” tab at the bottom center of the Snap Map will show recommendations for places to go based on factors like your current location, friend activity on the map, and the kind of places you’ve saved as favorites. “This new algorithm in our Popular Tab sets Snap Map apart as a highly personalized discovery platform, and is a first-of-its-kind feature for Snapchat, overall,” a Snap spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0BNtx"&gt;With these additions and other recent updates, such as integrations with the restaurant review website The Infatuation and Ticketmaster, Snapchat is turning its map into a unique way to discover the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCecZs"&gt;And while it’s not a meaningful driver of revenue for Snap yet, advertisers are able to target ads based on the locations of people who have opted into sharing that information — a potentially good way to encourage foot traffic to a local business. Seeing friends on a map alongside info about businesses is also a relatively unique feature that Facebook hasn’t managed to copy. Snap recently reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589236/snapchat-users-293-million-q2-2021"&gt;that is has 293 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;, making its user base about 42 percent larger than Twitter’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s back-to-school gift guide 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts for high schoolers and the college bound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iYqwJ1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School is back in session&lt;/strong&gt; — well, almost. After a turbulent year and a half, many high school and college campuses are looking to return to in-person classes in the fall as vaccination rates continue to climb and the US enters a new phase of the pandemic. Some students will continue to study remotely. Some will opt for a hybrid approach. But all will need supplies to carry out their coursework and make the most of their precious time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fR5Sp"&gt;If you’re not sure about what to get the student in your life, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff has corralled a list of items that are sure to please high school students, college kids, and post-grads alike. Some, like Logitech’s C920S webcam ($65) and the 2020 MacBook Air ($900), are practical favorites, while others, like &lt;em&gt;Salt Fat Acid Heat&lt;/em&gt; ($17), are meant to appease the student in all of us, whether you’re involved in academics or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2BDkl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you’re looking for a wider selection of laptop picks, we also have guides to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best laptops for students&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony has sold 10 million PS5 consoles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmixewYt34O3mW85ggy7P36Ahhc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644060/vpavic_4278_20201030_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i4m06q"&gt;Sony has now sold more than 10 million PS5 consoles. That’s up more than 2 million sales from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407195/sony-ps5-sales-numbers-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;7.8 million Sony previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; in April, and it means the PS5 continues to outpace sales of the PS4, making it the fastest-selling console in Sony’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzttgu"&gt;The PS5 may be selling well, but supply is constrained and it’s still difficult to purchase a console right now thanks to a global chip shortage. “While PS5 has reached more households faster than any of our previous consoles, we still have a lot of work ahead of us as demand for PS5 continues to outstrip supply,” says Jim Ryan, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “I want gamers to know that while we continue to face unique challenges throughout the world that affect our industry and many others, improving inventory levels remains a top priority for SIE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2V4hi"&gt;Sony has also shared some milestones around PS5 launch titles today. &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales &lt;/em&gt;has sold more than 6.5 million copies since its launch in November, with &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; selling more than 1.1 million copies since its launch last month. &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;has also sold more than 560,000 copies since its April launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxSXwo"&gt;While Sony continues to share console hardware figures, Microsoft stopped sharing Xbox sales numbers in the Xbox One era. “We’re all in on games,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;during the company’s earnings call yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. “The Xbox Series S and X are our fastest selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold life-to-date than any previous generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKB0e6"&gt;Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at Niko Partners, shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1420141968546537472"&gt;estimates on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the Xbox Series X / S “total sell in was 6.5m as of June 30, 2021.” That’s up from previous estimates of 5.7 million for Xbox One, and 5 million for Xbox 360 in the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngXnJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 28th 9:35AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Xbox Series X / S sales estimates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Atmos-ready Sonos Arc sees a rare discount at Wellbots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the front of the Sonos Arc soundbar with a TV in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-NSo6TZiVETkANumXJ7o_adOW4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644005/DSCF0849.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In a rare move, Wellbots is offering the standout Sonos Arc for $50 off MSRP. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0EgzLH"&gt;Sonos products are an easy sell, at least when the price is right. Like most products in the Sonos lineup, the Sonos Arc features a clean design and excellent sound quality, the latter of which is evident while listening to everything from Dolby Atmos movies to the lush sounds of The National’s most recent album, &lt;em&gt;I Am Easy to Find&lt;/em&gt;. What’s more, the all-in-one soundbar includes built-in support for Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2. Granted, you’ll need a recent TV that supports Atmos over HDMI ARC to truly unlock the Arc’s potential, but if you have one, it’s a great way to future-proof your home theater setup. Normally $800 and rarely discounted, the white iteration of the Sonos Arc is &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fsonos%2Darc%2Dsoundbar&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal072821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Wellbots for $50 off&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;DADMUSIC&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tjeBxF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10672350"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iZjzDR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sonos CEO discusses the Arc and customer backlash over leaving old products behind","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249926/vergecast-podcast-interview-sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-s2-arc-atmo-soundbar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="e6LtcW"&gt;As far as tablets go, Apple’s iPad lineup doesn’t really have much in the way of competition. Yes, there are competent Android tablets like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Tab A7&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon makes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;Fire HD 10&lt;/a&gt; and a wealth of other entry-level slates, but none of them feel particularly premium. Apple’s iPad Air does, however, and it’s not just because of the bevy of attractive colors. The fourth-gen model supports USB-C and the Apple Pencil 2. It also comes with a terrific 1080p display and a quick A14 Bionic processor, which should be more than enough power for most users. It’s not going to outperform, say, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it also doesn’t need to. Right now, the 64GB, 2020 iPad Air is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746838897268969922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $500, matching its all-time low. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D5SsBB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTNOUl"&gt;If you’re looking to stock up on a few items before the school year, eBay is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2F_electronics%2Fcertified-refurbished-back-to-school&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22596188%2Fsonos-arc-soundbar-2020-ipad-air-acer-27-inch-gaming-monitor-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently having a sale&lt;/a&gt; on all things refurbished. For a limited time, you can save on headphones, laptops, and a host of notable tech, including Acer’s impressive Nitro XV272U. The 27-inch, QHD gaming monitor — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/2/16/22286158/acers-nitro-xv272u-gaming-monitor-g-sync-1440p-qhd-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we’ve highlighted before&lt;/a&gt; — features an IPS display and 1440p resolution, along with a 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync support, a technology that steadies gameplay and helps prevent tearing. It also comes with a 1ms response time and a range of ports, including four USB Type-A 3.0 ports, two HDMI ports, and a DisplayPort.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Young people can make real money selling vintage clothes online — if they can stay on the right side of the algorithm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="xh0xLK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i9LNe2"&gt;Seventeen-year-old Chelsea Aves of Fremont, California, has had a Depop account since her sophomore year of high school. But when COVID shut down the world, she got serious about selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lcuCP"&gt;“We were all quarantined, and I had nothing to do, so I was on my Marie Kondo decluttering binge,” Aves says. “My whole closet had to go. And that’s where I first started getting my inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPpY29"&gt;When she’d made her way through her own unwanted clothes, photographing and uploading the good stuff to the secondhand / vintage e-commerce app, she fixed her sights on other full closets in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bwhHOD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My whole closet had to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cse24s"&gt;“I started ‘decluttering’ my parents’ closet,” she says. “I was like, ‘Whoa, these are good!’ They had like a lot of ’90s brands, like Ed Hardy — a lot of things that were going in style again. They weren’t too happy when they found out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z4Syk"&gt;With her parents’ eventual forgiveness, Aves took her sourcing up a notch, trawling for finds at flea markets and garage sales. About a year and a half into her Depop experiment, she has more than &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/chelseaaves/"&gt;850 items listed&lt;/a&gt;, and she’s sold more than twice that. By her estimate, she brings in between $500 and $1,500 a week — enough to pay for her classes and books at the community college where she’s studying nursing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tihBn1"&gt;The money is great, but she says it’s the freedom that she finds so appealing. “I remember when I went and bought my first big purchase without [my parents] knowing. They were like, ‘Where did you get this iPad? From your clothes?’” she says. “Any sort of independence that you have from your parents is, like, everything.” Along the way, Aves has developed a new arsenal of professional skills: inventory management, customer relations, and the feat of international shipping, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uhWfU5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many of our highest-earning sellers started their shops during the pandemic.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xA5q3X"&gt;Mary Findley, a Depop senior community-development manager, says Aves’ story is an increasingly common one: For four years, there has been press around young sellers &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-haroutounian-depop-vintage-dealer-college"&gt;paying their college tuition&lt;/a&gt; with Depop earnings, but 2020 marked the dawn of a new age for the ecommerce-meets-social app: &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90512591/meet-the-24-year-old-designer-who-made-1-million-on-depop"&gt;millionaire&lt;/a&gt; seller success stories, sales surges, and last month a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464572/etsy-targets-gen-z-shoppers-with-1-6-billion-depop-acquisition"&gt;$1.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; acquisition by Etsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnzKCN"&gt;As of spring 2020, Findley says, these upward trends are in overdrive. At the start of the lockdowns, the team at Depop — founded in Italy in 2011, now headquartered in London — began to see activity spike among its 26 million buyers and sellers, &lt;a href="https://news.depop.com/who-we-are/facts-and-figures/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of whom are 25 or younger, according to company data. “Many of our highest-earning sellers started their shops during the pandemic,” Findley says, “and they’ve built successful businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pthLNx"&gt;Rio Andras Ramirez, a 24-year-old artist in Janesville, Wisconsin, isn’t a high earner yet, but they’re making moves. Ramirez also started selling in the thick of COVID, and this spring, they left their job as an Amazon warehouse associate and signed up for a much more flexible arrangement with Instacart, to make more space for Depop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TUA7"&gt;Now, Ramirez is putting in 20-plus hours per week, sourcing size- and gender-inclusive goods from their own wardrobe and from their grandma Rosa (e.g., vintage Betty Boop attire), arranging their listings in a &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/rioandras/"&gt;dreamy color spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. Ramirez’s goal is to get to a point where Depop can sustain them full-time and be a venue to sell their own designs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dspdof"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grinding on Depop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="89lipH"&gt;Jordan Cox, 22, balances &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/jordiend/"&gt;her burgeoning Depop shop&lt;/a&gt; with lab work as a graduate student of inorganic chemistry at Columbia. She’s curating a collection that speaks to Gen Z microtrends, like big, boxy “grandpa sweaters,” “dark academia,” and, generally, “‘Cool girl’ Pinterest vibes,” which she’s selling at a pace of about 40 items a month. Her $200 to $400 a month in profit isn’t life-changing, she says, and the listing part is “kind of tedious,” but she won’t be folding up shop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgM3CN"&gt;“I do like that it’s very ‘social media’ feeling,” she says. “I get notifications on my phone, and there definitely is an amount of adrenaline or dopamine or whatever when you get a sale, versus someone just liking your posts on Instagram, so I think that also keeps me hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpKtoh"&gt;But since joining in May 2020, she’s had Depop’s physical and logistical challenges to navigate, and these can be especially tricky for young people in small living spaces who are often on the move. For starters, there’s the storage dilemma: “How do you be a serious Depop seller while attending college and living in a dorm?” one seller &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Depop/comments/j1rdev/being_a_depop_seller_in_college/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; to /r/Depop. “Right now, my college is closed because of COVID, so I’m doing this from home … Are there people who do this out of their dorm? Is it even possible?” Commenters weighed in: “Live off-campus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqT9ac"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As of early July, the couple had sold 39 items for around $500&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laKdHK"&gt;Then there’s managing fulfillment as a one-person show. Over Black Friday, Cox made something like $1,000 in sales — but the annual Depop frenzy also coincides with Thanksgiving, when she was out of town for a week and a half. To avoid delayed shipping, she hauled dozens of bins of hundreds of items around in her car for the duration of her break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD1IGt"&gt;Cody Williams, 25, of Phoenix, Arizona, said he and his fiancé, Kylee, were “looking for ways to make additional passive income” this year, and Depop seemed like the ticket. In the past month, they’ve launched “&lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/thriftmydriftaz"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/rosewearhouse/"&gt;hers&lt;/a&gt;” channels, featuring inventory sourced mostly from their own closets. Williams’ photos often feature him, cropped at the waist, looking down at the garment he’s wearing in nonchalant admiration. As of early July, the couple had sold 39 items for around $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sP5wEb"&gt;Based on the numbers (as tracked and analyzed in the app’s dashboard), earning five or six grand by year end seems “super realistic, and shooting low to a certain extent,” Williams says, so he feels like they’re on the right track. There’s just one problem: “At this point the big deficit is: How can we identify ways to market our products without having to be, like, locked into the phone all day? [Depop is like] we’re gonna give you some sort of incentive, like you can get money from this — but you need to stare at your phone for eight hours a day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="DnPGDG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Algorithm Blues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="PLIAKI"&gt;The pandemic hasn’t meant a windfall for everyone on the platform. About three years ago, 23-year-old photographer Malena Lloyd moved from Cleveland to Norwalk, Ohio, where a dead-end job search led her to become her own boss on Depop. Dealing secondhand and vintage, she says she’s making more than she would as a barista or shop clerk, and feeling creatively fulfilled in the meantime, enlisting friends to model her items, and developing a standout aesthetic for &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/muhlenuh/"&gt;her brand&lt;/a&gt;, with colorful backdrops of magenta, tangerine, and retro crocheted rainbow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OyYgPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been pretty slow.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HNbW7r"&gt;But when the pandemic hit, Lloyd’s sales tanked, and they haven’t entirely bounced back. Lloyd says other sellers have noticed it, too. “It’s been pretty slow. Like, in all of my years of selling, this past year and even a little bit of this year, it’s been bad,” she says. “It’s especially hard because it’s not like you work two weeks and then you’re going to get a paycheck. A few years ago it was so much better — that’s when it was amazing for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIGbK5"&gt;Lloyd has begun to put her eggs in other baskets: a side gig at a thrift store she landed because of her Depop work, seamstress and design work she’s just getting into, and prepping for an upcoming move to NYC to pursue fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jg9MBR"&gt;Whether she was up against algorithm changes, or some more human factor, she is learning one of the platform’s hardest lessons: success on Depop can be fickle. The most successful sellers are those with the power to take their audiences with them, often building up an audience before leaving for &lt;a href="https://igirlworld.com/collections/shop-all-1"&gt;their own online stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBfviB"&gt;But if the churn is hurting Depop, it’s hard to see it in the numbers. The company saw a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90512591/meet-the-24-year-old-designer-who-made-1-million-on-depop"&gt;30 percent uptick&lt;/a&gt; in items sold early last year, and ultimately doubled its revenue (mostly from sales commissions) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464572/etsy-targets-gen-z-shoppers-with-1-6-billion-depop-acquisition"&gt;$70 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It also appears to have gained millions of users, reporting some 5 million more than they did in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-successful-business-resale-app-depop-sellers"&gt;June of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. If buyers have more options — for example, new stock like Aves’ parents’ freshly liquidated wardrobe of in-demand &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/06/i-just-want-to-dress-like-kim-possible-this-summer.html"&gt;Y2K&lt;/a&gt; fashion — Lloyd and other veteran sellers just have to hustle that much harder to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mSBNCa"&gt;For her part, Lloyd plans to roll with it, repeating a classic freelancer’s mantra: “Just keep doing it, keep listing, keep selling, try your best, and hopefully it will shake out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZGNiV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpEUVf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpUnnf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBPhUm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Could you beat this bipedal robot’s 5K run time?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGbWGGx1yQUIQj5rId6MmlkWKnE=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643610/cassie_5k.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RNvAE"&gt;Researchers from Oregon State University have coaxed a bipedal robot off the couch to successfully complete the &lt;a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k"&gt;first ever robotic 5 kilometer outdoors run&lt;/a&gt;. The bot, Cassie, completed the route in 53 minutes, untethered and on a single battery charge. So next time you’re out for a jog, remember: that’s the time to beat if you want out-pace the killer robots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUomg3"&gt;(For now.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHMo9Q"&gt;Cassie is the creation of OSU spin-off Agility Robotics, which has been pushing the commercial case for bipedal robots for a while. Cassie itself was the company’s first product, manufactured between 2017 and 2019, and now embraced by research labs. Agility now makes an updated bipedal bot, Digit, which has arms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050322/bipedal-robot-digit-agility-robotics-on-sale-delivery-inspection-ces-2020"&gt;handle packages&lt;/a&gt; and has been used by Ford as part of a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/meet-digit-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-solution-418d9995bb97"&gt;research project into autonomous delivery robots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlGYGG"&gt;Bipedal machines are a tricky sell, though. Their big advantage is they can easily navigate spaces made for humans, like stairs and tight corridors. But their bipedalism means they’re inherently less stable, especially compared to quadrupedal robots like those made by Boston Dynamics. It’s just harder to knock something over when it’s standing on four legs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSS_1FevUUuOeJqDIeDC_7NaHNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745258/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.53.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k" target="_blank"&gt;OSU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cassie the robot was controlled and chaperoned on its 5K run. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kO1Jr5"&gt;The team behind Cassie say this might change as new deep learning techniques allow bipedal robots to develop new ways to stabilize themselves during locomotion. These methods aren’t flawless, though. Cassie fell twice during its 5K run, for example — once because its computer brain overheated, and the other because its human controller directed it to take a corner too quickly. (Yes, Cassie did not run under its own directions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjzGUM"&gt;OSU robotics professor and Agility Robotics co-founder Jonathan Hurst is still confident bipedal bots will become the norm, blending in with humans. “In the not very distant future, everyone will see and interact with robots in many places in their everyday lives, robots that work alongside us and improve our quality of life,” said Hurst in an OSU &lt;a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rud4KV"&gt;Who knows, maybe you’ll even see them out on your morning run. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poco’s latest high-performance phone is the $299 X3 GT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GYcao46lxLmIxrh9ooVfJ3lWrNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643530/DSCF7729_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT looks very similar to the Chinese version of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8COsr8"&gt;Xiaomi spin-off Poco has announced yet another X3 phone. The X3 GT follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344126/poco-f3-x3-pro-snapdragon-860-870-announced-specs"&gt;X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;X3 NFC&lt;/a&gt;, this time focusing on performance with a fast 120Hz screen and a new MediaTek processor. It’s mostly a rebranded version of &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_10_pro_(china)-10930.php"&gt;Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which was released last month in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHyhTy"&gt;MediaTek is often associated with lower-end devices, but its Dimensity processors for 2021 feature configurations of Arm cores that aren’t too far off what you’d find in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. The 6nm Dimensity 1100 in the Poco X3 GT has four A78 cores at 2.6GHz and four lower-power A55 cores at 2GHz — compare that to the Snapdragon 888’s single 2.84GHz X1, three 2.42GHz A78s, and four 1.8GHz A55s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJAMcv"&gt;We found the similar Dimensity 1200 to be a capable performer in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;review of the new OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference between that chip and the 1100 is that one of its A78 cores is clocked to 3GHz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1p8YLZUojD4vfrhtudsB997qdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745168/DSCF7732_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT runs Xiaomi’s MIUI.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXr2S"&gt;The X3 GT is the fastest charging Poco phone to date, with a 5,000mAh battery that fills up at 67W at a claimed 0-100 percent for a full charge. The primary camera has a 64-megapixel sensor, and there’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPVZVm"&gt;Other standout features include a proper linear motor for flagship-level haptic feedback, as well as a 6.6-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD display. Since the screen is an LCD, the fingerprint sensor is located on the sleep/wake button on the side, as opposed to under the display as is common with OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqBQD"&gt;Poco hasn’t provided full release details just yet, but the X3 GT’s starting MSRP is listed at $299, which of course is likely to differ across various markets. It’ll be released first in regions including southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, and will come with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PkzZGDDed11lv9m_-iJR-bX2BNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745169/DSCF7731_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The X3 GT has a 64-megapixel primary camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp reportedly developing iOS to Android transfer option for chat history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iy6Yt808NRLeJ9SaWuUheTTq95w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643512/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbQWNL"&gt;WhatsApp is developing a way for its users to transfer their chat histories from iOS to Android, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1420313526757957636"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/26/whatsapp-chat-android-ios-data-transfer-tool/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature could fix one of the biggest annoyances with the Facebook-owned messaging service, which is that it’s not officially possible to transfer a backup of your messages between iPhone and Android, only between phones running the same operating system. Details of the in-development feature have been appearing in WhatsApp’s software &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-allow-chat-history-migration-between-ios-and-android/"&gt;since at least April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XAEJC"&gt;Screenshots shared by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; show a new “Move chats to Android” option in WhatsApp’s iOS app. A second screenshot shows a screen prompting users to keep their iPhone unlocked with WhatsApp open while the transfer is taking place. So far, most of the evidence has pointed towards an iOS to Android transfer feature, but &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-support-chat-history-migration-to-a-different-phone-number/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the opposite will also be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jVeFq3"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xdadevelopers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@xdadevelopers&lt;/a&gt; for your recent discovery about the "Switch to Android" app, to migrate WhatsApp chat history from iOS to Android.  &lt;br&gt;These screenshots show how the process works. This feature is under development and it will be available in a future update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FmZbXi33L2"&gt;https://t.co/FmZbXi33L2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/w7GiCUHSuS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/w7GiCUHSuS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1420313526757957636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0SW91f"&gt;WhatsApp’s new transfer tool could form part of a new “Switch to Android” iOS app under development from Google, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-preparing-switch-to-android-ios-app/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the “Move to iOS” app that Apple offers to help users migrate from Android to iOS, Switch to Android could make it easier to migrate to Google’s operating system. Code in Google’s app suggests it might integrate with WhatsApp’s unreleased transfer tool, according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFwWEp"&gt;News of the migration feature comes as WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577594/whatsapp-multi-device-e2e-facebook"&gt;beta testing multi-device support&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to access their conversations from multiple devices, without needing to route everything through a single phone. As well as transferring chat histories between platforms, &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-support-chat-history-migration-to-a-different-phone-number/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has also reported&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp is developing a way of transferring them between different phone numbers. It’s currently unclear when any of these features might be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s newest under-display selfie camera looks slightly improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nM2raYUHV0eGZkqzuYfIyf_5K6A=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643337/axon_zte_30.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ZTE’s Axon 30.  | Image: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDdvfn"&gt;Last year’s Axon 20 5G from ZTE was the world’s first commercially-available phone to put a front-facing camera underneath its display. It was an impressive step forward for phone technology but there was one big problem: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;the camera sucked&lt;/a&gt;. It took lousy pictures and the module distorted the display in certain settings. Now, ZTE is trying again with &lt;a href="https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/news/20210727e1.html"&gt;the updated Axon 30&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to offer some improvements over its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SLBp"&gt;First, a little spec dump. The Axon 30 has a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution, all powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 5G chipset. There’s a four-camera array on the rear of the device, with a 64-megapixel main, 8-megapixel 120-degree wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro lens, and an additional depth-of-field lens. The battery has a 4200mAh capacity and 55W fast charging, and, as per &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_axon_30_5g_brings_a_secondgen_ud_camera_snapdragon_870_and_55w_charging-news-50255.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have the options of 6GB / 8GB / 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gddVE9"&gt;But the most interesting updates for the Axon 30 are to the under-display camera. For these under-display modules to work, you have to use transparent materials in that area of the screen, which are a fairly recent development and so lower-quality compared to regular display tech. For the Axon 30, ZTE says it’s doubled the pixel density in this area from 200 PPI to 400 PPI, which should make for a more seamless integration with the display. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_K7PyqiX_ag4Emg6XyhYg34RMIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745212/gsmarena_011.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the Axon 20 (left) and Axon 30 (right) under-display screens. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKuy1r"&gt;ZTE says it’s also improved the under-display camera itself. You can see in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our hands-on with the Axon 20&lt;/a&gt; last year that pictures from this camera were hazy and soft in good lighting, and introduced a ton of noise in bad lightning. The camera was a great technical achievement, sure, but not on par with regular front-facing lenses. Based on the shot below, though, from popular phone informant Ice Universe (aka @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/universeice"&gt;UniverseIce&lt;/a&gt;), there may be some improvements with the Axon 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0iOsD4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a selfie with plenty of light outdoors. &lt;a href="https://t.co/24xEir7E8r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/24xEir7E8r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419993869911924740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLjn"&gt;We’ll obviously have to wait to try the phone ourselves to give you a full evaluation, but don’t hold your breath for any miracles. As Ice Universe notes, the picture above was taken outdoors with plenty of light, an in response to a Twitter user suggesting they need to try out the camera in worse conditions, Ice Universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419996698449911810"&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt;: “Such a poor performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iCdyZ"&gt;Another photo from Ice suggests the under-display camera is also visible when the screen is turned off, but that’s hardly a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTIfQK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZteAxon30?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZteAxon30&lt;/a&gt;  But the camera is not completely invisible. When the screen is off, you can see it, just like we can see the fingerprint sensor under the sun. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sNNvReVf3p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sNNvReVf3p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1420001203321139209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4FCjt"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 is launching in China first, with &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reporting that sales will begin on August 3rd. Price start at CNY 2,198 ($338) for the 6GB / 128GB model and CNY 3,098 ($476) for the 12GB / 256GB version. Global availability and pricing will be coming later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Krispy Kreme is selling Xbox doughnuts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvpBkiyHTcawgLgX8s6W5VlfSIo=/0x0:5940x3960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643295/xboxdoughnut.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispy Kreme’s new Xbox doughnut.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Krispy Kreme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iie5Bl"&gt;Krispy Kreme has created an Xbox doughnut. The fluffy doughnut is a marketing collaboration with Microsoft to celebrate 20 years of Xbox, and will be sold at Krispy Kreme stores, cabinets, and online across the UK and Ireland between August 2nd and August 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lilyX6"&gt;The doughnuts won’t come equipped with CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs, but you might be able to win that type of hardware in the form of an Xbox Series S. As part of this marketing campaign, Krispy Kreme is also giving away Microsoft’s latest mini Xbox. You’ll need to purchase a dozen of the new Xbox doughnuts for a chance to win a console, and Krispy Kreme will include a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with every dozen doughnuts bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CVfx6T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the next generation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing... The Nexus Level Doughnut&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Soon  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UVteHkCnjT"&gt;https://t.co/UVteHkCnjT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@xboxuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KrispyKremeXbox?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KrispyKremeXbox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xf3hRuKybw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xf3hRuKybw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Krispy Kreme UK (@krispykremeUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/krispykremeUK/status/1420289168920485890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwxybh"&gt;The doughnut itself is &lt;a href="https://www.krispykreme.co.uk/the-nexus-level.html"&gt;called the Nexus Level&lt;/a&gt;, and is dipped in icing and decorated with the Xbox Nexus design. A single doughnut will be priced at £2.10 (nearly $3), or a dozen will be available for £14.45 (about $20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SCIHE"&gt;Krispy Kreme has even created a playful marketing video, featuring a creative director named “Kristina Kareem” and a quality assurance guru named “Xavier Boxell.” I doughnut believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
