    <title>The solar roof could finally become a reality thanks to GAF Energy’s nailable solar shingles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxQ1krh-938K9k8ns6ih3PR3AY0=/0x6:1152x774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343840/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210310_1904_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDyosX"&gt;In 2016, Tesla tried to reinvent the humble roof as a beautiful array of glass tiles brimming with solar energy — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410075/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-customer-reactions"&gt;a vision it’s been struggling to deliver ever since&lt;/a&gt;. But San Jose, California-based GAF Energy thinks it has a simpler solution to the solar roof. It’s built a solar shingle, one that can be nailed down in packs much like the everyday shingles you’d use when repairing or replacing your normal, non-solar roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="axChQT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Solar panel, meet nail gun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DN9RWV"&gt;You might have heard of solar shingles before, but GAF Energy president Martin DeBono suggests the new Timberline Solar shingles are the first to actually deserve that name because they’re the first to actually work that way — you literally drive nails through a three-inch nailing strip, overlap the top of that shingle with the bottom of the next one, and repeat. “A number of companies have come out with what &lt;em&gt;they &lt;/em&gt;call solar shingles, but they’re pretty much identical to regular solar panels, just small,” explains DeBono, saying how those previous solar roofs also required rails so the panels could be screwed down. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ldr5q46fMOrC2W1Kz6sOY-K33ic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142983/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210308_0663_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FeqReN"&gt;The result of true shingles, DeBono claims, is that it takes days instead of weeks to install a solar roof. “We’ve installed them already in two days, including ripping off the old roof and putting on the new roof,” he says. The company already tried traditional tile-based solar roofs, &lt;a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/gaf-energy-has-installed-more-solar-roofs-than-tesla"&gt;pointing me to a previous interview&lt;/a&gt; where DeBono said GAF Energy had installed over 2,000 of them, allegedly more than Tesla. “It takes multiple days, 10 to 12 people on the roof,” DeBono relates. But its parent company, building materials conglomerate Standard Industries, decided to invest over $1 billion in this seemingly simpler shingle solution instead. (&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/19/meet-the-billionaire-family-building-americas-roofs-and-taking-on-elon-musk/?sh=433763226eac"&gt;Here’s a&lt;em&gt; Forbes&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt; of Standard Industries’ founders and their solar play.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Lufu"&gt;DeBono says the Timberline Solar are the first products to ever receive UL’s 7103 certification to serve as both solar panels &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; construction materials, thanks to a special sandwich of glass, polysilicon solar cells, and top layer of a proprietary fluorinated alkane ethylene polymer that’s fire-resistant, impact-resistant, textured to be walkable, and still transparent enough to let the light through. He says they give the panels a Class A fire rating, stand up to hail, and yet the shingles are actually less dense at the same thickness as a normal shingle, meaning they weigh slightly less and should be just as easy for roofers to sling around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65_DJ3P1QNCZvoJfW8S1o0SfW6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143071/Timberline_Solar_PK_ALP_210310_1925_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kPVXeE"&gt;And while it takes a lot more solar shingles than solar panels to form a roof — an average-sized 6kW array might take up 130 of them — DeBono says it shouldn’t be less efficient or more costly just because there are more modules. For one thing, DeBono says the Thai cells his company is using are 22.6 percent efficient, within a few percent of the state-of-the-art in solar panels, and the greater number of shingles means the system’s total power doesn’t degrade as much when some of them get shaded as the sun moves and the weather turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eUqKU"&gt;For another, that 6kW system should take up between 350 and 450 square feet on a roof, roughly the same amount of space as a rack-mounted solar panel system, and the rest of the roof can be filled in with matched shingles from GAF. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avtxYi86x6fRAjC7XXcUyzWPdhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143032/Timberline_Solar_PK100_THP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GAF Energy&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KMSubY"&gt;But, like other solar roofs, it’ll definitely cost more than simply adding solar panels to an existing known-good roof. “It will cost the same as if you were to get a new roof and put solar on it,” says DeBono. (He declined to say how much each individual shingle costs.) But because a lot more people are getting new roofs each year than are adding solar — 5 million a year vs. 300,000 a year, he suggests — there’s a big opportunity for some of those people to add integrated renewable energy while they’re at it. Particularly since GAF already sells traditional shingles to cover one out of every four of those roofs, the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oiuhv1"&gt;The solar shingles don’t look &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like shingles, of course — there are covers for their wiring (for easier maintenance than having to remove the entire tile, says DeBono), and you’ll need a mid-circuit interrupt safety device for every 2kW of panel that fits in a visible box (though DeBono says you could put those in the attic instead of atop the roof). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Pkl3"&gt;GAF Energy is currently making all of these in a 130,000 square foot facility in San Jose, California, with a capacity of roughly 50 megawatts per year. That isn’t as tremendous an amount as it might sound — it’s a little over 8,300 homes per year if you assume each of them requires the average 6kW array. But DeBono says he’s also looking at it as just GAF Energy’s first manufacturing facility, with more potentially on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msSYnX"&gt;He says the new Timberline Solar panels are available now via sister company &lt;a href="https://www.gaf.com/en-us/roofing-contractors"&gt;GAF’s existing network of roofing contractors&lt;/a&gt; across the US East Coast and Texas — though these panels specifically aren’t available in big solar states California or Florida quite yet. He says it’ll take roughly 90 days for them to be listed with the California Energy Commission and possibly four to five months for additional wind testing in Florida. The company will expand to other states from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPk6t8"&gt;GAF Energy actually &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/11/gaf-energy-moves-its-solar-manufacturing-from-asia-to-the-us/"&gt;moved its solar manufacturing from Asia to California just this past year&lt;/a&gt;, and the timing isn’t all great: the solar industry is currently fighting against a new California proposal to charge solar panel owners a flat fee for every kW of solar panel capacity they hook up to the grid, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-12-16/california-plan-to-cut-solar-incentives-boiling-point"&gt;in addition to other reduced incentives for installing solar&lt;/a&gt;. “What has been proposed would be the death of the solar industry in California, and that’s not hyperbole,” DeBono tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/03/11/470097580/nevada-solar-power-business-struggles-to-keep-the-lights-on"&gt;what happened to the Nevada solar industry&lt;/a&gt; after that state phased out incentives and how the state &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/07/531952407/solar-firms-plan-to-return-to-nevada-after-new-law-restores-incentives"&gt;eventually changed its tune.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canada’s Cineplex closes more theaters as omicron spreads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gsf4iM5AgoJRsixqM-2XA_Iz7i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343814/acastro_210813_1777_theater_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KH3sqc"&gt;Cineplex, the largest theater chain in Canada, is preparing to temporarily shutter its Ontario auditoriums in response to a government mandate limiting indoor business to help curb the spread of omicron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xROMx4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ontario-to-shutter-cinemas-amid-omicron-surge-1235069095/"&gt;theater chain said&lt;/a&gt; that all 67 of its theaters in Ontario will close beginning Wednesday, January 5th, adding that the cinemas will reopen “as soon as we are allowed.” The measure comes as Ontario enacts restrictions on schools, dining, and entertainment venues to prevent what Ontario Premier &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-ontario-province-announces-curbs-prevent-spread-omicron-tsunami-2022-01-03/"&gt;Doug Ford characterized&lt;/a&gt; during a Monday news briefing as “a tsunami of new cases in the days and weeks ahead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNInq0"&gt;“To make it as easy as possible, we have already begun processing ticket refunds back to our guests’ original method of payment. There is no need for guests to contact our Guest Services or their local theatre team for a refund,” the theater chain said in a statement this week. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to welcoming guests back soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qmi3KO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cineplex previously announced temporary closures for 17 theaters in Quebec in December&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ILaHJ"&gt;Similar measures haven’t taken place on a wide scale in the US, and theaters haven’t suggested they’re going to make changes. It’s also worth noting that closures in Ontario were a result of a wider government initiative rather than an elective measure. President Joe Biden said in December that the US had &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/21/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-fight-against-covid-19/"&gt;no plans to issue lockdown orders&lt;/a&gt;, adding that with 2 million Americans fully vaccinated, “We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused. So that’s where we stand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCxR02"&gt;“We’re making sure that COVID-19 no longer closes businesses or schools,” the president said during the December 21st speech. “Last week, the federal court reinstated my administration’s vaccination-or-test — the vaccination-or-test rule for businesses with more than 100 employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0cliP"&gt;Last month, many of the nation’s largest theaters celebrated pandemic box office records with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843051/movie-theaters-spider-man-no-way-home-records-amc-regal-cinemark"&gt;explosive debut&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way&lt;/em&gt; Home even as COVID-19 cases continued to spike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoabjJ"&gt;However, multiple high-profile film and TV events have been impacted by the spread of omicron. Disney &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/scene/news/disney-book-boba-fett-red-carpet-1235142284/"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt; that a &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; fan event scheduled for this week would be postponed until February 8th, closer to the series finale. Additionally, a &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/peacemaker-hbo-max-cancels-la-red-carpet-premiere-omicron-1234903788/"&gt;red carpet event&lt;/a&gt; for James Gunn’s HBO Max title &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; has been canceled as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpM0Dh"&gt;The closures in Ontario come just weeks after the theater chain told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a statement that the majority of its theaters in Ontario would begin operating at 50 percent capacity in accordance with government directives. Cineplex &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CineplexMovies/status/1473020382722592768"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; closures for all 17 of its theaters in Quebec on December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s C-Lab program brings dehumidifier earbuds to CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsE0OCTEXbD-REWwdLjvGkhu4kY=/0x290:6873x4872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343752/CES_2022_C_Lab_1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung C-Lab program | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rJwbef"&gt;For CES 2022, Samsung revealed a new &lt;a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor"&gt;C-Lab startup lineup&lt;/a&gt; that includes pet and baby tech with a spin on promoting additional wearable tech promoting safety features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYmBW"&gt;The C-Lab is divided into both C-Lab Inside — an “in-house venture program” and C-Lab Outside — Samsung’s “startup acceleration program.” Established in 2012, the &lt;a href="https://www.claboutside.com/about#:~:text=C%2DLab%20Inside%20is%20Samsung's,corporate%20culture%20throughout%20the%20company."&gt;C-Lab Inside incubation program&lt;/a&gt; encourages employees to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/30/10687910/samsung-c-lab-rink-welt-tiptalk-ces-2016"&gt;venture out and work on&lt;/a&gt; experimental projects. The program expanded in 2018, creating the C-Lab Outside program. Four inside programs were set to exhibit at CES 2022, with projects ranging from test-taking technology and infant health tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Qev8U"&gt;Out of those featured, here are some that stood out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yQURFt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DearBuds (Outside): &lt;/strong&gt;Bluetooth earbud-like ear device that tracks ear humidity. In addition to tracking, the technology inside of the device can clear your ear by releasing light and heat to dehumidify your ear canal. The case that holds the ear devices provides a reading of how humid your ears are. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEbJicNSapGA4OXcoAnuzWP5DMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142763/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_2.43.18_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Linkface Co. Ltd’s DearBuds &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZQITch"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Innovision (Inside): &lt;/strong&gt;An app designed to help monitor eye development in infants and potential symptoms of strabismus, an eye misalignment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Innovision app on a mobile phone with the words our nursery mobile watches your baby’s eyes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK89QFF_H-4cv5MQpRGWoBfWNwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142797/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_2.44.55_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Innovision mobile app&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mCauwK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Prinker Korea, Inc. (Outside): &lt;/strong&gt;A mobile app and device combined experience that will allow you to create a temporary tattoo simply by choosing the design on your phone, spraying primer on your skin, and printing it on your skin.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hand holding a prinker device with an ink packet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9q0IHcVAPFNWeuc3IN15nHY-Ym8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142788/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_2.46.10_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Prinker &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="GbZ8Qj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Petnow (Outside): &lt;/strong&gt;A doggy biometrics app that lets you use your dog’s nose print to identify them. The app is said to relieve owners of “the worry” of tracking inserts like chips. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pet now mobile app on a smartphone with a dog getting scanned with the phone on the left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FI883ZrnwPyMuWM22fjtF88tj3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142805/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_2.46.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Petnow mobile app&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="kb4tlI"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tooning (Outside): &lt;/strong&gt;An AI cartoon creator where users can design and apply motions to their characters. These characters are able to do presentations, online campaigns, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Laptop and mobile tablet with tooning AI cartoon software on its screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b-Iw_-mFKCVpY78f5taU0GgCR_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142775/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_2.47.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Tooning AI Webtoon Program&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V39ont"&gt;Additionally, C-Lab’s exhibitors include health tech apps like MECS (Monitor Elderly Care System) — a diaper sensor that’ll allow caregivers to track diaper activity and movement — and apps that intersect health and pet care like PurrSong — an AI technology that allows owners to personify their cat’s health on their mobile device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sleep Number wants you to grow old in its smart beds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A render of the Sleep Number 360 smart bed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9ucr8BOvX-YzZ5MwsSJlW2Psq8=/130x0:4459x2886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343556/Sleep_Number_360_Smart_Bed__Sept__9__4_alt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Sleep Number 360 smart bed&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sleep Number&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LGV74P"&gt;Sleep Number’s 360 smart beds are a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10705482/sleep-number-it-bed-pricing-availability-ces-2016"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7490851/sleep-number-sleep-iq-kids-ces-2015"&gt;fixture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/8/14195396/sleep-number-360-smart-bed-ces"&gt;at CES&lt;/a&gt;, and this year is no exception. Today, Sleep Number is announcing the latest upgrades to its 360 smart beds, improving some of their built-in sensors and adding on surrounding tech like lights and mobility accessories that it calls “smart furniture.” The idea, according to Sleep Number, is to create more accessible smart beds so that people can age more comfortably or recover from injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sruALL"&gt;“Smart furniture” is a new addition that surrounds the 360 smart bed. While it looks like one of those fancy headboards with built-in shelves, Sleep Number says it was built to support sleep health and make its beds more accessible. For example, the smart furniture includes mobility aids to help sleepers who may need extra help entering or exiting the bed. It also features individual audio and noise reduction technology meant to block out environmental noise and has built-in reading lights, charging ports, and storage areas. Lastly, the furniture has ambient lighting designed to help maintain normal circadian rhythms — think amber-colored lighting at night and a dawn simulator in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of the smart furniture with descriptions of features like ambient lighting and mobility aids." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wM7kCR0xziZfBTaeNgT6xJkERbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132478/Sleep_Number_Smart_Furniture__Sept_9_2021__6.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sleep Number&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Number’s new smart furniture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4VeGSj"&gt;As for the bed itself, this year Sleep Number seems particularly keen to position the 360 bed as a potential healthcare tool — though overall, the updates seem to be focused on refining its smart capabilities rather than introducing groundbreaking new features. Sleep Number says the new 360 bed can continuously monitor a person’s general wellness, sleep health behaviors, chronic sleep issues, and generate real-time insights and suggestions for sleepers, their caregivers, and doctors. It also says that over time, the bed’s AI can identify abnormal events and notify the sleeper that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul8nTn"&gt;Sleep Number’s always given sleep insights and wellness reports, but the company says its improved sensing capabilities move it closer to a future where it can proactively alert users of oncoming illness and risks for conditions like insomnia, sleep apnea, or cardiac events. To be clear, this does not mean Sleep Number’s beds can diagnose any of these medical conditions right now. That would require FDA clearance and even the most advanced smartwatches aren’t quite there yet, though there is plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;research being done on that front&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of the SleepIQ app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0tIklZgsPLiJn3SRDLmhTe8xu0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132477/04_Health_Awareness.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sleep Number&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yV7Qq3"&gt;Better accuracy isn’t all that exciting on paper, even though it might be an impressive achievement under the hood. Sleep Number says that it’s used over 12 billion hours of sleep data to “significantly innovate its 360 smart bed.” Aside from software updates, physical updates include small changes like adding “high-tech textiles,” antimicrobial components, and graphite-infused foam that supposedly keeps sleepers cool by encouraging airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz0L6v"&gt;In a briefing, Sleep Number also noted that the new 360 smart beds will be able to actively monitor body temperature to create “microclimates,” as well as tilt the bed to improve airflow by elevating the head without sacrificing spinal alignment. For elderly or injured sleepers, Sleep Number also says you can adjust the height to make it easier to get in and out of bed. Again, this isn’t as fun as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/8/14195396/sleep-number-360-smart-bed-ces"&gt;foot-warming feature&lt;/a&gt; it introduced in 2017, but greater accessibility and accuracy are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NODYZ"&gt;The new 360 smart beds will be available starting in 2023, with prices starting at $1,099. The smart furniture will also be available in 2023, but Sleep Number hasn’t yet decided pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZVDDx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the accessories you’ll need for your new PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8EKGm6"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is becoming more available than it once was, but even with the increased frequency of restocks, Sony’s next-gen console remains difficult to find. If you were lucky enough to secure a launch unit or receive a PS5 as a holiday gift, however, picking up a few accessories can help ensure you get the most out of your new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fonFGm"&gt;From headsets and remotes to M.2 SSDs that allow you to expand your console’s storage capacity — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;that’s a thing now&lt;/a&gt;, after all — these are just a few PS5 accessories we suggest picking up from the get-go, some of which are now available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ken Levine’s ambitious new game is reportedly in development hell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BioShock Infinite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2LbuszK48We3GHnxYWN1FCTfS0=/46x0:1846x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342948/BioShockTC_Bio1_AndrewRyan_Statue_05.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjNDOh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Ken Levine is reportedly facing trouble. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Jason Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, Levine’s studio Ghost Story Games and its long-awaited debut project have been plagued by shifting design goals and an overambitious vision. It’s not a new criticism of Levine, but it suggests that the game’s nearly eight-year waiting period might not end any time soon and hints at some details about what Ghost Story is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZT9bK"&gt;Schreier’s story indicates that Ghost Story, a division of Take-Two Interactive staffed with former members of Levine’s old studio Irrational, was originally supposed to release a small game in 2017. The project was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-28-ken-levine-teases-new-first-person-sci-fi-project"&gt;a sci-fi shooter&lt;/a&gt; set on a “mysterious space station” where three factions would respond to the player’s actions. (While &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; compares it to &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, the setting sounds similar to Levine’s earlier space horror game &lt;em&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/em&gt;.) But the project’s scope was seemingly bigger than the 30-person team could handle, including a “complicated dialogue system that would morph based on player choices.” As of 2022, the project has apparently been rebooted multiple times and still has no name or release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XkUmNJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game has reportedly changed directions multiple times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FXblC"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, part of the delay stems from Levine’s mercurial management style and perfectionism. Like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/6/5474722/why-did-irrational-close-bioshock-infinite"&gt;previous reports from his time at Irrational&lt;/a&gt;, it describes a place where projects would get suddenly overhauled or scrapped after months of work. One anecdote describes studio members joking about convincing Levine to adopt their ideas via “Kenception,” a reference to the artificially planted thoughts in Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;. An open-ended release timeline has apparently been a double-edged sword, with Levine reportedly saying that the studio’s ongoing budget is a “rounding error” in Take-Two’s operation, which could give its game an indefinitely long development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYa81y"&gt;But Ghost Story’s core mission also contains some built-in tension. The studio &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/30/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-compares-new-game-to-a-much-more-ambitious-shadow-of-mordor-nemesis-system"&gt;grew alongside&lt;/a&gt; Levine’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/21/5534258/ken-levine-next-project"&gt;fascination with “narrative Legos,”&lt;/a&gt; his term for the kind of procedurally generated drama produced by &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor’s&lt;/em&gt; Nemesis system&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball"&gt;some recent indie games&lt;/a&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report also mentions the procedurally generated games &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Void Bastards&lt;/em&gt; as potential influences.) At the same time, it’s apparently been pursuing the feel of a heavily scripted and polished big-budget 3D experience, something that’s difficult to produce with a highly variable story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q42ZS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; franchise, meanwhile, has proceeded without Levine — although a new installment has also &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/bioshock-4-everything-we-know-about-the-new-bioshock"&gt;been in development&lt;/a&gt; for some time with no release in sight. An unrelated &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; sequel has followed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724301/system-shock-live-action-tv-series-nightdive-binge-streaming-platform"&gt;even more tortured&lt;/a&gt; development roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImwkMq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/em&gt; helped define &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/18/12539476/what-makes-an-immersive-sim-and-why-are-they-staging-a-comeback"&gt;the immersive sim&lt;/a&gt;, a genre that gave players a feeling of free choice through versatile but often painstakingly handcrafted systems. It’s a style that feels ripe for an experiment with infinitely generated conflict, especially &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/1/10/3853198/ken-levine-bioshock-infinite-vgas"&gt;paired with Levine’s love&lt;/a&gt; of lofty, clashing philosophical movements. But for now, those clashes are apparently happening inside the studio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple briefly crossed a $3 trillion market cap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUabvvoSkfx96vZLhek6NKJjLLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342842/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VLcZu"&gt;Apple’s market cap briefly passed $3 trillion on Monday more than a year after it surpassed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;the $2 trillion mark&lt;/a&gt; and three years after eclipsing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Hhyj"&gt;Apple’s huge success is due in large part to the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and remains a cash cow for the company. But Apple continues to see strong momentum in its other businesses as well, with its services and Mac divisions reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;all-time highs in its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCrPC4"&gt;Shortly after hitting the $3 trillion milestone at around 1:45PM ET, Apple’s market cap dipped below it again. Apple’s market cap must be above the $3 trillion mark when the market closes at 4PM ET for it to officially be designated as the first publicly-traded company with that valuation, and it ended below $3 trillion on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvSXK3"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company in the trillion-dollar club; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value%5D"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion. (Facebook parent company Meta breached the $1 trillion milestone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554502/facebook-1-trillion-dollar-market-cap-company-business"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sitting below it.) In recent years, Apple has also jostled with others for the crown of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. It passed Saudi Aramco &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though it was overtaken for a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;by Microsoft in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oQ9fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 4:36PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple’s market cap ended the day below $3 trillion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla opens showroom in region of China associated with genocide allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TE0Uk8LWI1b5BFCI0WWHVN6AJ5k=/0x129:3632x2550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342716/1328265762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fv50Wp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-opens-showroom-in-chinas-xinjiang-region-at-center-of-u-s-genocide-allegations-11641214630"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that on New Year’s Eve, Tesla &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/L8A9JyRJy"&gt;revealed on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; the launch of a new dealership in Xinjiang, a region where the Chinese government has been accused of human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bx6b5DSVY4Ugj5H48UjGV5KQSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142299/tesla_weibo_xinjiang.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Weibo / Tesla&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpJPcm"&gt;Just over a week ago, President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that “[we] call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to immediately end genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY9ERZ"&gt;Earlier in December, the Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839970/dji-chinese-military-industrial-complex-investment-blacklist"&gt;sanctioned several Chinese companies for their alleged participation in the abuses&lt;/a&gt;, including drone maker DJI, blocking US investments in the company, and the Biden administration announced plans for a “diplomatic boycott” during the Beijing Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0jmvC"&gt;Now Tesla has a showroom in Urumqi, the region’s capital. The automaker has had an uneven relationship with China’s government for years, including when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17553094/tesla-china-gigafactory-cars-deal-agreement"&gt;signed a deal to open a factory in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and at the beginning of 2021, when that factory’s output &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252765/tesla-profit-q4-2020-earnings-elon-musk-record-sales"&gt;helped push Tesla to its first annual profit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBENPi"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes, the US accusations of genocide are based on reports that the Chinese government has imprisoned over 1 million Uyghur people and other minorities in the region, subjugating them with forced labor, surveillance, and population controls. The Chinese government maintains that its “facts and truth on Xinjiang-related issues” refute the allegations and claims that it’s imposed measures like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14682068/china-gps-trackers-xinjiang-uighur-violence"&gt;real-time GPS vehicle tracking&lt;/a&gt; to fight terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hjpOv"&gt;Other US companies have been linked to the region, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;reports that Apple suppliers had used forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji"&gt;Best Buy and Home Depot&lt;/a&gt; removed security cameras they were selling after the brands were linked to surveillance. Most recently, Intel made a statement that it would not use labor or goods sourced in the region &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods"&gt;before deleting the post and apologizing on Chinese social media sites&lt;/a&gt;, saying “the paragraph about Xinjiang in the letter is only for expressing the original intention of compliance and legality, not for its intention or position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa4WFR"&gt;Tesla dissolved its PR department in 2019 and has not commented on the new location.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Apple HomeKit bug can send iOS devices into a death spiral </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTqYAp00NgK0PiuWRv3U86YWtgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342714/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ia3g4y"&gt;You should always be wary of invites to a stranger’s Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djTWM3"&gt;That’s the upshot of a new piece of security research that has found a vulnerability capable of locking iOS devices into a spiral of freezing, crashing, and rebooting if a user connects to a sabotaged Apple Home device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8v4KJ"&gt;The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trevorspiniolas/status/1477185285784051712?s=21"&gt;discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas&lt;/a&gt;, can be exploited through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"&gt;HomeKit API&lt;/a&gt;, the software interface that allows an iOS app to control compatible smart home devices. If an attacker creates a HomeKit device with an extremely long name — around 500,000 characters — then an iOS device that connects to it will become unresponsive once it reads the device name and enter a cycle of freezing and rebooting that can only be ended by wiping and restoring the iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="idDwXd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most likely way to trigger the exploit would be through a spoof Home network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRvaRh"&gt;What’s more, since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device will trigger the crash again, with the cycle continuing until the device owner switches off the option to sync Home devices from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVIby9"&gt;Though it’s possible that an attacker could compromise a user’s existing HomeKit-enabled device, the most likely way the exploit would be triggered is if the attacker created a spoof Home network and tricked a user into joining via a phishing email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVMO8"&gt;To guard against the attack, the main precaution for iOS users is to instantly reject any invitations to join an unfamiliar Home network. Additionally, iOS users who currently use smart home devices can protect themselves by entering the Control Center and disabling the setting “Show Home Controls.” (This won’t prevent Home devices from being used but limits which information is accessible through the Control Center.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHQzpH"&gt;Spiniolas &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;released details on his personal website&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, 2022. He was &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT209600"&gt;previously credited by Apple&lt;/a&gt; for discovering a vulnerability in macOS Mojave that was patched in 2019. The new vulnerability affects the latest iOS version, 15.2, and goes back at least as far as 14.7, Spiniolas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QorAC"&gt;Spiniolas also accused Apple of being slow to respond to the initial disclosure, which was made months before the public release. The researcher shared emails with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that appeared to show an Apple representative acknowledging the issue and requesting Spiniolas refrain from publishing details until early 2022. The blog post detailing the vulnerability claims that Apple was made aware of the issue on August 10, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvC0YM"&gt;“Apple’s lack of transparency is not only frustrating to security researchers who often work for free, it poses a risk to the millions of people who use Apple products in their day-to-day lives by reducing Apple’s accountability on security matters,” Spiniolas wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UWFLY"&gt;Apple had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OiCFczPA_I9r0afqJmI7VaxiOk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342687/MN6U3_AV1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6AkUG"&gt;Apple is now selling a new set of special edition AirPod Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/01/apple-launches-special-edition-tiger-airpods-pro-for-chinese-new-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in time for the Chinese New Year, which begins on February 1st, 2022. Just as the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218360/apple-lunar-new-year-ox-airpods-pro-asia"&gt;Year of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is engraving a special emoji on the AirPods Pro case — this time, themed for the Year of the Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6XzHM"&gt;At first glance, it seems like only the standard tiger emoji is featured on the case — but turns out, it’s just a bit more snazzy with sparkles and fireworks surrounding the tiger face topped off with a cute tiger growly-face hood. Other than that, the only other difference is the retail box has the same emoji in red on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haCVc645ugqdcPA2D9vYCFQrI8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142021/airpods_tiger.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images from Apple Store website&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New special edition Year of the Tiger AirPods on the left comparing to AirPods Pro with a regular tiger emoji on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tprz5U"&gt;The new Special Edition AirPods Pro - Tiger (the official name) is available to order now in several Asian markets, including Hong Kong (with a heavy backorder until May 1st as of writing), where it retails for HK$1,999 ($256.38 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCXc4c"&gt;Apple also is &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4720927805801613"&gt;giving away&lt;/a&gt; free red envelopes with a golden embossing of different Chinese zodiac emojis — all wearing the same tiger hood. It’s a cute addition for those traditionally gifting money for the celebration of the new year but is only available if purchased in an Apple Store that sells the special edition AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyp3H"&gt;While people in markets like the US might feel left out — you could just order regular AirPods Pro and get a free tiger emoji engraving... it’s really not that different. The existence of these yearly special editions is perhaps a literal product of courting the Chinese market — a country in which Apple historically has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423347/apple-freedom-speech-expression-information-china-censorship-policy"&gt;bend&lt;/a&gt; to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4WexEA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The four numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on your iPad in China","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dxj4xJ"&gt;Apple’s Beats by Dre brand also put out a pair of new Beats Studio Buds — which has a case that is adorned with golden tribal-style tiger stripes on a classic Beats red body. The stripes continue onto the actual buds themselves, unlike the standard-fare buds the special edition AirPods Pro come with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gI7PtC"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re celebrating the Lunar New Year with our special-edition Beats Studio Buds. As a tribute to the Year of the Tiger, the Buds feature an all-red design with gold tiger print accents.
