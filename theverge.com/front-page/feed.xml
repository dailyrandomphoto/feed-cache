    <title>Chrome is blocking popular extension The Great Suspender, but there’s a way to recover your tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfUIJmI6mv4ZOly5Lc3GLKS9xeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770590/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f9GYXk"&gt;Google has apparently blocked The Great Suspender extension from Chrome, with existing users now receiving a message that it has “been disabled because it contains malware.” It’s also been removed from the Chrome Web Store, with &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg"&gt;any links to it&lt;/a&gt; now leading to a 404 page. Some are worried about losing their tabs, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit users have found a way to recover them&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers’&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1357397229980549126"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrKyyM"&gt;The Great Suspender was a hugely useful extension — minus the malware, at least — for keeping your browser running smoothly. The tool would automatically shut down tabs that you hadn’t looked at for a while, replacing them with a blank gray screen. Return to the tab, and you could click to reload back to where you were. Given Chrome’s tendency to hog much of a computer’s memory, the extension was a simple way to keep your browser moving a bit faster, without actually forcing you to close old tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSuIBvY0crMurfEZ6R1FC4rcTaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281952/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_1.19.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The warning Chrome gives users if they have the extension installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ABuZ9"&gt;If you used the extension and are looking to get your tabs back, the steps are simple, if a bit tedious. If the tabs were open, you can go to them and click into the URL bar. There will be a ton of text that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YKZ40Y"&gt;chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=%22Dawn%22%20Dario%20Marianelli%20(Pride%20%26%20Prejudice)%20Piano%20solo%20%26%20Tutorial%20-%20P.%20Barton%20-%20YouTube&amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;uri=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJXGLl_sEDU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aHXQ8J"&gt;At the end will be the address for the page you were on. Deleting everything before the URL and hitting enter will bring the page back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuNDxE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit user avatar_ENG also discovered&lt;/a&gt; you can still get those tabs back by searching your Chrome history. It’s basically the same process as above: you search for the extension’s ID, klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg, then open the tabs and remove the junk. It may be an annoying process, but it’s better than losing any work or incredible memes you had open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZpscW"&gt;Neither Google nor the developers of the extension immediately responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on hackers who steal rare usernames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3xvqURkdPcl31BNC6cwc4Hxgy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770421/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssQNvO"&gt;Instagram has disabled hundreds of accounts that were stolen as part of online hacking operations designed to gain access to and sell rare and coveted usernames, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Both TikTok and Twitter also took action on some of the accounts belonging to the same hackers, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/facebook-instagram-tiktok-and-twitter-target-resellers-of-hacked-accounts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29"&gt;reports journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6KGp"&gt;The Facebook-owned platform set its sights mainly on the community surrounding OGUsers, a website well-known for trafficking in stolen usernames and helping facilitate the hacking of these accounts through methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a user gains control of someone’s phone number and uses it to reset passwords and take control of social media handles. News of Instagram’s enforcement was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-cyber-idUSKBN2A42HY"&gt;first reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKTe4L"&gt;“Today, we’re removing hundreds of accounts connected to members of the OGUsers forum. They harass, extort and cause harm to the Instagram community, and we will continue to do all we can to make it difficult for them to profit from Instagram usernames,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The disclosure is notable because it’s the first time the platform has publicly shared information regarding moderation against username hackers. Earlier this week, Instagram released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262154/instagram-recently-deleted-feature-update"&gt;new feature that lets people recover deleted posts&lt;/a&gt;, in the event a hacker takes control of their account and wipes it clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXQ8C5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Instagram are taking action against online username-stealing communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwDrTZ"&gt;Krebs reported on Thursday that the crackdown was something of a joint effort, with Twitter and TikTok also taking action against popular OGUsers community members at the same time on those companies’ respective platforms (although it’s unclear how much coordination there was between the three companies or how far-reaching TikTok and Twitter’s enforcement was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnmiCJ"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to find and stop inauthentic behavior, we recently reclaimed a number of TikTok usernames that were being used for account squatting,” TikTok told Krebs in a statement. “We will continue to focus on staying ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of bad actors, including cooperating with third parties and others in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiNeLO"&gt;In addition to disabling the accounts that were stolen, rendering them worthless, the social platforms have also disabled some accounts of well-known OGUsers middlemen who act as intermediaries during username transactions by holding funds in escrow in exchange for a cut of the fee, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydl6Sr"&gt;OGUsers made headlines last summer when a small cohort of hackers affiliated with the site allegedly participated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327769/twitter-bitcoin-scam-news-updates"&gt;unprecedented Twitter hack &lt;/a&gt;that involved resetting the passwords on the accounts of dozens of high-profile individuals and companies, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and using their access to run a bitcoin scam. Like the individual at the center of the Twitter hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355746/twitter-hack-teen-hearing-zoombombed-zoom-call-judge"&gt;then-17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of the hackers Instagram is cracking down on today and those who frequent OGUsers are minors, often drawn into the community by the allure of stealing and retaining a rare username of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFNLnl"&gt;These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"&gt;rules barring the buying and selling of accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them. SIM hacking is a popular method, but standard phishing as well as sustained online harassment, extortion, and even swatting are other known techniques, notes &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next victim of the global microchip shortage is Ford’s most profitable truck, the F-150</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-gXXx4sGzsUSGBbsteEa1nOnbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770242/All_new_F_150_006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqCHrh"&gt;Many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;have had to scale back car production&lt;/a&gt; due to a global computer chip shortage, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/ford-forced-to-cut-pickup-production-due-to-semiconductor-shortage-.html"&gt;CNBC is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the shortages are finally hitting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;America’s most popular vehicle&lt;/a&gt;: the Ford F-150. According to the report, Ford is temporarily cutting the number of shifts in its truck production plants in half: its Dearborn, Michigan, factory is going from three shifts a week to one, and its Kansas City, Missouri, plant is going from three shifts to two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu7At1"&gt;CNBC quotes Ford spokesperson Kelli Felker as saying Ford expects the plants to return to normal operation in a couple of weeks, and the company is “working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKO0hg"&gt;This isn’t the first time microchip shortages have hit the car industry, or even Ford. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen had to change car production in December&lt;/a&gt; due to the shortage, and &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-cuts-car-production-on-massive-chip-shortage"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/general-motors-hit-by-chip-shortage-will-cut-production-at-four-plants.html"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; have also had to cut back. &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have had to slow their truck production lines as well. For Ford’s part, earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;it had to shut down the factory&lt;/a&gt; that made Ford Escapes and Lincoln Corsairs for a week because it couldn’t get the computer parts it needed. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/overview-of-japan-carmakers-halting-output-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has an overview&lt;/a&gt; of how most of Japan’s automakers are affected one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLn9SS"&gt;While the shortages are hitting the entire industry, the F-150 is a big deal in the US, where the iconic F-series is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the bestselling vehicle in the country&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/why-the-ford-f-150-is-a-profit-machine"&gt;Ford’s most profitable vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, so making fewer of them isn’t likely to be a decision the motor company would make unless it had to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnLjnc"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; often ask the question “what’s a computer?” but I suspect most people wouldn’t answer “the F-150.” But modern cars have computer systems for almost every component these days, from digital speedometers to vital vehicle functions like controlling emissions and emergency brake systems. If Ford, or other car manufacturers, isn’t able to get the computer chips it needs, it won’t be able to build functioning modern cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQDd"&gt;Of course, the chip shortages aren’t just hitting the car industry — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;AMD, Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;Microsoft, and Sony&lt;/a&gt; were famously not able to meet demand with their launches last year, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F02%2F03%2Fqualcomm-qcom-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Qualcomm’s CEO is warning&lt;/a&gt; that it’s not just the latest, highest-tech products that will see shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap3GFq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patent application imagines charging cables that might not fray so easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYm_3AqklTk6timJyw4xedSps0g=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770228/MD818.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lightning to USB-A cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hx2l9U"&gt;Apple’s charging cables aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/30/9072323/lightning-cable-issues"&gt;exactly known for their durability&lt;/a&gt;. They often fray after a year or two and can even break down to the point where they won’t charge your device at all. (I’ve also noticed they can turn an increasingly sour shade of yellow.) But Apple is apparently working on some ideas to make its cables more durable, &lt;a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;amp;r=13&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;S1=(apple.AANM.+AND+20210204.PD.)&amp;amp;OS=aanm/apple+and+pd/2/4/2021&amp;amp;RS=(AANM/apple+AND+PD/20210204)"&gt;filing a patent application&lt;/a&gt; for a “Cable with Variable Stiffness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiL1Pb"&gt;The patent, first &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/apple-may-have-a-solution-for-fraying-lightning-cables"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes some different ideas for a cable that wouldn’t fray as easily. The methods would give different parts of the cable varying levels of stiffness, while keeping the cable uniformly thick. They would also replace what Apple calls the “strain relief sleeve” — the stiff cap you’ll find at the ends of many cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht6xY5"&gt;The strain relief sleeve helps prevent the cable from breaking due to bends, which can be helpful since cables are often bent sharply near the ends to plug them in. The thing is, those sleeves often don’t stop cables from fraying anyway. Apple’s ideas in this patent vary the flexibility and stiffness across an entire cable, which would theoretically protect better against fraying no matter where you regularly bend it, all without increasing the thickness (meaning no more strain relief sleeves).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auNqs7Z-JHYkSD3zXSKZEa_16Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281634/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_9.50.41_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram from Apple’s patent for a cable with variable stiffness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Go8OWt"&gt;This is just a patent application, and there’s no guarantee that Apple will use this design in future cables. But the fact that Apple has filed this application is a good sign that it is thinking about cable durability. Hopefully we see some improvements down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ppWnm"&gt;Two Google engineers have quit over the treatment of Timnit Gebru, former co-lead of the ethical AI team. David Baker, an engineering director, said Gebru’s dismissal “extinguished” his desire to remain at the company. Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, said he was leaving because Gebru and April Christina Curley, a diversity recruiter, were “wronged.” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations/two-google-engineers-resign-over-firing-of-ai-ethics-researcher-timnit-gebru-idUSKBN2A4090"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H9xg4"&gt;“We cannot say we believe in making a more understanding, informed world, and then ignore how our products amplify biases,” Baker wrote &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdavid-baker-82552%2Fdetail%2Ftreasury%2Fposition%3A1871451%2F%3FentityUrn%3Durn%253Ali%253Afsd_profileTreasuryMedia%253A%28ACoAAAABpx0BNDjuO71etPuXTsHCmQvmWfNlj2w%252C1611115642127%29%26section%3Dposition%253A1871451%26treasuryCount%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266513%2Fgoogle-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a farewell note to colleagues&lt;/a&gt;. “We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwzPvc"&gt;The departures point to an ongoing conflict between Google management and staff. In December, Gebru said she was abruptly fired over an &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;email she sent to the Brain Women and Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt;. In the note, she spoke openly about her doubts regarding Google’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. After she went public, &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;2,695 employees signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; calling on Google to do better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfbLLV"&gt;Later that month, Curley tweeted about her September 2020 firing. “THEY DO NOT WANT BLACK TALENT,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135837585534976"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;. “Take it from ME- their most successful BLACK QUEER WOMAN recruiter who they fired in the middle of a MF pandemic because they were tired of hearing me call them out on their racist bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQe4xn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Take it from ME- their most successful BLACK QUEER WOMAN recruiter who they fired in the middle of a MF pandemic because they were tired of hearing me call them out on their racist bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;— Real Abril  (@RealAbril) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135838365712384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEsFIN"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “We don’t agree with the way April describes her termination, but it’s not appropriate for us to provide a commentary about her claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTmvnE"&gt;Kannan announced his resignation on Twitter on February 3rd. He said the company’s treatment of Gebru and Curley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357130615745892355"&gt;crossed a personal red line&lt;/a&gt;: “retaliation against a teammate who stands up for something I believe in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hji5BL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday was my last day at Google. I left because Google's mistreatment of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timnitGebru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RealAbril&lt;/a&gt; crossed a personal red line I wrote down when I started the job. I know I gained a lot from Google, but I also gained a lot from both of their work, and they were wronged.&lt;/p&gt;— Vinesh Kannan (@vineshgkannan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357115873723637764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHDBTw"&gt;In January, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union, building on years of employee activism. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Today, that organization, the Alphabet Workers Union, has more than 800 members. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3SKzU1"&gt;If you have been having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;a hard time&lt;/a&gt; finding &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; consoles in stock, you have another chance to get your hands on one or both of these next-gen consoles. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the consoles available for purchase today at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4on9Q"&gt;Like past restocks, Walmart is selling these next-gen consoles exclusively online through its official website as well as through the Walmart mobile app. It’s unknown when Walmart plans to sell these consoles again in stores, so if you want to buy either console currently, online is the only available method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkD512"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles today, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1U3tvW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snydbQ"&gt;Due to the popularity of these next-gen consoles, we anticipate that they will sell out &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;quickly. So if you plan to buy this console either for yourself or a loved one, don’t hesitate to click the purchase button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPzI7P"&gt;Both consoles have been out of stock for almost three months, and demand has been through the roof. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263821/sony-earnings-q3-2020-ps5-launch-sales"&gt;Sony reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that it sold 4.5 million PS5 consoles last year alone, following the November 12th launch. Last week, Microsoft, while not releasing specific numbers in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, noted that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats call on FCC to expand remote learning connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8cPp9BWMmgvZ3QKnhlv84_bhE0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769547/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agYGqG"&gt;In an open letter on Thursday, dozens of Democrats called on Federal Communications Commission Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;to expand the use of broadband funds&lt;/a&gt; for students struggling to stay connected and participate in remote learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpCJi4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;In a letter to Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt;, signed by over 30 Senate Democrats, including Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA), they requested that the FCC use E-Rate program funds to connect students with devices and home internet access who are currently unable to participate in online learning as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The E-Rate program provides universal service funding to connect schools and libraries to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0e2kR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Your prompt action would provide an essential down payment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h6vQZ6"&gt;“We urge you to now use your new leadership of the FCC to depart from the prior Commission’s erroneous position,” the senators wrote. “Although the funds currently available through the E-Rate will not be enough to connect every student across the country, your prompt action would provide an essential down payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCWkMT"&gt;Previous FCC Chair Ajit Pai denied these calls for E-Rate expansion throughout his tenure at the agency during the pandemic. A minority commissioner at the time called on the FCC to use the E-Rate program to ensure students have the devices and connectivity needed to participate in remote learning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;in an op-ed for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ekfzg"&gt;There are already indications that the FCC will take action on the issue. Earlier this week, Rosenworcel announced that the FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/e-rate-schools-libraries-usf-program"&gt;would seek comment&lt;/a&gt; on petitions to open up E-Rate program funds for use in supporting remote learning during the pandemic, a first step in more substantial changes to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oANSVh"&gt;“We need to get to work to update E-Rate funding so all our students can be connected to virtual classrooms, no matter who they are or where they live,” Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “Kids shouldn’t have to do homework in parking lots because that’s the only place they can get online. We can do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLn9Lq"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsradH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UREgKa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly requiring 10-hour overnight shifts for some workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lG6JQg4dMS1gv10wrADL0pqu7Js=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769527/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hUccL6"&gt;Amazon recently told workers at its in DCH1 warehouse in Chicago they had to take 10-hour overnight shifts at a new warehouse or risk losing their jobs, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVwuZm"&gt;The shifts, known as “megacycle” shifts, typically begin around 1AM and end around lunchtime. The DCH1 warehouse used to have a variety of shifts including an eight-hour overnight shift, a five-hour morning shift, or a four-hour morning shift. But DCH1 is shutting down, the company told workers, and for anyone who wants to move to a new Amazon warehouse the 10-hour megacycle shift is their only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ft0v0"&gt;The shifts are meant to improve efficiency, according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, and workers at delivery stations in other cities have already transitioned to the new megacycle shifts, along with half of Amazon’s last-mile delivery network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhjxB1"&gt;“We are excited to have recently launched three new, next generation delivery stations for DCH1 employees where they can continue to work and grow as an integral part of the Amazon team in state-of-art facilities,” Amazon spokesperson Jen Crowcroft said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our associates are the heart and soul of our operations, and we are happy to continue to offer great, flexible career opportunities in world class facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWYUlc"&gt;DCH1 Amazonians United, a group representing Amazon workers at DCH1, said the new schedule was “unworkable” for many of the warehouse employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon"&gt;Ten-hour shifts&lt;/a&gt; are not uncommon at Amazon warehouses, and many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892693/amazon-protest-time-off-part-time-workers-sacramento-fired"&gt;warehouse employees are part-time&lt;/a&gt; workers not eligible for benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxnTF4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;Warehouse workers have criticized Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for how the company has treated them during the coronavirus pandemic. Workers in New York, Chicago, and Detroit staged walk-offs last spring, which pushed the company to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204254/amazon-warehouse-walkout-coronavirus-protections-masks-temperature"&gt;temperature checks and provide masks&lt;/a&gt;, offer &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-employees-with-fever-5-hours-pay"&gt;partial pay&lt;/a&gt; in some instances when it sends sick employees home, and implement cleaning protocols to protect its workers from becoming infected. The company has largely dismissed most of the workers’ complaints as “unfounded,” with executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206108/amazon-chris-smalls-warehouse-strike-nyc-jay-carney-bernie-sanders-coronavirus-safety"&gt;insulting one fired worker&lt;/a&gt; who helped organize a strike at its Staten Island facility last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIdicr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 4th, 1:21PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bezos’ climate fund faces a reckoning with Amazon’s pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-CLIMATE-AMAZON-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4KO_pBbqaNFZzAURTGIWBKYnis=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68769195/1169518004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos speaks to the media on the companys sustainability efforts on September 19, 2019 in Washington,DC. | Photo credit should read ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;People living with Amazon’s pollution see gaps in Bezos’ funding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7t8fLB"&gt;Once he steps down as CEO of Amazon later this year, Jeff Bezos will have more time to focus on his “&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;passions&lt;/a&gt;,” including his $10 billion Earth Fund aimed at addressing climate change. That’s a huge sum that could have an outsized impact on climate action, but vulnerable communities — including those affected by Amazon’s warehouses — say they’ve been excluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8X6tX"&gt;So far, Bezos has only allocated $791 million — just under 8 percent of the total fund — to 16 environmental organizations. That injection of cash is still enormous. His grants, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, have already fattened the budgets of some mainstream advocacy groups, such as the Environmental Defense Fund. The majority of his grants went to larger organizations with less diverse leadership. Smaller, grassroots groups representing communities of color say they’ve been left out. They’re asking for recognition and funding. And they want Bezos to do more for communities living with pollution from Amazon’s warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6W3Ud"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ogl0Qr"&gt;In February 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;Bezos pledged&lt;/a&gt; to give some of his personal fortune to “scientists, activists, [and] NGOs” tackling climate change. Since the pandemic erupted in March, Bezos’ personal wealth has ballooned by more than &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/12/22/amazon-and-walmart-have-raked-in-billions-in-additional-profits-during-the-pandemic-and-shared-almost-none-of-it-with-their-workers/#:~:text=Together%2C%20they%20have%20earned%20an,companies%20studied%20in%20our%20report."&gt;$75 billion&lt;/a&gt;. While many other businesses shut down during stay-at-home orders, Amazon’s business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;boomed&lt;/a&gt; because more people shopped online. Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to grow&lt;/a&gt;, too, despite Bezos’ “passion” for climate action and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;2019 commitment&lt;/a&gt; from his company to reign in its climate pollution.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An aerial view of San Bernardino International Airport, which has attracted some major businesses, like Kohl’s, Pepboys Auto, Mattel, and Stater Bros. to establish warehouses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjlyYQ"&gt;“I’m actually really frustrated with this. He has an opportunity to do so much with the funds that he has provided out there, although I would still consider it chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people,” says Gabriela Mendez, a community organizer with the nonprofit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ). CCAEJ has fought to clean up the air in California’s Inland Empire, a region with some of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;worst smog&lt;/a&gt; in the nation. It’s a community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;increasingly dominated&lt;/a&gt; by warehouses for e-commerce, and a lot of pollution comes from vehicles moving goods to and from those facilities. Amazon happens to be the &lt;a href="http://roseinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Spring2018_Amazon-in-the-IE.pdf"&gt;biggest private employer in the region&lt;/a&gt;, so CCAEJ and other local groups have pushed the company to guarantee stronger worker protections and to switch to zero-emissions electric trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mPKXL"&gt;Mendez says there’s been an onslaught of truck traffic through her neighborhood since an Amazon warehouse opened up nearby. “He really needs to take a look at this and prioritize these communities,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EB45qg"&gt;The five established “big green” groups that benefited the most from Bezos’ Earth Fund were each allotted $100 million in November, or nearly two-thirds of Bezos’ first round of funding. They are the Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. These organizations have traditionally held more sway in politics; for instance, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s former executive director, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238544/trump-pollution-rollbacks-coronavirus-covid-19-gina-mccarthy-epa"&gt;Gina McCarthy,&lt;/a&gt; is now Joe Biden’s domestic climate czar. They are also groups that have historically worked more closely with corporations on sustainability initiatives, such as the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdRKUD"&gt;The EDF tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has already received its $100 million grant. That’s equal to about half of its typical operating budget for a year, although it plans to spend the money over three years. The majority of the spending will go toward launching a satellite in 2022 to monitor methane emissions, a super greenhouse gas, and building a platform to make that data publicly available. (When asked if Bezos’ Blue Origin would play a role, EDF said it had previously signed a contract with SpaceX to launch the satellite prior to receiving an Earth Fund grant). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUcRb2"&gt;A smaller portion of EDF’s grant will go toward efforts to vet so-called “nature-based solutions.” These are popular with companies who want to offset their pollution by investing in things like forest conservation. Many of these projects don’t permanently trap greenhouse gasses, &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into these carbon offset schemes have found. One, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, was even focused on one of Bezos’ grantees, the Nature Conservancy. Nevertheless, companies buy into them and claim that they’re canceling out their carbon footprint. EDF says that’s why funding their effort to vet these projects is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qiHVG"&gt;Several other grantees plan to focus their work on similar “nature-based solutions.” Separately, Amazon and other tech companies have funneled money into still-unproven technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; pledged $1 billion and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; committed $1 million a year to develop the technology. Until that technology is deployed at scale — and there are still questions over whether it’s too &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2021/01/direct-air-capture-definition-cost-considerations#:~:text=The%20range%20of%20costs%20for,the%20scale%20of%20their%20deployment."&gt;costly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100"&gt;energy intensive&lt;/a&gt; to do so — we won’t know whether those investments will succeed in permanently trapping and storing the carbon dioxide. In the meantime, the planet is continuing to heat up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="siSLQh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It reinforces practices that caused the crisis in the first place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MFHrW3"&gt;Groups like the Climate Justice Alliance, a cohort of organizations focused on tackling environmental racism, see these market-based solutions as a cop-out for corporate polluters. By funding these sorts of things, companies can say they’re tackling climate change. But if they aren’t weaning themselves off fossil fuels at the same time, they’re still contributing to the crisis and potentially delaying the transition to cleaner energy. “It reinforces practices that caused the crisis in the first place, perpetuating sacrifice zones and doing nothing to reduce emissions at the source,” CJA said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjbjsH"&gt;That’s why CJA wants to see more funding in the hands of grassroots groups that push companies to stop burning fossil fuels in the first place. They also want to stop pollution at the source because greenhouse gas emissions are usually accompanied by soot or other toxins. Capturing greenhouse gases alone doesn’t absolve companies like Amazon from the health threats posed by those other pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9f1i5"&gt;“No amount of greenwashing will absolve Jeff Bezos or Amazon of the harm they have inflicted on frontline communities and workers, or our planet,” CJA said. “If the Earth Fund wants to purport to save the planet, they should send funds directly to grassroots communities who are the least responsible and hardest hit by climate disaster and the kinds of rapacious business practices Bezos engages in.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8P9fMk"&gt;There’s another problem — people of color are &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6001?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=89531294&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xNvMHn1bWk9yKfonfI3tKRFqpBykQxjDPLwQQ8jOWV6x-lOYIn8RzUEdKwvI0RkzvF9opoWwdz4RPe8VAmXGxrue0heNyHVsPkDmeLZHAAcWSn38&amp;amp;utm_content=89531294&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; than white people to live in polluted areas. Both &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CJA_CWF-letter_2.2021.pdf"&gt;ClimateWorks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063352981"&gt;Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/a&gt; have also faced criticism for lacking diversity, because the people who are most affected by pollution aren’t getting a seat at the table. Both groups have made commitments to include environmental and racial justice in their work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmOjVu"&gt;“We know we can always do more to include the voices of groups working on the frontlines,” said Shawn Reifsteck, a vice president at ClimateWorks, in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUxUrW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;In December&lt;/a&gt;, the Climate Justice Alliance asked groups that received funding from Bezos to redirect 10 to 25 percent of those monies to a pooled fund. The fund would be governed by grassroots organizers from communities most impacted by pollution and climate change. CJA says “several” grantees have agreed to consider it. ClimateWorks says they’re in communication with CJA. But others might have their hands tied. EDF says that the funds it received from Bezos are restricted to its two projects on methane and nature-based solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXBRXo"&gt;“The reason that we ended up with those two projects is that Jeff [Bezos], when he first called us to talk about what he was up to, we talked about a range of things that are important — and these were a couple of the ideas that he had an interest in,” says EDF president Fred Krupp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bnq94u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos’ money has an outsized effect&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cZuA69"&gt;Because less than &lt;a href="https://www.climateworks.org/report/funding-trends-climate-change-mitigation-philanthropy/"&gt;2 percent&lt;/a&gt; of global philanthropy goes toward solving the climate crisis, Bezos’ money has an outsized effect. Very little of the existing philanthropy addresses environmental and racial inequities, according to ClimateWorks. So far, Bezos’ donations continue that practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBACNO"&gt;“By every measure, the Bezos Earth Fund’s $10 billion commitment is game-changing,” says ClimateWorks’ Reifsteck. Bezos hasn’t said how long it will take him to distribute the entire $10 billion. Still, that sum is ten times as much as foundations typically give in one year. And Bezos’ first round of funding did include some smaller grants to scrappier groups. That includes the NDN Collective, founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to support indigenous-led campaigns and sustainability initiatives, and the Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, launched in 2019 to raise money for women of color-led organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCkmMA"&gt;“The first round of grants from The Bezos Earth Fund included a total of $151 million in funding to five organizations with deep roots and expertise in environmental justice,” a representative of the Bezos Earth Fund said in an email. “The groups are using this money to make their own grants to hundreds of smaller-scale organizations doing critical climate justice work in communities across the U.S., and to build and scale their own infrastructure and impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XErP9G"&gt;Still, the Inland Empire, where Mendez lives, hasn’t seen anything “game-changing” since Bezos’ fund got off the ground. Instead, they’re grappling with more polluting infrastructure mushrooming across the region. For instance, Amazon plans to move into an &lt;a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2020/05/08/amazon-is-landing-at-san-bernardino-airport-officials-say/"&gt;air cargo logistics&lt;/a&gt; center. And even though their communities could use the funding, they worry about Bezos’ outsized influence. Will climate groups avoid pressuring Amazon in order to keep the Bezos donations coming? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pXEJPL"&gt;“If these organizations are receiving those dollars from the Earth Fund, are there going to be strings attached?” says Faraz Rizvi, a special projects coordinator working alongside Mendez at CCAEJ. “Overall, I remain kind of pessimistic about these funds being able to continue to hold Amazon accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4exiM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd9zj6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists want to know if vaccinated people can still become COVID-19 long-haulers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIYYsEjOmCv8PEmN76uHphWMcR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68768971/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RA0Z1g"&gt;Data from multiple COVID-19 vaccines makes it clear that the shots protect against the most severe outcomes of the disease: hospitalization and death. But it’s still unclear how well the vaccines will reduce the risk of chronic, long-term symptoms, which a small &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/14/21324201/covid-19-long-term-effects-symptoms-treatment"&gt;but significant&lt;/a&gt; number of COVID-19 patients experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDsm9"&gt;“It’s an incredibly important question that we just don’t know the answer to,” says Timothy Henrich, a virologist and viral immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco who is studying the &lt;a href="https://www.liincstudy.org/en/team"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V6rb7c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an incredibly important question that we just don’t know the answer to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUqYld"&gt;The various COVID-19 vaccines tested so far, including those made by Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, and Novavax, are all remarkably consistent in their near-perfect protection against hospitalization and death. These vaccines will be able to relieve pressure on health care systems and slow the overwhelming tally of COVID-19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S92Df3"&gt;But the vaccines aren’t perfect shields against getting sick with COVID-19. While they turned what may have been some severe cases of the disease into mild ones — a huge victory for public health — a handful of people in the clinical trials still got sick. In addition, it’s still not clear if the vaccines can block infection with the virus entirely or if they’re mainly able to make people asymptomatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGxRC"&gt;Scientists don’t know if a muted case of the disease in someone who has been vaccinated would be enough to trigger persistent symptoms. “I think it’s likely that they could,” says Priya Duggal, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, who’s also studying long-term symptoms of COVID-19. Many people who experience chronic symptoms didn’t get seriously sick during their initial infection. “They’re not necessarily hospitalized patients. A number are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the early phase,” Duggal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="quCEsO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many people who experience chronic symptoms didn’t get seriously sick during their initial infection&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FvyDH"&gt;Researchers still don’t have a good understanding of long-haulers overall. Their symptoms are diverse: some people may have altered taste or smell, while others could have consistent fevers and be short of breath for months. It’s also unclear what causes those symptoms to stick around after the acute phase of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOuPBZ"&gt;“There may be several different mechanisms that are going to be causing this to happen,” Henrich says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0W1dN"&gt;One theory is that long-haulers’ immune systems didn’t manage to wipe out the virus completely during their initial infection. Even though the person is no longer infectious, they may still have bits of virus or viral fragments lingering in their body, causing damage.  If that is the case, it’s possible that vaccination would prevent that from happening, says Aaron Ring, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine. “This is all hypothetical, but a vaccine, which can boost a very effective immune response, could promote more complete viral clearance,” he says. “In theory, if that was the mechanism, it could help prevent some of those symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gih9MC"&gt;If that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the mechanism, a vaccine might have less of a direct route to preventing those symptoms. Infection might provoke the immune system to attack the body, or the virus that does slip through could damage organs in a way that takes a long time to heal. If someone is vaccinated and still ends up with a mild case of disease, the virus could, in theory, still do that. “Would a vaccine interfere with that, or would a vaccine not interfere with that — that’s not known,” Duggal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy1p5g"&gt;Duggal and Heinrich are hoping to find answers on the relationship between vaccination and long-haulers through their research on COVID-19 patients. Duggal is running a survey of 25,000 people who’ve had the disease, and it includes a question asking if they’ve been vaccinated or are participating in a vaccine trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvaeTu"&gt;Heinrich and his team are following people with persistent symptoms over time. “We’re looking for people who have been vaccinated and also become infected,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXzEsp"&gt;Duggal isn’t sure vaccines will reduce the risk for persistent symptoms entirely. “I think there is going to be a small percentage of people that could get infected even post-vaccination that could become long-haulers,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aubrc8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not likely that vaccination, by converting severe cases of COVID-19 to mild cases, will create &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;long-haulers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVklqc"&gt;To be clear, it’s not likely that vaccination, by converting severe cases of COVID-19 to mild cases, will create &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;long-haulers, says Jessica Dine, a pulmonary specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “That’s not what we typically observe with other vaccines,” she says. “With the flu shot, you can still get the flu, even though you’ll get a milder case. But we don’t see an increase in stuff like post-viral inflammation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qGXyJ"&gt;Dine’s best guess is that we’ll see fewer people with long-term symptoms as more people get vaccinated. Right now, the percentage of people who get COVID-19 and end up with long-term symptoms is fairly high — some estimates put it around &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21523448/covid-long-term-effects-symptoms-damage"&gt;10 percent, with others going higher.&lt;/a&gt; Duggal also hopes vaccination could cut that number down. “If people are vaccinated, can we drop that number to one to five percent? Can we get it lower? I’m hoping that’s what it is,” she says. “I just don’t know, but I’m hoping it’ll be fewer people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffbu9d"&gt;In the meantime, the researchers stress that there’s a clear way vaccines will reduce the number of long-haulers: by driving down the number of infections in the population overall. “As more people get vaccinated, there’s less virus circulating,” Duggal says. That means fewer people getting sick, which leads to fewer people experiencing long-term symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbbJee"&gt;“If we’re going to ever try to reach this mountain of herd immunity, people have to get vaccinated,” she says. “If we can do that, we’re also protecting ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
