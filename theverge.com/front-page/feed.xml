    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the site wasn’t working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1383552847120257024"&gt;as recently as mid-April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQoHaS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmT7cS"&gt;There is a live page for the game on Pac-Man’s &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, which says &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; is “coming soon” and lists Bandai Namco as the developer and Amazon Games as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrXLN"&gt;There’s also a live Twitter account, @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpacmanlive?lang=en"&gt;PlayPacManLive&lt;/a&gt;, that has only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1263642826018971651"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1280317322842931201"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290349893421211648"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350207553564672"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350895025143809"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297"&gt;from August 16th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; (in reply to a tweet from an account that no longer exists) saying that “we’re getting closer to having all the pellets in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A3DCbe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're getting closer to having all the pellets in place, and coffee breaks activated. We greatly appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— PAC-MAN LIVE STUDIO (@PlayPacManLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewPnZ2"&gt;When I reached out about the game’s status, Amazon said it forwarded my inquiry about the status of the game to Bandai Namco, which hasn’t responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ExYxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; could indicate yet another example of an Amazon-backed game failing to materialize. Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt; but was put back into closed beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; and eventually canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online roleplaying game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; after a contract dispute with Tencent. (Amazon is still working on its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-will-cost-at-least-465-million.html"&gt;extremely expensive &lt;em&gt;Lord of Rings&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHQ9wH"&gt;And open-world MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ current marquee title (and, I should add, the only one listed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games"&gt;the Games section&lt;/a&gt; of the studio’s website), was delayed for the third time from a spring 2021 release to August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRqMbI"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; never comes out, it could also indicate that Amazon is scaling back potential ambitions to offer playable games on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just supposed to let you play the classic &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; mazes you’re familiar with — it’s also set to offer co-op with up to four players and let you create and share your own mazes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="OndETz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10505115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgW81Q"&gt;Of course, many games have been delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear that’s what is happening here, particularly because both Amazon and Bandai Namco have been so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFEtr"&gt;Despite Amazon Games’ many recent cancellations, the company recently reiterated support for game development. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt; describing problems at the studio, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;also reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating the company’s continued commitment to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJBEn"&gt;“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy reportedly wrote. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA chief Bill Nelson talks rockets, Moon plans, and partnerships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7VFcZThhQKAEExmGmPg5Mj5osw=/0x0:4496x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300922/_MG_3485.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Nelson on his first few days on the job: ‘I’m drinking from a firehose’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="55j0ie"&gt;As a politician, space was Bill Nelson’s thing. He started out as a state lawmaker near Florida’s Space Coast, ascended to Congress in 1978, then became the House’s first sitting member to actually go to space in 1986, flying as a payload specialist aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. He’d spend three terms in the Senate shaping NASA’s budget and helping steer, from the policy side, NASA’s plans to return to the Moon, before losing a reelection bid in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpl4ln"&gt;Now, he’s on the other side, leading the agency he oversaw for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Q06W"&gt;Sworn in as NASA’s 14th administrator on May 3rd, Nelson helms the space agency at a pivotal moment, with a lot already on his plate. He’s tasked with putting astronauts back on the Moon, sustaining a growing bloc of international partners, shaping the fate of the 20-year-old International Space Station, and boosting NASA’s Earth Sciences wing to play a larger role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1N5pN"&gt;Like his predecessor, congressman-turned-NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Nelson wants to leverage his Senate experience to return humans to the Moon by 2024, a deadline set by the Trump administration. President Biden’s transition team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;scoffed&lt;/a&gt; at the 2024 goal as unrealistic, but Nelson is embracing it in a measured approach, holding off on ditching it while acknowledging a moonshot is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FeQzt7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feud over NASA’s Moon lander award presents the first test of Nelson’s Senate ties&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WuzAB"&gt;He already faces some challenges. Last year, Congress gave NASA only a quarter of what it requested to fund its first ride to the Moon since 1972. The agency, hamstrung by a tight budget, ditched a plan to pick two companies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $3 billion contract to tailor its budding Starship rocket for two initial test flights to the lunar surface, including the first astronaut landing in 2024. That spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;wave of opposition from the two losing companies&lt;/a&gt; that were also in the running for the contract, as well as pushback from Nelson’s old buddies in the Senate. They’re calling on NASA to reopen the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mft6ej"&gt;On Friday, May 14th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; sat down with Nelson, virtually, to chat about his new duties as NASA administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePb0s9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZTrNH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you enjoying your new gig at NASA? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzB1T3"&gt;I’m drinking from a firehose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wbIQD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ha, what’s that like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9qr9D"&gt;It’s like trying to take sips of water with an avalanche of water coming at you. [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] I’m having a ball, is the true statement. Of course, this is a subject matter that I have had some experience in and I’m passionate about. It’s just a great privilege for me to have been nominated and confirmed for this job. So we got a lot going on this year, and you’ll be seeing these things unfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fjXoJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like your first big test is this Human Landing System dilemma we’re seeing unfold, with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bid protests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Maria Cantwell’s amendment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; aiming to reopen the competition that SpaceX won. Have you put your Senate experience to use and talked to your Senate buddies about this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RBo5oP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress has got to do its part”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOYs1L"&gt;So. I’ve been having a lot of conversations with senators, congressmen, and particularly their staff, and White House staff as well. This is about the budget, and I’ve been making the case that we need vigorous competition going forward on the Human Landing System. And of course, everything’s frozen up until the first of August, with the protest of the SpaceX award. Depending on how that goes, either way, we’re going to need the competition. Maria Cantwell, at my confirmation hearing, was talking about that. And of course, I assured her that competition is good, and you get greater efficiencies and greater performance out of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odERqS"&gt;But Congress has got to do its part. And that is to prepare, plan for, and provide the money so we can have a vigorous competition and have more than one awardee. In last year’s budget, NASA had requested $3.4 billion for this competition, and Congress came up with $850 million. You just can’t do the competition with that kind of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMfmXw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the protest litigation pending, and without much funding, it’s unclear if NASA can simply add another company to work alongside SpaceX. But with this 2024 goal in mind, do you think quickly reopening the HLS competition to add another company, alongside SpaceX, should be the way to go? Or should those other companies wait to take advantage of future competitions?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUUYSh"&gt;Well, if SpaceX’s award is not overturned, and you continue as a result of the Government Accountability Office saying that SpaceX is the winner, then what you have to do is look at all these follow-on contracts. SpaceX’s award is for only a demonstration flight that would land humans and return them to Earth safely. Then you get into the use contracts — and there’ll be many of them — and that’s what the competition will be for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KApUg"&gt;If the bid protest is successful, then you have to start the original competition over again, and that’s where Congress hopefully will provide the resources in which to do a vigorous competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWXmBq"&gt;The SpaceX award says they can land on the Moon in 2024. Of course, we know that space is hard, that because of developing technology and the unique environment of space and so forth, history often tells us that you get delays. But 2024 is the schedule as outlined in the award, and that’s what we’re planning for — at the same time recognizing the sobering reality that space is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-nominee for NASA administrator Bill Nelson bumps elbows with Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate commerce committee that oversees NASA, after his confirmation hearing on April 21st, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mZHyW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about NASA’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338638/nasa-space-launch-system-hot-fire-test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Launch System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;How do you view the future of SLS? What role should SLS play long-term in NASA’s vision for the Moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bWCGE"&gt;Remember the context, that SLS was conceived when we passed that NASA bill 11 years ago that set NASA on the dual course mandate. The commercial course, and then the other course, was to get NASA out of low-Earth orbit and go explore beyond LEO. It was felt at the time that we needed to get going, and we saw the opportunities under the advice of NASA to take a lot of the technologies that had been developing for the Space Shuttle, enhance them, and utilize them into what is today the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49t9g"&gt;The SLS, as we speak, is being stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building at [Kennedy Space Center]. So I think there’s going to be a vigorous future for the SLS, and it will take our astronauts into the vicinity of the Moon, into what is called a cislunar orbit. So yes, there will be a lot of activity with the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJh70e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some folks in the space community who criticize the SLS program as being a kind of jobs program and that, despite the rocket’s proven shuttle hardware, the cost and design of commercial rockets have evolved significantly since Congress initiated that dual course objective. Would you agree with that at all? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Nyp7"&gt;Remember, space is hard. And the SLS is getting ready to fly. The others that were the ones in the competition, none of those have flown. So you have to build step by step. So put it in context as you’re evaluating that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuGUEe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On climate and Earth sciences — the Biden administration has vowed to boost the country’s edge in tackling climate change. What kind of new investments and programs are we going to see for climate science and green aviation in NASA’s budget request coming up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaEkRt"&gt;As I said at my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395950/bill-nelson-backs-nasas-moon-plans-climate-change-work-in-confirmation-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to mitigate climate change, you have to measure it. And who does that? That’s NASA that builds the spacecraft. So take, for example, we’re going to be putting up Landsat 9, and this is after 50 years of Landsat in partnership with the [United States Geological Survey]. NASA provides repetitive imaging and it shows, over that half-century, what’s happening in the human interaction with the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHP3p1"&gt;I could clearly see that 36 years ago with the naked eye from the window of a spacecraft. I could see, for example, going across the southern tip of Africa and out over the Indian Ocean. And lo and behold, there’s the island nation of Madagascar, and they had cut down all the trees on Madagascar. And when the rains came, there was no vegetation to hold the topsoil. The topsoil went down the rivers, and you could clearly see that from space. All the mouths of the rivers had discolored significantly that bright blue color of the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgcEvX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to switch to international partnerships. As a senator, you sometimes took tough stances on Russia. You frequently called them out in 2018 for their hacking of Florida elections systems. Now you’re at NASA, where Russia is one of its biggest partners in space. Will you have to switch your views a bit with regard to Russia, and what future do you see for NASA’s partnership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AODUKp"&gt;Russia has been our partner ever since the ice was broken in the middle of the Cold War in 1975, with Apollo-Soyuz. We have built the International Space Station with them. I believe that, as long as we’re involved in the space station, Russia will continue to be our partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WAsbNF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I see a continuing, close cooperation” with Russia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDp6lE"&gt;You probably know that I want to expand the life of the station to 2023, and the idea would eventually be that you let private industry build the space station thereafter. And NASA could concentrate on the continuing exploration of the cosmos. But I see a continuing close cooperation. Regardless of the statements that you hear coming from time to time that would indicate otherwise, I just think, at the end of the day, Russia’s going to continue to be our partner. I think we have to watch the things like Russia and China saying that they’re going to cooperate on landing on the Moon, but it’s a big difference saying that than doing it. So I want to continue the partnership with the Russians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgygrg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on partnering with China? Through the Wolf Amendment, NASA is largely barred from partnering with China. Many former NASA officials have supported the idea of working more with China, as they &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;court NASA allies like Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And Pam Melroy, your incoming deputy, last year was &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/biden-china-space-448529"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quoted by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as saying that trying to exclude China “is a failing strategy.” Do you agree with her on that, and should NASA engage with China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8ed2Z"&gt;Well, it is the law. And until the law is changed, we’re going to adhere to the law. There are obvious things that, regardless of the law, you can still cooperate with China on. For example, if China is successful in landing a lander today on Mars, there are things that we can share. [Editor’s Note: a few hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;it landed successfully&lt;/a&gt;.] Going forward in the future, there are things that we need to share with China, such as the avoidance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt;. So there are many, many things like that where you can really have a cooperative relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blTFyg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the state of growing Russia-China relations right now, do you think that law, the Wolf Amendment, should be changed? Or would you make any effort to change the Wolf Amendment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyeH8z"&gt;Give me a while to be in the saddle, and then I’ll answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svgDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for chatting, Bill. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants you to know it chose not to take a cut of $400 billion in physical goods </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller stock 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRuNIiR8ZxOfS5m6Tc5J9TCzqA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300846/verge-2015-09-09_12-31-45.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS15t"&gt;Apple is trying to convince a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; milking the App Store for all it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;, and today the company dropped some big numbers to help make its case. Apple claims that its App Store drove $400 billion worth of physical purchases in a single year in 2019, and that — unlike digital purchases and subscriptions — Apple doesn’t take a cent of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMyZWo"&gt;That’s according to App Store boss and longtime Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller, who also testified that the company spends a staggering $50 million a year to throw its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. The company’s also building a new developer center at its Apple Loop headquarters in Cupertino, he says, though I didn’t catch how much the company’s investing in that. None of these are included in the App Store’s budget, Schiller testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok6hdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller says in 2019 App Store drove $400 billion+ in transactions of physical goods, so food delivery, Amazon, Uber/Lyft, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge interjects. “Billion with a b?” It’s a big number, and Schiller confirms Apple doesn’t take a cut of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Statt (@nickstatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394363213932863488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kScH5F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller’s going over the explanation Apple has given before for why it doesn’t take a commission on physical goods: it can’t guarantee they actually arrive. (This logic goes for things like Lyft/Uber as well, per earlier discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394362691859492869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6t7Er"&gt;Why isn’t Apple trying to take a cut of physical purchases? During his testimony, Schiller explained that Apple couldn’t guarantee they would actually arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1N9L"&gt;But I also imagine it might have been a hard sell with developers: can Apple really argue that it drove those $400 billion in purchases by itself? If I’m going to buy something online, I’ll probably start by whipping out my phone, but I’ve got a laptop with a perfectly good web browser right here to buy those same items, if an app doesn’t immediately do the job. Amazon knows this, and used it to bypass Apple’s digital cut on movies and shows, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;until it got a better deal&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"&gt;Digital books are a different matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GwhEyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Read Steve Jobs’ emails about why you can’t buy digital books in Amazon’s apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"},{"title":"Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax, and why other developers won’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j1bzfO"&gt;Even without a cut of physical purchases, Apple’s App Store cut is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to rake in $64 billion for the company each year&lt;/a&gt;, with profit margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;approaching a ludicrous 78 percent&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXfgHH"&gt;Schiller testified that 84 percent of all App Store apps are completely free, with roughly 75 percent of all games on the App Store completely free. Of those games, approximately 17 percent are freemium (requiring in-app purchases to unlock content) and 6 percent are paid, leaving just 2 percent on a subscription model if we do the math.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ latest Quest update brings mixed reality capture that only requires an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Live Overlay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx2j4P7bOpiv5Rz3lbJiNRL73EQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300645/oculusliveoverlay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO5Lxs"&gt;Oculus will soon roll out its v29 software for Quest and Quest 2 headsets, and this one adds more features and functionality to the lineup. The most exciting one is a new Live Overlay casting feature that will give you an easy way to capture a mixed reality view of you using VR superimposed over the content displayed in your headset. Any VR app that supports casting and recording will work with this feature, according to Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUoflT"&gt;All you’ll need is at least an iPhone XS or newer, a Quest headset, and the Oculus app for iOS updated to a new version that’s coming to “a subset of users.” Then you turn on the feature and have someone aim the camera at you (or aim it at yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQWF1"&gt;There are other highlights to mention in this software version, but I want to focus a moment longer on how big of a technical achievement Live Overlay seems to be. The company’s previous solution, its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYxJnvyqtg"&gt;Mixed Reality Capture Tool&lt;/a&gt; on PC for Quest and Rift S, required a bunch of expensive hardware, including a rig with 16GB of RAM, a decent graphics card, your own 1080p webcam, a 5GHz Wi-Fi router, and — of course — your own green screen. But for lucky iOS users who get the app update, Oculus’ improved feature has eliminated the need for almost all of those gadgets. You just need your headset and your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X239Dy"&gt;In other casting news, Oculus is allowing you to capture what you’re saying into your headset’s built-in microphone during casting sessions or when you’re recording a video clip. It’s also extending multi-user support and the app sharing feature to owners of the original Quest, so multiple people can share games on a single headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289577/facebook-rolling-out-multi-user-support-oculus-quest-2"&gt;These features were originally limited to the Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, but Oculus is making good on its pledge to bring them to the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus files app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IepGoo1U9sDFI_bY0nFAkTrx9lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520891/oculusfilemanager.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4REj2I"&gt;There’s a Files app coming with this update, and it’ll be located within your app library. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsee-yourself-in-vr-with-live-overlay-plus-new-infinite-office-features-and-more-in-latest-oculus-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus says in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll be able to download and upload media files “to and from your favorite websites” through the browser built into the headset. In other words, it should be a lot easier to upload content to social media sites other than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LvsE"&gt;The last couple of additions include an Infinite Office update that lets iOS users (using an iPhone 7 and newer, with Android support coming soon) see lock screen notifications from within a Quest headset. Oculus is also adding a shortcut for its Passthrough command to the user interface in the Quick Settings menu, giving you an alternative method of triggering it instead of physically double-tapping the side of your headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SmwFs"&gt;Lastly, Oculus will begin showing ads for VR experiences within the mobile app with the intent to broaden discovery for both developers looking for an audience and users to find new content. This could be useful for smaller developers who have built quality experiences but don’t have the awareness of more popular apps. That said, if you’re a curious Quest owner looking for new experiences, I suggest checking out SideQuest on PC or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22395923/sidequest-android-app-sideload-oculus-quest-2-virtual-reality-apps-games-experiences"&gt;from an Android phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot suspends Valorant pro six months for failing to cooperate in sexual assault investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sinatraa" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSoToUrFq1LGJatejpLgJ-SRhcQ=/58x0:901x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300572/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Robert Paul / Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuUrNP"&gt;Professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; player Jay “Sinatraa” Won has been suspended for six months by Riot Games for “failing to fully cooperate” with an ongoing investigation into an allegation of sexual assault. The investigation stems from an allegation dating back to March of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323695/jay-sinatraa-won-valorant-suspended-sexual-assault-allegations"&gt;when Won was accused of sexual abuse by a former girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by recordings and screenshots of messages. At the time, Won was indefinitely suspended by both Riot, which develops &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; and organizes most online competitions, and Sentinels, the team for which he plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiRFvI"&gt;According to Riot, this latest suspension is related to Won’s behavior during the investigation. &lt;a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/esports/competitive-ruling-jay-sinatraa-won/"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, the company said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pJbvGR"&gt;The competitive operations team had serious concerns with Sinatraa’s conduct during the course of the investigation. It was determined that on at least two occasions Sinatraa misrepresented certain facts, made false statements, and did not cooperate with the investigation in a way expected of a professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; esports player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qenib"&gt;Of note, Sinatraa’s public commitment on social media to provide the full audio and video clip referenced in the original post was never fulfilled. Cooperation in these investigations is of the utmost importance, especially when the nature of the allegations is as serious as sexual assault. This behavior will not be tolerated by &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Esports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KU4bnr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;Won began competing in &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; but rose to prominence in the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, where he was named MVP in 2019 — though &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1369827584955977729"&gt;OWL began offering refunds&lt;/a&gt; on his in-game MVP skin following the allegations in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVYV5q"&gt;Following Riot’s decision today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sinatraa/status/1394384776476381184"&gt;Won released a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; saying that “I’ve spent the last two months reflecting on how I can be better as a person.” With regards to the investigation, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfIS9X"&gt;I want to preface this by saying I do not have the video / audio that she used in her statement. After our relationship ended she had asked me to delete the video and I honored that. I’ve never even imagined a situation like this so when it all happened I didn’t know whether to just spill out my side or not. I had no clue what to do so I seeked &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; legal help immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXJW3q"&gt;As we were drafting up an update with the legal PR team we had added that I would provide the video because we genuinely thought that the video would have to be shared in full since it’s a key part in the investigation. However that did not happen and I should not have promised something I could not personally deliver. This entire experience has been humbling and an opportunity for me to come out the other side a better person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt6Nt2"&gt;As for the initial allegation of sexual assault, Riot said that because the matter has been referred to law enforcement, “at this juncture we will defer to the authorities to make further investigation into and factual findings related to the allegations.” Riot added that “to the extent that additional material information comes to light, from law enforcement or otherwise, the competitive operations team reserves the right to reopen the investigation and take further appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZ9DFu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 17th, 4:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with a statement from Won.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s WorkingWell will attempt to fix employee health issues with stretching and guided meditation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhc97lakaEwo0NYIBBtSrPPQhsk=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300419/Health___Saftey_Huddles__2_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W9pC5t"&gt;Amazon is launching &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/body-mechanics-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed"&gt;a new series of health programs&lt;/a&gt; called WorkingWell designed to prevent workplace injuries in the company’s expansive system of warehouses and distribution centers in the US. While the new health program is an attempt to address the 40 percent of work-related injuries Amazon has identified as musculoskeletal disorders (think carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain), it doesn’t come with any changes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;the long shifts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493752/amazon-warehouses-robots-higher-injury-rates-report-reveal"&gt;demanding working conditions&lt;/a&gt; that might cause them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxQvKK"&gt;As part of WorkingWell, workers will have dedicated meetings to watch videos covering health and safety topics, and designated spaces for stretching and meditating at work. Depending on the station and job, some workers will also receive timed video prompts to guide them through stretching and mental wellness exercises (Amazon calls these “Mind and Body Moments”). Amazon also plans to stock more healthy snacks in break rooms to round out the health-focused lifestyle it’s trying to promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETOKx9"&gt;Outside of the warehouse, Amazon says it’ll offer “Neighborhood Wellness Centers” for some of employees’ primary care needs — covering everything from filling prescriptions and offering vaccines, to ongoing care like physical therapy. Because this is a tech company trying to tackle “health,” there’s also a mobile app that will collect all of Amazon’s educational videos and guided AmaZen meditations (yes, that’s the name) for employees to use at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctQAO0"&gt;In March, Amazon was criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331502/amazon-warehouse-gamification-program-expand-fc-games"&gt;for how it uses gamification&lt;/a&gt; to increase employee performance, and it’s hard to not see WorkingWell as an extension of that kind of thinking. It arrives after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385762/bezos-letter-shareholders-amazon-workers-union-bessemer-workplace"&gt;Jeff Bezos told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; the company needs to “do a better job for our employees,” but it seems to help make the case that the kinds of structural changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;the various Amazon unions&lt;/a&gt; are trying to win are far better than anything the company is willing to freely offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYrRtk"&gt;Amazon plans to offer WorkingWell in all of its US operations network by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia CEO reportedly negotiating departure after being left out of AT&amp;T–Discovery deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hulu LLC CEO Jason Kilar News Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvwdbmt3R-BsyxlN6KFbs_R2jxY=/0x84:3000x2084/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300401/123197464.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PwyTd"&gt;WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who was appointed to the role &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203135/warnermedia-hulu-jason-kilar-ceo-john-stankey-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-wars-netflix-disney"&gt;in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is negotiating his departure from the company following AT&amp;amp;T’s announcement that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;merging WarnerMedia with Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/business/jason-kilar-warnermedia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Kilar was “kept in the dark about the deal until recent days,” sources told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AztT9k"&gt;Kilar has been overseeing all of WarnerMedia, including Warner Bros., Turner, and HBO. But it was unclear how he would slot into the new company given that Discovery’s president and CEO David Zaslav &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html"&gt;is set to head it up&lt;/a&gt;. Kilar joined AT&amp;amp;T just a month before HBO Max launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and he orchestrated a major reorganization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; that gave HBO Max even more of a priority at the company. He previously ran Hulu from 2007 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2I1275"&gt;Although he’s reportedly working his way out, Kilar sent a “rallying-the-troops” memo to WarnerMedia, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6Y2GM"&gt;The tie-up between WarnerMedia and Discovery isn’t expected to close until mid-2022, so there’s still some time left before Zaslav takes over. On a call this morning, Zaslav described Kilar as a “fantastic talent” when asked about his future. John Stankey, the CEO of AT&amp;amp;T, suggested the decision would be up to Zaslav. “David’s got a lot of decisions to make on personnel and how things are structured moving forward during this transition period,” he said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8i5vH"&gt;WarnerMedia didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unannounced Beats Studio Buds appear in Apple’s latest beta software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZn4KWrHQuA-cJuq6ZJjQ6McE0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300318/DSCF5800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVUMMi"&gt;Aside from churning out some limited edition colors, Beats has been in a bit of a quiet period since the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;the Beats Flex last October&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the Apple-owned brand is preparing to launch some new, high-end earbuds. As spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of “Beats Studio Buds” in the latest beta releases of iOS and tvOS. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/exclusive-these-are-apples-new-truly-wireless-in-ear-beats-studio-earbuds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also uncovered images of the charging case and some system animations of the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0cddl"&gt;The unannounced earbuds look much different than the Powerbeats Pro, which have become a popular pick among the fitness crowd. These don’t have any ear hooks whatsoever, and they seem to have a diagonal steam that extends slightly upward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRM2SAivqimLhJi-GGG5tQc_CXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520853/beats.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwUzHB"&gt;These images being included in “release candidate” builds of Apple’s software could mean that the Beats Studio Buds are due to be announced in the near future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Beats for comment. According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, the code pertaining to the earbuds confirms they’ll have noise cancellation, which is something that all Beats earbuds currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnnNfQ"&gt;Apple is also expected to update its main AirPods earbuds sometime this year with a revamped design featuring shortened stems and other aesthetic details borrowed from the AirPods Pro. But they’re likely to retain the hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit. Beats, however, seems to be sticking with silicone tips for an in-ear seal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GisLML"&gt;Beats has been going through a transition period after former president Luke Wood departed Apple last year. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/14/apple-beats-isnt-dead-yet-with-new-designer-reportedly-designing-new-products"&gt;Recently, it’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Scott Croyle, formerly of HTC, is playing a significant role in Beats hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine waivers alone can’t solve India’s vaccine crisis  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Covid-19 Disaster Reaches Deep Into Indian Towns And Villages" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYPOsTsLreB8idhUuRwdI3XBWWI=/0x0:7941x5294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300154/1318463734.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But they might help&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ocULQX"&gt;India never should have been in this position. The government is currently engaged in international disputes over vaccine waivers and intellectual property rights, while a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/india-covid-crisis-who-says-it-accounts-for-50percent-of-reported-cases-last-week.html"&gt;horrific and record-setting surge of COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt; continues to devastate its population. The country’s recent vaccine policies — opening vaccination for all above the age of 18 while reeling under severe shortage, allowing the private sectors to sell the vaccine at market prices, and leaving the states to procure vaccines themselves — have been strongly criticized by &lt;a href="https://www.article-14.com/post/covid-19-vaccines-not-a-luxury-former-health-secy-criticises-modi-govt-policy"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; experts and its &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/supreme-court-directs-centre-to-revisit-current-vaccine-policy-says-it-may-create-disparity/articleshow/82366043.cms"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2A2YX"&gt;It’s a bizarre predicament for one of the largest suppliers of vaccines in the world, a country that was ideally positioned to quickly ramp up vaccine manufacturing. But while some nations invested in domestic development of vaccines and others secured supplies from manufacturers, India showed no &lt;a href="https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/what-gone-wrong-india-s-vaccination-programme"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to increase its vaccine-manufacturing capacity. Instead, it prematurely declared a victory over the virus and grossly underestimated the quantity of vaccines it would need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHbV0w"&gt;“We are basically suffering the adverse consequences of the poor policy actions of last year,” said R. Ramakumar, an economist and professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai who writes on issues related to access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0igdZ"&gt;India scored a small victory on May 5th, when the US announced its support for an intellectual property rights waiver on vaccines and agreed to participate in its negotiations. But while many celebrated the decision, others were circumspect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NfREbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are basically suffering the adverse consequences of the poor policy actions of last year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RW48rB"&gt;“I was surprised [at the decision] but then I read the fine print,” Ramakumar said. He said by the language of its &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/may/statement-ambassador-katherine-tai-covid-19-trips-waiver"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the US seemed to be in no hurry to waive intellectual rights, anticipating negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be hard and long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpH60O"&gt;That lack of urgency is something that vaccine-hungry countries like India can ill afford. India is looking to vaccinate over 900 million adults, but it has only managed to fully vaccinate just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/#global"&gt;2.8 percent of the population&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sI4Bth"&gt;Waiving intellectual property rights could give vaccine manufacturers the information they need to ramp up vaccine production so that more people in the world get their jabs. However, some experts like Ramakumar believe it will take months for the international community to reach consensus, and other experts believe that waivers alone won’t help — not without adequate infrastructure and support to make the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M5L5kA"&gt;India’s proposal to waive COVID-19 patents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="clTqtm"&gt;For months, as COVID-19 cases and death tolls rose, the world hoped that the introduction of vaccines would bring the pandemic to an end. This didn’t happen. Out of the approximately 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines administered, only 0.3 percent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/opinion/who-covid-vaccines.html"&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; to low-income countries. Many rich Western countries like the US bought enough vaccines to inoculate their population many times over while countries like &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/vaccine-deserts-some-countries-have-no-covid-19-jabs-at-all/articleshow/82494691.cms"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, in sub-Saharan Africa, had none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgFcpC"&gt;In October 2020, India and South Africa &lt;a href="https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/IP/C/W669.pdf&amp;amp;Open=True"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; a temporary waiver of intellectual property and patent rights over products that could prevent, contain, and treat COVID-19. This would ensure that COVID-19 vaccines and drugs could be manufactured in facilities across the world — and not just in a small number of factories that hold coveted licenses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNXcT"&gt;First, the WTO would have to agree to waive intellectual property rights currently protected under an agreement called the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (&lt;a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm"&gt;TRIPS&lt;/a&gt;). There are provisions in the agreement — called TRIPS flexibilities — that could allow countries to waive patent rights to ensure access to essential medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="COVID-19 Vaccination Drive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-Z9zb4bNdsWtRSoCe8LoDVob4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520567/1232946348.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A vaccine site in New Delhi, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BphhFd"&gt;The waiver proposed by India and South Africa goes beyond the TRIPS flexibilities and asks pharmaceutical companies to hand over copyright material, trade secrets and data submitted to regulatory authorities. This is because vaccine manufacturing is complex. Without this additional technical information it won’t be possible for other manufacturers to produce vaccines quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2aNmn"&gt;India and South Africa’s proposal was backed by over 100 developing countries but was initially opposed by the US, UK, Canada, EU and other western countries who claimed that the intellectual property system was required to incentivize new inventions of vaccines, diagnostics and treatment. At one point, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, billionaire philanthropist argued the same,&lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/gates-foundation-reverses-course-on-covid-19-vaccine-patents-99810"&gt; claiming&lt;/a&gt; that intellectual property rights underpin innovation and waiving the laws will not make vaccines accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWjwT9"&gt;After the US stated support for IP waivers, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/gates-foundation-reverses-course-on-covid-19-vaccine-patents-99810"&gt; changed&lt;/a&gt; its position. The US’ decision also convinced the EU, France, Ireland and UK to agree to participate in the WTO negotiations. However Germany remains opposed to the idea of a waiver, and the WTO requires all 164 member countries to come to a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv2QPI"&gt;“We are expecting countries led by big pharma to use delay tactics even before negotiations begin,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia head of Access Campaign, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders). She also added that the world needs more than COVID-19 vaccines. It also needs more COVID-19 drugs and treatments, but the US does not currently support waivers for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP199c"&gt;Considering it took the WTO five years to negotiate the 2001 Doha declaration — which only clarified TRIPS flexibilities — the fight over the current waiver is likely to be fierce, and enduring. “If the world does what it did for HIV/AIDS, it would take 20 years before COVID-19 treatment and vaccines reach those who need them,” Menghaney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wKTJSf"&gt;Can India move ahead without vaccine waivers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mSXBDd"&gt;India doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to wait for a WTO agreement to move ahead. Through something called compulsory licensing it could allow generic manufacturers to produce a patented drug without the license owner’s consent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCjrML"&gt;“Even without WTO approval, India can issue a compulsory license for Covishield so that other Indian manufacturers can produce it”, said Mengahney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqrGL2"&gt;Covishield is what the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is known as in India. Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca gave permission to the Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce the vaccine. SII is the &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/serum-institute-of-india-obtains-emergency-use-authorisation-in-india-for-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world&lt;/a&gt;, and can produce 70 million doses of the vaccine per month. But India needs at least 170 million doses monthly in order to&lt;a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/covid-19-vaccine-data-analysis-at-current-rate-of-2-2mn-doses-per-day-india-can-only-cover-30-population-by-end-2021-9562811.html"&gt; vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; 80% of the country by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="India Starts World’s Largest Vaccination Against COVID-19" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbzlDM6D3vLC5g3BK1lOK7j9cro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520346/1230620964.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A vaccinator holds a vial of Serum Institute of India’s (SII) COVID-19 vaccine called “Covishield.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UNO6cH"&gt;While it may be possible for India to override the intellectual property rights, essentially bypassing the pharma companies and granting other factories permission to manufacture vaccines, it is unlikely to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XqrnX"&gt;For vaccines, compulsory licensing can be tricky. Lifting patents does not give the manufacturers all they need to know to produce the vaccines, “There needs to be a transfer of technology and know-how, along with the lifting of patent rights,” said Ramakumar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlLp7w"&gt;Along with legal rights, a technology transfer, where companies help provide technical support to the companies receiving the technology, is required. This is why countries, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-seeks-mrna-tech-transfer-amid-covid-19-vaccine-supply-issues-2021-05-11/"&gt;including Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, have been prodding pharmaceutical companies to collaborate and issue more voluntary licenses — like the one already issued by AstraZeneca to SII. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QEnjy"&gt;Even when there is support, vaccine production takes time. India’s indigenously produced Covaxin vaccine has been licensed to three public sector vaccine manufacturers in India, but production still hasn’t started yet and will take another three to six months to get going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5aaFP"&gt;Some vaccines are also more complex to produce than others. mRNA vaccines, like the ones developed by Pfizer and Moderna, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html"&gt;are newcomers&lt;/a&gt; to the pharmaceutical world. There are already global shortages of raw materials for mRNA vaccines, including everything from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-world-is-hungry-for-mrna-covid-vaccines-like-pfizers-but-were-short-of-vital-components-159143"&gt;plastic bags to nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG4WSU"&gt;That’s because before the pandemic, these kinds of vaccines were mostly produced in tiny batches — enough for academic research but not a global vaccination campaign. The newness of these vaccines also means that manufacturing facilities and expertise needed to safely make these vaccines are in extremely short supply. Those problems aren’t something that a waiver alone can solve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="b1iqV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There needs to be a transfer of technology and know-how, along with the lifting of patent rights.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3L0BH"&gt;“It takes a significant amount of time, a couple of months, for vaccine manufacturers to put in place infrastructure, raw materials, skilled workers and arrangements with vendors to start making the vaccines,” said Shivangi Mittal, senior associate at Koan Advisory Group, a technology policy consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LcvfZ"&gt;This process will be slower for intellectual property from other countries or from other innovators who are not closely working with manufacturers under existing commercial arrangements, said Mittal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHOiok"&gt;Beyond the technical issues, there are diplomatic repercussions to going it alone. Any country that has used compulsory licensing in the past has attracted severe censure from regions that are pharma hubs, such as the European Union, US,  and Japan, which have responded with threats of sanctions and cutting off of trade privileges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTMl4C"&gt;“While this [overriding of patent rights] is legally possible, it has rarely been used, even in strong developing countries like India or Brazil or South Africa,” said Achal Prabhala, coordinator of the AccessIBSA project, which campaigns for access to medicines in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz6n7v"&gt;Prabhala said that smaller developing countries have almost never used these provisions because they are even more vulnerable to diplomatic pressure from economic heavyweights like the US and EU. That’s why waivers remain a slower but still more diplomatically palatable option for most countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc5d9h"&gt;Waivers are a start. They can theoretically help increase vaccine supplies, but to actually get shots into the arms of people, India’s government will still need to enact good policies to help manufacture and distribute vaccines. Globally, it would mean more collaborations and technology transfers from Western to non-Western pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3R74rz"&gt;“For India, that would mean declaring vaccines as public good, procuring them centrally and providing them free,” said Ramakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
