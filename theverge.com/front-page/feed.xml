    <title>Nio pulled off an incredible turnaround in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJ5xLy"&gt;Chinese EV startup Nio entered 2020 on the brink but emerged stronger than ever, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;thanks in large part to a government bailout&lt;/a&gt;. That government aid helped Nio get back on its feet just in time to ride a new wave of optimism in EVs — something that’s never been more clear than after the company offered the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1736541/000110465921030345/tm218424d1_ex99-1.htm"&gt;first snapshot of its financial performance for the year on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkQfrj"&gt;To wit, the startup generated $2.4 billion in sales, double what it pulled down in 2019. That was largely thanks to Nio more than doubling deliveries from roughly 20,000 in 2019 to 43,000 in 2020. That’s despite how the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak dragged down the startup’s first quarter sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPE49Y"&gt;Some 17,000 of those vehicles delivered in 2020 were sold in the fourth quarter, too, meaning Nio is building momentum. (In fact, it expects to ship at least 20,000 in the first quarter of 2021, which is typically the slowest.) And Nio now offers multiple vehicles at different price points, meaning there’s more room to grow than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6eZXS3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nio has $6.5 billion in cash after starting 2020 with next to nothing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1jg3q"&gt;Nio still posted an $813 million loss for the year, though that’s roughly half the $1.6 billion loss it suffered in 2019. Most importantly, Nio cut those losses while increasing its cash pile to $6.5 billion — an almost unthinkable figure when you consider that the startup had just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155949/nio-hefei-investment-ec6-bailout-coronavirus-china"&gt;about $300 million in the bank at the start of the year&lt;/a&gt; and was warning shareholders that it may not survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MFkjT7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla’s success helped aim a fire hose of cash at EV startups in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aW2jP8"&gt;Nio had previously tried just about everything to pull out of its self-inflicted nosedive, which was the result of incredible growth and, likewise, cash burn. It laid off thousands and scaled back its presence in North America. It sold off its Formula E race team. It canceled a planned factory in Shanghai, instead opting to continue paying a contract manufacturer to make its EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUFMCO"&gt;Even after all that, Nio still likely wouldn’t have made it to this point &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155949/nio-hefei-investment-ec6-bailout-coronavirus-china"&gt;without the bailout it received from the government one year ago&lt;/a&gt;. While there is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;renewed optimism in the financial markets around electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least, the resulting flood of investments didn’t really kick off until well after Nio had reached its low point. With that investment, though, Nio was able to get more SUVs out the door, launch new models, and keep paying its contract manufacturer. Nio was ultimately able to benefit from the EV boom, too, since much of the startup’s cash pile is the result of selling more shares into the red-hot market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmaEul"&gt;There’s no guarantee that Nio’s momentum will last. In fact, on Monday, the startup offered a &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-nio-sees-first-quarter-221141223.html"&gt;more conservative forecast for the first half of 2021 than expected&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock price took a hit as a result. But that’s the kind of problem you have to be thankful you’re dealing with when you get as close to the edge as Nio was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, I encourage you to read out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Best Wireless Earbuds buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine which pair of earbuds is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EnOnUF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products in general, the AirPods Pro are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant has better sound quality and features noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. But the best deal right now on a brand-new pair is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-24" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them at this price at Best Buy, but they will be &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Geek Squad Certified Refurbished&lt;/a&gt; instead of brand-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mydRHm"&gt;Additionally, the AirPods Pro are currently $200 new at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733671787466828010" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodDeals030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for $220 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or for $125 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of AirPods with a wireless charging case. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are no current deals available for the Galaxy Buds Pro, but you can buy a pair for the usual retail price of $200 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771584476830246" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771635387220077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus were our top pick last year as the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in different color options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9qe27"&gt;Right now, you can get a pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693938480222182" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Samsung’s direct website&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693993307410932" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now — but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. These are a good option if you want earbuds that produce a powerful sound and include lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;Right now, these bean-shaped buds are $140 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697065741752322" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697059048914646" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. Although no deals are available now, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for their normal price of $230 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jabra.com%2Fbluetooth-headsets%2Fjabra-elite-85t#donotlink"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733772512480142500" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If a $230 price tag is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. The Jabra 75t are our pick for the best true wireless earbuds that are ideal for the multitasker in your life. They’re a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9znxnQ"&gt;You can buy a pair in titanium black for only $130 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733698116592948428" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rkCAUU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro.

    <title>Crunchyroll is rolling out an entirely new design for Premium subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SynD8BDOUCGm7QCYxVPS5Cj9vg0=/102x0:1143x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898150/Web_2.0___Carousel_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZrTHye"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; has entirely redesigned the streaming experience on web browsers for Premium subscribers, and  the platform’s new design is rolling out in beta today for some customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tahsHC"&gt;The Crunchyroll Beta adds a couple of heavily requested web browser features: an updated homepage with an easier to navigate layout, more intuitive search capabilities, and a new tool called Crunchylists for creating curated lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QnuPIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The beta is only available to 20 percent of US-based Premium subscribers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="En98YG"&gt;Eligible Crunchyroll Premium subscribers can opt in by clicking on a header image that appears at the top of the website. The beta is currently only available to 20 percent of all Premium users in the US, but it will eventually roll out to all Premium and free tier subscribers. The company is planning to share more information when it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJRbZ8"&gt;Let’s start with the homepage. The new homepage feels much more akin to other streaming services in terms of layout and organization by relying on personalized recommendations. There are both dynamic recommendations and curated recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bnz18"&gt;These sound similar but are ultimately different. Dynamic recommendations are specifically tied to someone’s watch history. For example, because you watched &lt;em&gt;Dr. Stone&lt;/em&gt;, you may enjoy &lt;em&gt;Black Clover &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Rising of the Shield Hero&lt;/em&gt;. Curated recommendations are based around a theme. One example is “sports time, all the time” and includes shows like &lt;em&gt;Hanebado&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eyeshield 21&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Iwatobi Swim Club&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7bquIkzWyQp1AKtmtXea9GDRBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339455/Web_2.0___Curated_Feed_02.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nJKRIP"&gt;Similar to other platforms, these recommendations appear in rows on the homepage that people can cycle through. The layout is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548253/hbo-max-netflix-hulu-streaming-cable"&gt;reminiscent of HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which includes rows based around popular series (“the &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;collection”) or personal recommendations based on what someone has watched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgUoSX"&gt;The new homepage also makes it easier to find ongoing watchlists, or specific show pages, all of which have been redesigned to make it more user-friendly. In an effort to make the newly designed Crunchyroll more user-accessible, changes to the search function — including accessing simulcasts, new anime, and filtering through subtitled or dubbed options — are also rolling out with the beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIg5tJ"&gt;All of the new designs seem focused on making Crunchyroll feel more personal. Subscribers can now create their own unique usernames and choose from an assortment of avatars and header images based on their favorite series — another mainstay of streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMnRCm"&gt;Subscribers will also be able to use the new Crunchylist feature, which simply allows people to make their own curated lists. This allows you to choose any series or episode from a specific show to a list and organize it however you like. For example, if there’s a definitive way to watch the various &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; series, this could be one way to turn that into a customized, personal experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8egKC9tkO34dmgVWxWXUNWJVhuI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339458/Web_2.0___Dynamic_Feed___Continue_Watching.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oDQvTG"&gt;Every major media company is trying to get into streaming, and every popular streaming service — Crunchyroll has more than &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/02/02/crunchyroll-reaches-four-million-subscribers"&gt;4 million paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; — is trying to figure out how to stay on top. Making it easier to find something to watch and hopefully convincing people to spend more time on Crunchyroll, through product changes that make it a better experience overall, is one way to accomplish that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qOPiU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjNZQL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kla8fa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC6pEP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI2btj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="469gCp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy’s creator is back with a classic RPG made of incredible handcrafted dioramas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APpQQNnF2Dz0Ac36UaeWd_sXP7U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898185/1_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi talks about his upcoming Apple Arcade game Fantasian&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Gkoetn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; has everything you’d expect from a new Hironobu Sakaguchi experience. The creator of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series is once again making a roleplaying game that takes place in a lush fantasy world, features turn-based combat, and centers on a globe-spanning quest. There’s even a new soundtrack from famed composer — and frequent Sakaguchi collaborator — Nobuo Uematsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNz5Qt"&gt;But what makes &lt;em&gt;Fantasian &lt;/em&gt;unique is clear from a single screenshot: the game world has a distinct vibe because it’s built from tiny, handcrafted dioramas. “We really wanted to capture that touch and feel, and unique charm, that is only found in these dioramas,” Sakaguchi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBDvfU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is developed by Mistwalker, a studio Sakaguchi founded in 2004, and is currently listed as “coming soon” to Apple Arcade. He says the concept began around three years ago when he and some collaborators replayed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy IV&lt;/em&gt; for the first time in years. “Playing that game reminded me of how much I really adore that classic RPG genre, and renewed my interest in it,” Sakaguchi explains. “It made me want to go back to my roots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4OJNS"&gt;The premise of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, even sounds like classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q35yQB"&gt;The tale begins in a realm governed by machines, in which Leo causes a massive explosion at a hybrid magic-tech factory, resulting in his memory loss. Following the one memory left to him — a vision of a young woman — he is transported to a dusty frontier town called En. There, he is reunited with the girl from his memory, Kina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cwph9L"&gt;In an effort to recover Leo’s memories and find their own destinies, the two set off on an adventure together. During their travels, Leo’s past is revealed bit by bit as are the many layers that make up the game world. Within this multi-dimensional universe, the balance of “Chaos and Order” becomes a key factor in the struggle for these realms and the machinations of the gods who wish to control them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qaIw9BjMGRnafoS9MLZnSWx9UrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339543/Fantasian.001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Mistwalker.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The creation process from concept art to in-game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N53kN6"&gt;Mistwalker has released several RPGs over the years, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Blue Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last Story&lt;/em&gt;; in 2014 the team expanded to mobile with the &lt;em&gt;Terra Wars&lt;/em&gt; series. Sakaguchi says his goal with each new game, dating back to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is to introduce some kind of innovation. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, new features like a mechanic that lets you banish enemies to another dimension to battle later so that you can explore without interruption, as well as combat skills based around aiming, are key selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58oep7"&gt;But the most obvious innovation is the way the game looks — and it was a lot of work. Every space you’ll explore in &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, including both interior and exterior locations, is actually a hand-made diorama. There are more than 150 of them in total, created by a team that included artists who worked on franchises like &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;. The process starts with concept art, and then the artists start building props and other elements of the diorama. Once completed, the set is photographed, turned into a 3D model, and transported into the game engine, where it can then be enhanced with effects like lighting or fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA6Jvo"&gt;Sakaguchi says that the process was “very tedious” and forced the designers to approach their creations differently compared to a traditional video game. “You have to be very conscious and intentional with how you construct the environment, because unlike 3D CG where I can add another path or modify an environment later on, you don’t really have that flexibility,” he says. It also took the team a while to find a 3D scanning method that could show the models with enough fine details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtuVdw"&gt;While he admits that “I was sweating a few times during development,” Sakaguchi says that the painstaking process was necessary to achieve the look he desired. “You could argue, well, if you wanted to make dioramas, you could do a diorama-esque visual using all 3D models, and playing with the textures, or lighting, or shading perhaps. But instead we opted for a much more analog methodology,” he explains, adding that the team had to be “really careful” with post-processing, so as to not ruin the effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqlTD"&gt;The handcrafted feeling was also well-suited to Apple Arcade, where many players will be controlling the game via touchscreens. “There’s an interesting synergy between touching something with your fingers and hands through the screen that has been created by these artisans by hand,” Sakaguchi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uopOHA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; will be playable on iOS, Mac, and Apple TV, and Sakaguchi says that, aside from the touch controls, the game hasn’t been tailored specifically to Apple Arcade. Instead, the goal was to create a console-like experience for mobile devices. He describes the game as “a really comprehensive RPG experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzBXWl5kXMtuyjau8DWolEyuUsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339599/4_4k.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVNCtv_pm8RO54yd1KMDESBJnaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339581/6_4k.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UeWgV-xM6x3tVFf2G07IsRq1m8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339586/battle4_Additional.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOsMA2"&gt;Classic-style Japanese RPGs are having a resurgence of sorts, thanks in part to veteran creators either returning to or sticking by what they love. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787902/dragon-quest-11-yuji-horii-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; creator Yuji Horii started in 1986 and is still going strong&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287791/bravely-default-2-nintendo-switch-interview-square-enix"&gt;comparatively new series like &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt; are designed explicitly to bring lapsed fans back to the genre&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar story for Sakaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMvO9b"&gt;“Let’s be honest, I’m in the latter chapters of my game development career, and each game can take years to go from conception to release,” he says. Because of this, he’s tackling projects that bring him “genuine joy” to work on. “I personally enjoy playing these types of games, and that is what brings me back to it,” he says of his long-standing connection to fantasy RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Os4wd4"&gt;Sakaguchi is also well-known for creating expansive universes, ones that often grow beyond just a single game. It started with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; and continued through to &lt;em&gt;Terra Battle&lt;/em&gt;, which has already seen a sequel and spinoff, with more planned. Right now, that isn’t the goal for &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, which has been designed as a standalone experience, according to Sakaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg6czJ"&gt;Whatever project comes next, Sakaguchi and the team at Mistwalker have to solve at least one problem first — figuring out what to do with &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s 150 painstakingly crafted dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pTvsxp"&gt;“That’s actually one of the biggest challenges we’re facing right now, trying to figure out where to store these things,” he says. “I really don’t want to have to throw them away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGCVzp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aD1vH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Mesh feels like the virtual future of Microsoft Teams meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pKZQds0IgRq4Ya9VEkNnuZbmXjA=/705x0:3135x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897818/Microsoft_Mesh_Hero_Imagery.0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Mesh enables shared virtual experiences.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oZFCyJ"&gt;Last week, Microsoft’s Alex Kipman, the inventor of Kinect and HoloLens, appeared in my living room to hand me jellyfish and sharks. That might sound like I had a weird dream, but it was a meeting made possible through Microsoft’s new Mesh platform. I donned a HoloLens 2 headset, joined a virtual meeting room, and Kipman immediately appeared next to my coffee table, ready to demonstrate Microsoft’s vision for the future of VR and AR — or as Microsoft calls it, mixed reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oCvx8"&gt;It all felt like a Microsoft Teams meeting set in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcoP3c"&gt;Mesh is a collaborative platform that allows anyone to have shared virtual experiences on a variety of devices. “This has been the dream for mixed reality, the idea from the very beginning,” explains Kipman. “You can actually feel like you’re in the same place with someone sharing content or you can teleport from different mixed reality devices and be present with people even when you’re not physically together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K37Iib"&gt;Initially, Mesh will present people as virtual avatars taken from the AltspaceVR social network that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16408626/altspacevr-microsoft-acquisition-vr-community"&gt;Microsoft acquired back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Mesh will eventually support what Microsoft calls “holoportation,” allowing people to appear as themselves in a virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RftMDF6eGOaj_4dnvderqsxmBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339281/microsoftmesh.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can interact with virtual objects freely in Microsoft Mesh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G3dX9P"&gt;During my hour-long meeting in Microsoft Mesh, I constantly felt like this could be a far-future version of Microsoft Teams. Kipman appeared next to me as an avatar and started handing me virtual jellyfish and sharks. I could reshape the animals, pass them back, or just place them down in front of me. Although we weren’t working on some grand design or 3D model, it felt far more immersive than the Zoom video calls I have to attend on a near-daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Qe2y"&gt;It was the next best thing to having Kipman in the room with me and reminded me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868251/microsoft-hololens-hologram-hands-on-experience"&gt;my first experience with HoloLens&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft originally demonstrated HoloLens using a collaborative Skype call where a technician could guide you on how to fix some wiring. It felt like the promise of augmented reality, and Microsoft Mesh seems like the natural next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLq85x"&gt;“You can completely imagine a Mesh-enabled Microsoft Teams, where the key thing there is, think about colleagues from across the globe collaborating as if you and I are in the same physical location,” says Kipman. “Mesh enables Teams to allow organizations to essentially do mixed reality gatherings with everyone in the same room and so you should think about that in a Mesh-enabled Teams-type of an environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_qAeTlpEePES3SUo9TLrY_50L90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339282/Do2MlsI.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is demonstrating Mesh at Ignite this week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej9l9O"&gt;Mesh isn’t just an app for holding virtual meetings, though; it’s an entire platform built on top of Azure that Microsoft hopes developers will tap into. Microsoft is hoping architects, engineers, and designers will all see the promise of Mesh, particularly during a pandemic when it’s difficult to work with 3D physical models without all being in the same room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnNDZz"&gt;Microsoft is also making Mesh available on a variety of devices, including the HoloLens 2, most virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones, and PCs. A preview of the Microsoft Mesh app for HoloLens 2 will be available today, alongside a preview version of AltspaceVR that is Mesh enabled. Microsoft is planning to integrate Mesh into Teams and Dynamics 365 in the future, which might help bring the unique meeting experience I had into a reality for more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUP9p6"&gt;Microsoft certainly thinks Mesh will be the next big thing for mixed reality. CEO Satya Nadella compared the new platform to Xbox Live during his keynote speech at Ignite today. “Think about what Xbox Live did for gaming — we went from single player to multiplayer, creating communities that helped people connect and achieve together,” said Nadella. “Now just imagine if the same thing happened with mixed reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FCZgJ4"&gt;The big thing holding Microsoft Mesh back is the cost of HoloLens devices and VR headsets. While you can jump in from a 2D screen like a phone or PC, it’s nowhere near as immersive as using a headset. Microsoft has tried to bridge this gap in the past with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go"&gt;ambitious projects like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offering AR experiences on mobile phones. That particular project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;didn’t work out&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not clear whether Microsoft Mesh will strike a chord with users either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsjCqv"&gt;Microsoft Mesh will need some strong developer support or offer experiences you just can’t get anywhere else in VR to pick up momentum. Microsoft has recruited filmmaker James Cameron, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic, and the co-founder of Cirque du Soleil to demonstrate the promise of Mesh during its Ignite keynote today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiD961"&gt;A proof-of-concept version of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; running on the HoloLens 2 and virtual concerts certainly show what’s now possible with Microsoft Mesh. The reality will now depend on the popularity of headsets or Microsoft’s ability to market this new technology toward businesses looking to embrace hybrid ways of working as the world navigates its way out of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvYnVY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 2nd 11:40AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making it easier to swap between user profiles in Chrome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DYS9hTStRS6eK7vZmQJVUiEiVU=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897630/New_profile_experience_in_Chrome.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRezsO"&gt;Google is making it easier to swap between user profiles in a new Chrome update that’s rolling out today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlhMGU"&gt;Chrome profiles are nothing new — you can currently swap between Google accounts; keep personalized extensions, apps, history, themes, and bookmarks for different users on shared computers; and sync those settings between devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r8fck2ky4MHjYk1PBk7X7VxFUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339775/New_profile_experience_in_Chrome.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9nRp9a"&gt;Google is rolling out a “revamped” profile experience. Now, if you have multiple profiles set up, a “profile picker” will appear each time you restart Chrome, prompting you to select a user or browse as a guest. Chrome will also prompt you to switch profiles or create a new one “when you might benefit,” Google says. And finally, when you create a new profile, you’ll be able to choose its color with a single click. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkTEcQ"&gt;The new update also includes an expansion to Chrome’s Reading List feature, which was previously limited to the iOS app. Now, you can save articles to read later in the Android and desktop versions of Chrome as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2qTlj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTez87"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EddDYw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoundCloud will pay indie artists based on their actual listeners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncyeLuDmFIogGIX3T7jqrqETB3E=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897482/soundcloud.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRUT6N"&gt;SoundCloud’s trying something new for a major music streaming service: paying indie artists a share of their actual listeners’ subscription fees. The company &lt;a href="https://press.soundcloud.com/197001-soundcloud-introduces-fan-powered-royalties"&gt;calls this&lt;/a&gt; “fan-powered royalties,” and it means a SoundCloud subscriber’s subscription fee or advertising revenue will be divvied up among the artists they actually listen to, rather than going to a big pot and being split up among the platform’s most popular artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ86Fm"&gt;This is a major change for the industry and one indie artists have pushed for. Currently, most music streaming platforms reward the world’s biggest stars with the most royalties. At Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9533266/soundcloud-fan-powered-royalties-user-centric-payment-system/"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, the company figures out how many streams happened on its platform in a given country and then calculates what portion of those streams went to a specific artist. The result is that smaller artists, who might not have massive reach but also have a dedicated, loyal audience, end up not making much money because they represent a smaller portion of the overall streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNddNs"&gt;SoundCloud says today that its new system will change that. It &lt;a href="https://community.soundcloud.com/fanpoweredroyalties"&gt;specifically cites&lt;/a&gt; one musician who has 124,000 followers. With the old model, this artist made $120 a month, but with fan-powered royalties, he makes $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9x5Rj"&gt;For now, SoundCloud hasn’t worked out a deal with the three major record labels — Warner, Sony, or Universal — but it’s able to implement this model with the indie artists it directly monetizes through its &lt;a href="https://creators.soundcloud.com/premier"&gt;SoundCloud Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.repostnetwork.com/"&gt;Repost by SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Repost Select tiers. (These services make SoundCloud the distributor of the music, either only on SoundCloud or on other music streaming services, too.) The nearly 100,000 artists who participate in these programs will be the first to experience fan-based royalties. They’ll receive their first payouts after April 30th this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3ybBn"&gt;It’s unclear how SoundCloud will balance the royalties with its payouts of the major music labels or how it’ll divvy up a listener’s revenue. But for now, this feels experimental. If it’s successful, artists could advocate for more platforms to take this model on, and if it’s not, then the streaming platforms can continue with the status quo, possibly to the detriment of smaller artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIYi87"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Los Angeles’ creator community is starting to move out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oXpxw4Q-6vEIXsOtGOkSlDc9m2I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897436/acastro_210301_4456_LeavingLA_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge | Photo from YoutwoTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Kyhvv"&gt;Logan and Jake Paul &lt;a href="https://www.thehairpin.com/2015/07/did-you-know-all-the-vine-stars-live-in-the-same-building-in-hollywood/"&gt;moved to Los Angeles in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, at the height of Vine’s heyday, and not long after found themselves crammed into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/489227978790813696"&gt;an apartment at 1600 Vine Road&lt;/a&gt; with other young creators hoping to make it big in America’s entertainment epicenter. Over the next few years, they became world-renowned celebrities (often for the wrong reasons), moved into gigantic mansions, and threw the types of obnoxious parties high school kids worshipped and neighbors dreaded. Now, years after they both moved into their own mansions in the wealthiest part of the city, the brothers have independently decided to leave the place they’ve called home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5NL2v"&gt;“I think I got the bug that’s bit everyone leaving LA,” Logan Paul said on his podcast, &lt;em&gt;Impaulsive&lt;/em&gt;, in February. “It’s the closing of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. There’s a lot of senior vibes around the house lately.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOjCDw"&gt;They’re not the only ones, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kcloEr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OnFSESMWF0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhehHK"&gt;YouTube is full of videos posted over the last several months of creators deciding to leave Los Angeles. Some are going back to cities and towns they grew up in to be closer to family. Others, like Logan, are finding entirely new places to live, like Puerto Rico. (Jake has yet to announce where he’s moving.) The exodus is similar to what’s happening in the tech sector, which is seeing employees at companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/technology/san-francisco-covid-work-moving.html"&gt;move away from San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; to set up life elsewhere. Even YouTubers have found that, without a daily routine and places to be, there’s no reason to stay in one of the most expensive cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udF0sU"&gt;“We came here on our visa a year-and-a-half ago,” Jasmine Saini, a YouTuber who moved to Los Angeles from Toronto with her husband, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The first six months were great. Then the pandemic happened. We just realized there’s literally no point of us being here; we can’t go anywhere, we can’t meet with anybody, we can’t network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyVBdw"&gt;Actors, directors, and writers have called Hollywood home for close to a century. But since the early 2010s, online creators have turned the city into their playground. Around 2014, the popularity of the shortform video app Vine helped convince a few future superstars to move to Los Angeles and start working with one another. Jake and Logan Paul (Ohio), David Dobrik (Chicago), Liza Koshy (Houston), Jenna Marbles (upstate New York), and other familiar names came together to collaborate and use the city to carve out their own space within the entertainment capital of the world. Certain areas, like the spot around Sunset and Vine — once referred to as Radio Row — attracted a sea of creators all hoping to become superstars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19YBXI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTTay8bRWGs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bCQnfm"&gt;By 2017 and 2018, creators weren’t just roaming down the streets of Los Angeles with Sony and Canon cameras attached to their hands; they were buying mansions and moving other personalities into their homes. Clout Gang, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17351942/jake-paul-team-10-youtube"&gt;Team 10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747357/david-dobrik-four-year-anniversary-youtube-vine-vlog-squad"&gt;the Vlog Squad&lt;/a&gt; all started turning their lives in Los Angeles into an ongoing show for the internet to watch. More people moved to Los Angeles trying to ride the wave of internet stardom that people like the Paul brothers found just a couple of years prior. Then came TikTok, and hype houses became a staple. The messaging was clear: to become a superstar creator, chances are, you’d have to move to LA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB173c"&gt;But over the past year, that’s changed. The pandemic has limited creators’ ability to collaborate, and going out to different locations to film — like a giant water park or hanging out with wild animals, anything that can be turned into an adventure — can be difficult. Creators say it’s removed their key reason to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOYsvI"&gt;“It closed down any opportunity to work in LA, it changed the social life of LA, which is so much of what you pay for, and it’s very expensive to live in LA,” Brian Redmon, a YouTuber who originally moved to LA for acting, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4tfhnmKV5ts"&gt;said in a November 2020 video&lt;/a&gt;. “I couldn’t hang out with my friends and so many of my friends were leaving LA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgrFSY"&gt;The feeling among some LA-based creators is similar to what many workers in the tech sector have been saying about why they’re leaving San Francisco for a remote-first life. Between March and November 2020, more than 80,000 people left San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://sfciti.org/sf-tech-exodus/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SFCiti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a 79 percent increase compared to the same period in the year prior. If there’s no office to go to every day, and working remotely works just as well, why spend the cash on expensive living arrangements away from family and friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fat003"&gt;Not everyone feels the same. James Rath was already contemplating leaving Los Angeles before the pandemic started and ultimately decided to move back home to be closer to family. But once everything is back to normal, he’s considering moving to New York City, which he thinks will be more accessible as a legally blind person. Ultimately, he still wants to be in a location with access to potential collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn1WUH"&gt;“Creators have adapted very well in this new remote-working world, but I think there is a longing for in-person collaborations and as soon as it’s safe to do so, either creative will return to the city or new ones will emerge looking for the same opportunities as before,” Rath told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lWwqs4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-3yuHKRUXQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SD6gdA"&gt;Not everyone is leaving Los Angeles, of course. David Dobrik just bought a &lt;a href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/david-dobrik-house-sherman-oaks-1203333922/"&gt;$9.5 million mansion&lt;/a&gt; in Sherman Oaks. Los Angeles is still home to the entertainment industry, and there will eventually be a post-COVID world where things return to some form of normalcy. For people trying to break into the industry or find their place within that world, not being in Los Angeles can be career-ending. Almost every creator in videos watched by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said the same thing: they could end up back in LA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQSvli"&gt;But for others, Los Angeles will always be a plane right away. Jasmine and Harjit Bhandal realized they could be home with their families in Toronto and fly out to LA when they needed to in a post-pandemic world. The decision to move was a little easier after three members of Harjit’s family came down with COVID-19, and two wound up really sick. With a built-in subscriber base and contacts already made in Los Angeles, this was the perfect time to go home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWxQ3u"&gt;“Collabs are happening less and less, and I feel like YouTube has definitely changed,” Jasmine said. “We’re paying a ridiculous amount of money for rent, where it’s just the two of us and our dogs. We don’t have anybody else. It just makes more sense to go home. Especially since everyone realized that you can really do anything online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDeOgX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87igot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung starts shipping its most ambitious TV lineup in years</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvY1Kl"&gt;Samsung has begun shipments of its 2021 TV lineup, which is is led by new &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/samsung-neo-qled-4k/75-qn85a-neo-qled-4k-smart-tv-2021-qn75qn85aafxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Neo QLED” 8K and 4K TVs&lt;/a&gt; that use Mini LED technology to achieve greater contrast and improved picture quality than in previous years. With Mini LED, the company is able to cram much smaller LEDs — and way, way more of them than before — into the TV’s backlighting system. This gives the TV much finer control over dimming zones and black levels, and it should dramatically cut down on any unwanted “blooming” effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBVa1S"&gt;This year’s upper-end Samsung TVs also include a number of gaming-centric features like a new settings bar that puts all the crucial next-gen options — refresh rate, aspect ratio, input lag, and so on — within easy reach. Many of the TVs will start reaching customers within the next two weeks, with others to follow in April and thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wBr1fs"&gt;The Frame, one of Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs, is being refreshed with a thinner design and more bezel options for making it look like a piece of art on your wall. And Samsung now says it’s increasing the internal storage from 500MB to 6GB so that customers can now store more artwork — up to 1,200 ultra hi-res images — on the TV that is displayed when it’s not actively being used. Another lifestyle TV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050604/samsung-sero-tv-rotate-vertical-video-tiktok-ces-2020"&gt;the rotating Sero&lt;/a&gt;, is picking up support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 in the near future. (Samsung promised this at the TV’s launch, but has taken some time to actually make it happen.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUCLC0"&gt;The company also announced it’s introducing more traditional form factors for its futuristic MicroLED TVs that aim to leapfrog OLED as the next great TV technology. Instead of offering modular, any-size-you-want options as it does with The Wall, Samsung will be selling the MicroLED set in 110-inch, 99-inch, and 88-inch sizes. Now it’s been announced that a 76-inch model will be added in the future. The 110-inch and 99-inch MicroLED TVs will be available in April. All of them are sure to be exorbitantly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CeISA"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s 2021 lineup shakes out in terms of pricing. I’m not about to recommend you get an 8K TV, though it’s unfortunate that the gorgeous, barely-there bezel design is reserved exclusively for the top-tier 8K series. I’m definitely eyeing one of the Neo QLED 4K sets — especially once sales start to kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuIHS8"&gt;&lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/samsung-neo-qled-8k/85-qn900a-neo-qled-8k-smart-tv-2021-qn85qn900afxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo QLED 8K QN900A series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (the flagship “no bezel” design)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;85-inch: $8,999.99&lt;br&gt;75-inch: $6,999.99&lt;br&gt;65-inch: $4,999.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="67Gy5Y"&gt;The rest of Samsung’s TVs below lack Mini LED and its picture upgrades, but they still offer quantum dot HDR and local dimming. &lt;/p&gt;
