    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>

  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4 will return with a weekly series on Twitch and YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvO_TlhnbN1HOksUp9hfTKO8bXM=/0x0:2011x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735986/B4_G4_Final_Logo_V1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gpcQVY"&gt;The revival of G4, a network focusing on video games with programs like &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt;, is underway. The company announced today that it’s launching weekly series &lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; on Friday, January 29th. The series will air on Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRNDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; is part of the lead-up to the network’s return this summer. It will feature original sketches, music parodies, game reviews, and more. Viewers will also be able to provide feedback on that content via the network’s Reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOCEI"&gt;Twitter accounts for &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; teased G4’s revival &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/24/21337355/sdcc-2020-g4-tv-return-teaser-video"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; during the digital version of San Diego Comic-Con; both shows are expected to return. The network has been hunting for talent via a Twitter campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carrot Weather gets a fresh new design and a bigger shift to subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lN5sEiwjI5IK8EZ6izco50_DCZk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735971/promo_presets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brian Mueller&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xQwx6x"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id961390574"&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/a&gt; — the entertainingly antagonistic weather application from developer Brian Mueller — just got its latest version 5.0 update, which brings a whole new (and far more customizable) design, removes the upfront price tag in favor of more subscription tiers, and, of course, adds new dialogue and Easter eggs for the app’s malevolent AI character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQnbD"&gt;It’s been a few years since Mueller released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16004062/carrot-weather-4-update-ai-app-ios-dark-sky-forecast-fun"&gt;Carrot Weather 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the new update brings a fresh coat of paint to the weather app, with more detailed data that’s broken down into individual cards for things like Moon phases, wind speed, precipitation, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1X8ykyctXGF42743dYRBl-wtWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266256/promo_darkmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWF0FT"&gt;Users are also able to fully customize the layout of those interface cards based on the information that’s important to them, and they can swap between different custom layouts easily. (For example, a frequent skier might want to build a layout that focuses on snowfall and wind speed forecasts.) Everything has been visually updated to be more in line with modern iOS UI standards so the whole app will fit more seamlessly alongside the rest of your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D3plc"&gt;The new app also is now free to use, instead of charging $4.99 upfront to use. Like the old paid version, though, there are still optional subscription services that can be layered on top for more functionality. A Premium subscription ($4.99 per month or $19.99 per year) adds additional features like selecting weather sources, notifications, widgets, and Apple Watch complications. Premium Ultra ($9.99 per month or $39.99 per year) adds notifications for rain and storms, more widgets, and better data source switching. And a Premium Family subscription ($14.99 per month or $59.99 per year) is the same as Premium Ultra but can be shared through Apple’s Family Sharing with up to five other people. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpEbtzKe9hOWCGws3PMTt12NKzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266257/promo_interfacemaker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot’s new customizable Interface Maker tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FQchb8"&gt;If you’ve already been a Carrot owner, though, you’ll get to keep any paid features you already had forever, even if they’ve been moved to one of the pricier tiers. Similarly, existing subscribers to the old Premium Club memberships will be able to continue to pay those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18632642/carrot-weather-app-update-precipitation-notifications-rain-snow-storm-cell-custom-critical-alerts"&gt;lower monthly or yearly prices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlPmy5"&gt;The free version of Carrot Weather includes ads — but for now, they’re either for entirely fake products or for other indie applications. (Mueller says he’s not getting paid for those, either, but views them as a way of “giving back to the awesome indie developer community.”) That said, he notes that he may end up selling ads in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qKEI0"&gt;Carrot Weather 5.0 is available to download now on the App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y16qh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDHmU6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB_SWRTdr9yrUDqwCWGKo4Dh5WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734726/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as the reason it prevented additional trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG1HjA"&gt;Since the decision, Robinhood’s app on the App Store has received thousands of one-star reviews as a form of practice known as review bombing. On the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, angry Robinhood users are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;calling for a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; because “allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation,” according to one post. There’s even a new subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;specifically for suing the company&lt;/a&gt;. Another Robinhood &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewNiss/status/1354821478613540864"&gt;user tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that after years of being on the platform, the move felt like a “slap to the face,” adding “to be regulated in a time of absolute prime opportunities is an embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDJVPq"&gt;On Twitter, beloved rapper and Fyre Fest promoter Ja Rule did not mince words: “Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmLLDl"&gt;Robinhood has been central to much of the chaos within the financial sector over the last few days. Investors from r/WallStreetBets or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;its private Discord server&lt;/a&gt; used the personal finance app to inflate GameStop and other stocks as a blow against Wall Street hedge funds. But now that Robinhood has taken steps to stem the rally, the r/WallStreetBets community feels betrayed — and is already looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FoWbo1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwG0Kz"&gt;The list of brokerages that have stopped allowing trades and buys of the aforementioned stock continue to grow: Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828730674372610"&gt;halted trading&lt;/a&gt;. TD Ameritrade has placed “restrictions on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; transactions in $GME and other securities,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those restrictions “may include actions like increasing margin requirements, or limiting certain types of transactions, like short sales and those that may involve unlimited risk,” the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTNmR7"&gt;After initial publication, Public, an app similar to Robinhood, briefly stopped its users from trading and buying certain stock. The company issued a statement on Twitter, noting, “Our clearing firm, Apex Holdings, has decided to halt the buying of $KOSS, $GME, and $AMC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoShqP"&gt;“We disagree with this decision and are working hard for our members to resolve the issue,” the statement continues. “We’ll provide updates here as they happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxnXvm"&gt;Around 2:45pm ET on Thursday, Public allowed its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354877232762810370"&gt;users to purchase stock again&lt;/a&gt; from companies like AMC and GameStop. WeBull, which temporarily restricted trades on stock from companies like GameStop and AMC, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354875836810342400"&gt;lifted those restrictions&lt;/a&gt; around 2:40pm ET on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgz8G1"&gt;For Robinhood competitors like Public, it’s a golden opportunity. In fact, Public even doubled the free stock slice &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354810368191733770"&gt;for member referrals&lt;/a&gt;. Popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354794425528934405"&gt;tweeted on Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; just after the Robinhood halting began that “everyone complaining about @RobinhoodApp delisting GameStop and I’m over here on @public about to get Bill Gates rich.” He later said that no one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795210765606913"&gt;should take investment advice from him&lt;/a&gt; and that he’s an investor in Public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;“Also im an investor in public and i hope this ridiculous behavior from Robinhood brings attention to superior companies (like Public),” Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795211713470467"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xstnn2"&gt;Switching to a competitor will still add some friction — and might cost investors valuable time in an exceptionally volatile situation. When creating an account on Public, for instance people may have to wait a few days for their application to be approved, according to a message that appears during the signup process. If people are trying to get in on GameStop and AMC while the magic rally is still in effect, that delay might defeat the purpose — although at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter had their account approved in the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YZqB5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u78AiF"&gt;Most apps also allow investors to &lt;a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/2673094-can-i-transfer-another-investment-account-to-public"&gt;transfer their portfolios&lt;/a&gt; from other brokerages, including Robinhood, which could be faster. But there’s still likely to be a significant delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsfbgR"&gt;Webull is another investment app, and the FAQ states that “in most cases, account application is approved automatically.” Webull’s website also states that people can trade in the same day if “you deposit via ACH before 4:00 pm on a trading day” — basically, if funds are transferred from something like a bank to Webull. The site also states, however, that people “will get a provisional credit (up to $1000 depending on the incoming deposit) of buying power after your deposit,” which gives people “provisional buying power to trade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XbLN8"&gt;Transferring stocks from one app to another, or flocking to another app to buy stocks, seems tedious — but as long as it’s unclear when Robinhood and other brokerages will allow purchases, GameStop’s new stockholders are left with no other choice. At the time of publication, GameStop’s stock was sitting at $155 — down from yesterday’s high of $468, but still more than triple where the stock was last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AVdH3"&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich,” popular YouTube creator Ricky “FaZe Banks” Bengston &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Banks/status/1354786829388500998"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You guys fkn blew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjCjvW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 1:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story has been updated to note that Public stopped allowing users to buy and trade certain stock. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlkdEx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2, January 28th, 2:45pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The story has been updated to note that WeBull has removed restrictions on trading. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU5kTd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2, January 28th, 2:56pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The story has been updated to note that Public has removed restrictions on certain stocks, allowing people to buy them once more. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDul1v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 28th, 1:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said that TD Ameritrade halted purchases of certain stock. TD Ameritrade still allows stock to be bought, but there are restrictions in place, like increasing margin requirements. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord is no longer banning r/WallStreetBets — it’s helping them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hK3nzoAWcwhd6yHEdl9KuvMpfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735747/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="izl1Wn"&gt;Discord is now helping the r/WallStreetBets team moderate its new server. The company originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned the group yesterday&lt;/a&gt; due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and revealed it had sent repeated warnings to the team managing the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iDzDm"&gt;Those warnings, for whatever reason, were ignored, but now the r/WallStreetBets team and Discord are working together. Discord staff are actively working with the server’s team to help with moderation. At least one Discord staffer, who is now in the new WallStreetBets server, is also helping with infrastructure problems related to the rapid growth the community is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZJkXq"&gt;“WallStreetBets members have set up a new server and we are working with them,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We will welcome the group back so long as they improve their moderation practices and follow our Community Guidelines. We have reached out to the moderators to provide them with support and advice, like we do for many of our large communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JceCGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Discord has turned into a virtual trade floor with memes, stonks, and chaos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="31iES1"&gt;Discord was left in an awkward position yesterday, after the largely unmoderated server suddenly grew in size and got out of control. It could either let hate speech continue in a community it wouldn’t normally ban or act to shut it down after repeated warnings. The ban appears to have worked to get the r/WallStreetBets moderators to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOL67h"&gt;Hours after the ban, the moderators of the subreddit criticized Discord publicly. “We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore,” said the r/WallStreetBets subreddit moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FqbcK"&gt;The new WallStreetBets Discord server currently has 296,000 members, and it continues to grow every second. It has played a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;central role in the subreddit’s ongoing mission&lt;/a&gt; to drive up the price of GameStop and AMC stock. We’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;following the Discord server growth over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was full of profanity and racial slurs yesterday, whatever work Discord is doing behind the scenes appears to be working to reduce that content today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc9pqa"&gt;There are now fewer people screaming in calls, using racial slurs, or blasting music to the hundreds listening in. The memes are now mainly emoji and text, rather than images that often included offensive material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwMglC"&gt;We’ve asked Discord exactly what is being done to improve moderation for text-, image-, and audio-based communications and how the company was able to resolve its differences with the WallStreetBets. The company wasn’t able to provide details at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft made a giant climate pledge one year ago — here’s where it’s at now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Offices Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buFoTifosoQt4k7bm3W9yCjQh7Y=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735376/1230784777.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDzTqO"&gt;One year after pledging to remove all of its historic and future planet-heating emissions within a few decades, Microsoft says it has already slashed its carbon footprint by 6 percent. It’s an incremental change that’s in line with what’s needed globally to address the climate crisis, but there is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCwnfF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmvLM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;Last January&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pledged to do something that, at the time, was pretty unheard-of: it planned to become carbon &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; by 2030. That gave the company a deadline to capture more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it emits. Not only would it target future emissions, but the company also pledged that, by 2050, it would remove the equivalent of all the carbon dioxide it’s released since being founded in 1975. It made those promises even though the technology to make it all happen doesn’t yet exist at commercial scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUkQXL"&gt;Now, we’re beginning to get a glimpse of what’s actually feasible for Microsoft to achieve. Some of the reduction in climate pollution it accomplished last year was a result of the economic toll of the pandemic. Microsoft will need to continue making cuts year on year without the help of a global crisis. The sustainability report it released today also showed how much the company can actually rely on carbon-removal technologies — which, at the moment, is not very much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGRldy"&gt;When companies set goals to become carbon neutral, or carbon negative in Microsoft’s case, the company &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; saying it will stop pumping out greenhouse gases altogether. What it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do is cancel out some portion of its greenhouse gases by paying other companies and nonprofit organizations to trap and store carbon dioxide. The tricky part of these corporate sustainability pledges is that it’s not usually clear how much carbon dioxide the company plans to cut altogether versus how much it will continue to pollute and then pay to remove from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L34FTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBsUq"&gt;In Microsoft’s case, we now know that the company plans to cut its emissions “by more than half” by 2030. That implies that, in the future, it intends to rely on carbon-removal schemes to make up for almost half of all its carbon emissions. In its &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Mxso"&gt;2020 fiscal year&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft released 11,164,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Since making its carbon-removal pledge last January, the company says it purchased contracts to capture 1.3 million metric tons of CO2, over 11 percent of its total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf5Btl"&gt;Companies can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by funding reforestation projects or technology that captures the greenhouse gas from the air. So far, Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/01/28/sustainability-year-progress-decade-action/"&gt;relied mostly on forests&lt;/a&gt; to suck up and store its carbon emissions. Less than 1 percent of the carbon Microsoft said it removed from the atmosphere last year was seized through emerging direct air capture technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tg9SR"&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem and the world must build a new market on an unprecedented scale and timeline, from nearly scratch,” Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/01/28/one-year-later-the-path-to-carbon-negative-a-progress-report-on-our-climate-moonshot/#_ftn1"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post today. Microsoft started a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund last year to accelerate the growth of that “ecosystem,” but much more will be needed to make carbon removal a successful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIhUAA"&gt;Companies relying on forests to erase their carbon footprint comes with pitfalls, too. Although the strategy is now being folded into the umbrella term of “carbon removal,” it’s typically been described in the past as carbon “offsets.” Offsets have gotten a bad rap because &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into them have shown that they haven’t actually succeeded in permanently trapping carbon dioxide. Companies can claim that they’re canceling out their effect on the climate, when in reality, they’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q8eAKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qRPGfn"&gt;Microsoft funded three conservation projects through the Nature Conservancy, which was the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; last year. Some of Nature Conservancy’s forest preservation projects allowed companies to claim they were shrinking their carbon footprints, when in reality, the forests were not threatened — so there was no additional benefit they were adding to the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2XNs9"&gt;Microsoft acknowledges that its reliance on these kinds of conservation projects is a “big weakness” in its initial work. “Reflecting the state of the market today and our immediate need for carbon removal, nearly all the carbon removal solutions we are purchasing are short-term and nature-based,” Smith wrote. “This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon. The world needs to invent substantially stronger technology-based solutions than are available today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGmdt3"&gt;The world, including Microsoft, also needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place. Microsoft has laid out some plans on how it will do that. It’s tying executives’ pay to their performance on sustainability initiatives. The company said it will also work with suppliers to cut down their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LW8yX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk4NqX"&gt;It also incentivizes teams within the company to come up with ways to make their products more sustainable. One notable result from the program: the company updated the Xbox to reduce the power it uses when it’s in “standby mode” from 15W to less than 2W. (Side note: &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/noah-horowitz/latest-game-consoles-environmental-winners-or-losers"&gt;settings still make a really big difference&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to making the console as energy efficient as possible, according to the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa4wGmhhe5XriaaSkHgj2zb_rVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21880659/6_390Microsoft_0374_1920x1280_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft sunk a data center to the bottom of the Scottish sea in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qQXK7Y"&gt;Microsoft will also have to figure out how to reduce emissions from its data centers, which suck up a lot of energy and are a vital part of its business. It’s already looked into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;storing servers under the sea&lt;/a&gt;, which could save energy by keeping the servers cool naturally without requiring refrigeration. Data centers on land can also use up a lot of water as part of their cooling systems. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;pledged last year&lt;/a&gt; to conserve and replenish water where it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyP6q4"&gt;Microsoft’s goal of halving emissions by 2030 falls in line with science-based targets. In order to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, the global economy will need to roughly halve emissions by 2030, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; by leading climate scientists. By 2050, the world will need to gut emissions to near zero. Carbon removal may offer a small assist, but to get to the Moon, the heavy lifting will have to come from elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing clips on live streams and VODs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3XqbaSQbtRVshlRyA2KsN3hgY4=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735325/youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVCqa1"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/95526465"&gt;is introducing clipping&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to make short clips of live streams or videos — starting today with a small group of creators. Those clips can be anywhere between five and 60 seconds in length and will have a new URL associated with them. Creators and viewers will be able to create clips by clicking on the clip icon, though the feature is currently limited to desktop and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LNE4"&gt;It’s a smart move from YouTube, because clipping is something of a live-streaming industry standard. You can more easily share live video content via a short video clip that can be passed around social media, rather than requiring viewers to skim through a potentially hourslong stream. Every platform from Twitch to the dearly departed site Mixer has decided that it’s something their creators need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6PrDZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we are launching an experimental version of Clips on YouTube. Check out videos on the Creator Insider channel and test it out yourself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clips are 5-60 sec, shareable, segments of content (Live/VOD) that live on top of the original video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj"&gt;https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DVWNQ2BoEx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DVWNQ2BoEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lester (@Chen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chen/status/1354837070460555264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94ajXm"&gt;YouTube adding the feature is just another signal that the online video titan intends to beef up its live-streaming operation. As is the conventional wisdom in streamer spaces, clips help channels grow. A good clip that goes viral can bring in a huge influx of new viewers — and in streaming, where visibility is a big part of creating a sustainable income, that’s half the battle. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AOC and others call for investigation into Robinhood’s GameStop freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Postmaster General To Testify To House Committee About Department’s Ability To Handle Mail In Voting" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhKMnI6YzDtGV3_BUfqMyrQ80n8=/0x0:4629x3086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735142/1228188159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLwuX8"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called on Congress to investigate the Robinhood app after it banned small investors from buying stock in companies like GameStop. Over the last week, Reddit users have rushed to buy the bemoaned video game retailer’s stock, inflating its price in what some are calling the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1352683263001812992?s=20"&gt;squeeze of a lifetime&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eg8HrC"&gt;In a Thursday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez called Robinhood’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock in companies like GameStop and Blackberry “unacceptable,” and that’d she’d “support a hearing if necessary.” Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which &lt;a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/about/jurisdiction.htm"&gt;has jurisdiction to oversee the stock market&lt;/a&gt; and “securities and exchanges” more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQkLNZ"&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) retweeted her message, saying “Fully agree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ZgM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the House Financial Services Committee for comment on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday, but it didn’t immediately respond. Incoming Senate Banking Committee Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said in a statement Thursday that the committee will hold a hearing on the “state of the stock market” in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UBSYD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fully agree.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/rW38zfLYGh"&gt;https://t.co/rW38zfLYGh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkbdjR"&gt;Other progressive Democrats have also made statements on the GameStop shorts, calling for further regulation of the financial industry. “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1IiAA"&gt;Silicon Valley progressive Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) put out a statement Thursday saying, “We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” he continued. “We need more regulation and equality in the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVAgCy"&gt;Later on Thursday, Khanna retweeted Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1354835649250078722?s=20"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, “We need an investigation into RobinhoodApp’s decision and who influenced that. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjej19"&gt;It’s unclear if Congress will move forward with an investigation into Robinhood . At a press conference Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said “interesting, isn’t it?” when asked about the GameStop shorts, but did not forecast any actions Congress planned to take regarding the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2poBYf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 1/28/21 at 1:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article previously said that Reddit users “shorted” GameStop stock. This was incorrect; instead, users rushed to buy the stock, inflating its price. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxGGmj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/28/21 at 3:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include that Senate Banking will hold a hearing on the “state of the stock market” in the future. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-845" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5cc3a2257d544b4d45f0448d6de0ce29&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-6LsWukqqwnnP59jaU2neKAvi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734773/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the year. It’s the first time in six years Huawei hasn’t been in the top five, Canalys notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmUFPMliIJ3tH4ZYKyDlfXYvSGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265688/msedge_yHAlKBDDrF.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020" target="_blank"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s smartphone shipments dropped out of the top five in Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QAHESd"&gt;Although Huawei was still able to hold on to the number three spot overall, thanks to domestic sales in China (where it reportedly shipped 70 percent of its phones in 2019), Xiaomi seized the opportunity to expand internationally and saw shipments increase by 17 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2020 was reportedly Realme, which shipped 65 percent more phones than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhyalT"&gt;Apple’s gains were more modest, increasing by 3 or 5 percent year over year depending on whether you ask Counterpoint Research or Canalys. The latter notes that Apple shipped the most iPhones ever in the fourth quarter of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q13uhFOoULy8NsTeIXRBNF4PxbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265691/msedge_cg52VaBVpy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/" target="_blank"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research reports that Apple overtook Huawei last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLL2G"&gt;Although it’s still the bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world, both reports suggest that Samsung’s smartphone business is losing market share. Both Canalys and Counterpoint say its shipments fell 14 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s still around 50 million smartphones ahead of second place Apple, but the gap appears to be narrowing. Counterpoint says that the South Korean electronics giant is facing stiff competition from Apple at the high end of the market and from Chinese manufacturers in the midrange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9173w"&gt;Overall, the entire smartphone market was reportedly down compared to 2019. Canalys reports that shipments were down 7 percent, while Counterpoint reports a bigger 10 percent decline. Counterpoint blames the pandemic and resulting lockdowns for the drop, but notes that shipments began to pick up in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
