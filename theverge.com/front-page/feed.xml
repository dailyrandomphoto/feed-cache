    <title>A three-pack of Google Wifi mesh routers is just $150 at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YO-_qyVzxOFY_-xyL_YzeidTBs0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682390/dseifert_161205_1307_0004.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjaU66"&gt;If you have a solid internet connection, you owe it to yourself to get a mesh Wi-Fi system. It’ll help to cover more of your apartment or home in fast Wi-Fi. You can get Google’s Wifi &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a three-pack for $150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from $200. This 25 percent discount is the biggest price markdown yet. And considering that Google sells a single Wifi unit for $100, it doesn’t make much sense to opt for that when you can get another two for just $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FySdyE"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s newer Nest Wifi&lt;/a&gt; does offer better range and more features than this product, but these are still worth getting if you’re on a budget (not to mention, it’s cross-compatible with Nest Wifi, should you ever upgrade). Each Google Wifi router has dual gigabit ethernet ports, and plugs in via a 15W power adapter. Unlike the previous iteration of this product that Google released in 2016, this slightly updated version that launched in 2020 has a tweaked logo, and Google says that 49 percent of its plastic part weight is made with recycled material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cNunrk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ceX8Md"&gt;I said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;in May 2021&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft’s once-pricey Surface Duo was finally the cost of a normal phone. But now, it’s the cost of a midrange phone at Woot through the end of the day, or until it sells out. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-att-lte-tablets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the phone with 128GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; is just $398 new at Woot, while the 256GB version is $470. These are the lowest prices yet, but keep in mind that Microsoft has yet to deliver on promises of Android 11 software. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;recent rumors might be pointing to a newer model on the horizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JLRELv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10517551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jItbjO"&gt;There’s another phone deal happening on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with 128GB of storage at Amazon. Usually $1,200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Pro-Grade-SM-G998UZKEXAA/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can pick it up for $950&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $25 above the lowest-ever price. This phone will work with any US carrier via LTE, as well as with all US carriers that offer 5G. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ut8GLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vrl4YU"&gt;Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones still aren’t in what’d I’d call “affordable” territory, though the price is getting cheaper week to week. At a retailer called Simply Mac, &lt;a href="https://store.simplymac.com/products/apple-airpods-max"&gt;you can snag a set at $440&lt;/a&gt; — the lowest price yet — by adding them to your cart and entering the code &lt;strong&gt;INSTA20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EcwLNP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nU7TDV"&gt;Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch console &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5OKGLH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $46 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It has been this price before, but it’s worth alerting you to this deal, in case you’ve recently picked up a Switch. This is the latest version of the game, and it earns its namesake as the ultimate version of &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, with more characters, stages, and modes than any of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kzygfT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I3l6wh"&gt;If you haven’t yet seen &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt;, the brilliant 2021 film about a Korean-American family struggling to make a living while finding purpose and happiness in the Ozarks, you can rent it for just $1 for the next few days through myriad streaming services (it was recently $20 to rent, since it skipped theaters). Check it out in 4K UHD at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WM12N1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fdetails%2FMinari%2F1650962&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610997%2Fgoogle-wifi-mesh-routers-microsoft-surface-duo-samsung-galaxy-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vudu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fmovie%2Fminari%2Fid1549611916&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610997%2Fgoogle-wifi-mesh-routers-microsoft-surface-duo-samsung-galaxy-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fminari%2F8d6kgwxn8060%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Minari?id=ft2C0LLXSGM.P&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Nest cameras and doorbell have lower prices and more smarts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSXX1kcFMZiaffGpS9h3NXl4kn8=/0x383:5000x3716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682323/Nest_Cam__battery__Indoor__5X4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bynt9u"&gt;Google has announced a new line of home security cameras and a video doorbell under its Nest brand. The new models, which include an indoor-only camera, an indoor / outdoor camera, a floodlight, and the video doorbell, replace the older &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15881258/nest-cam-iq-home-security-camera-review"&gt;Nest IQ cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Nest Hello doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. The main themes with the new devices are a unified design language and more accessible pricing — each model costs less than the camera it’s replacing, while adding more capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MCo0U"&gt;The design of the new cameras will be familiar to anyone who’s seen other Nest products released in the past couple of years, such as the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest WiFi&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; smart speaker. The company has been moving toward softer edges and muted color palettes, and the new cameras adhere to that with color options that are meant to blend in, not stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8C0m0j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design echoes what Google has done with other recent Nest products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gx5Fj"&gt;Google is also adding a bit more intelligence to the cameras, thanks to advances in on-device machine learning. The new models can detect people, animals, packages, and vehicles and provide specific alerts for each of them without the need for cloud processing (or its related subscription costs). (The Familiar Faces feature, which uses cloud-based facial recognition, still requires a paid plan.)  The idea behind it all is to cut down the noise from constant motion notifications, a common complaint with home security cameras and video doorbells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBwg2y"&gt;Google says the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in the new cameras allows the algorithms to run on twice as many pixels and at twice the frame rate of previous Nest Cams, which provides more reliable event detection and alerts, similar to how a TPU will improve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;upcoming Pixel 6 smartphone’s capabilities&lt;/a&gt;. The cameras also include three hours of event history without a subscription and have internal storage for up to an hour of event clips (roughly equivalent to a week of events) in case the Wi-Fi goes down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ojxpjm"&gt;Lastly, Google is pitching versatility with this lineup, as both the doorbell and the new Nest Cam can be used in either battery-powered or wired configurations. There is also a range of accessories available for wall or table mounting, or setting up a camera indoors or out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGUBgL"&gt;What you won’t see emphasized with the new models is 4K resolution or spec-race hardware advancements. Google says the tradeoff required for 4K video — higher bandwidth consumption, larger cloud storage costs — outweighs the benefits. Plus, Google believes things like better HDR processing and smarter notifications are more helpful than just increasing the resolution would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fXhxxg"&gt;Google Nest Cam&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcnsNOHMjXHe6lakQSL7CnyCrJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762374/Nest_Cam__battery__Outdoor_rain_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam can be used indoors or out and has a weather-sealed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aqeDGT"&gt;The centerpiece of the lineup is the new $179.99 Nest Cam, which can be used indoors or out. (Sophie Le Guen, Google’s lead product manager for Home and Nest products, tells me that outdoors is where the company is seeing the most interest and growth in security cameras.) It has an internal battery that the company claims lasts up to three months between charges with typical usage. It can also be wired into permanent power; an optional weatherproof power cable or solar panel is available for outdoor installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyJPHv"&gt;The Nest Cam has a soft, rounded design partially made with recycled plastic, but it maintains IP54 weather sealing. Google says its magnetic mounting base has been tested to withstand storm force winds and there will be an anti-theft mount that can be used to make sure the camera isn’t stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoB_ZIDeZpbXOV-ZdMe_gq3LtKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762376/Nest_Cam__battery__with_stand__separate_accessory__16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam’s magnetic base makes it easy to mount to a wall or place on a shelf.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xiF0w"&gt;The camera records 16:9 1080p video at up to 30fps through a 130-degree field of view. You can zoom up to 6x digitally in the Google Home app when viewing the feed or a recorded clip. Should you need more than the three hours of event history (clips of events that happened within the past three hours) included for free, you can pay for a Nest Aware or Aware Plus subscription that offers up to 10 days of 24/7 recording and 60 days of event history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwvtWJ"&gt;The new Nest Cam is available in white and can be preordered starting today, August 5th, with shipments expected to begin on August 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2GCcPa"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9nlQpufaIKWiY0J-w66awyOr7NQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762385/Nest_Cam_with_Floodlight__US_SKU__night_close__16X9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JqogeW"&gt;The $279.99 Nest Cam with Floodlight is Google’s first connected floodlight camera and fills a gap in the lineup that other companies have addressed for some time now. Effectively, it’s a Nest Cam attached to a 2400 lumen floodlight. It requires permanent power — no battery option here — and features IP65 weather resistance rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwim77"&gt;Unlike standard floodlights, which get triggered by any sort of motion, the Nest Cam with Floodlight can use the same intelligence available in the other cameras to only activate when it detects a person or vehicle. This separates it from other floodlight cameras, such as the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro, which turns on and records a clip for any motion it detects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpl7EZ"&gt;Google says the Nest Cam with Floodlight will be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1vU9HD"&gt;Google Nest Cam Indoor&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJA66OhWE8Xiz9dPzmQxlFFppwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762386/NestCam_wired__Colors_Snow_SandMaple_Linen_Fog_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor is much smaller than the standard Nest Cam and comes in four colors to better match your interior decor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zYJf0s"&gt;The simplest and least expensive new camera in the lineup is the $99.99 Nest Cam Indoor. A much smaller camera than the standard Nest Cam, the indoor model lacks the battery and weather sealing of the more expensive model, but maintains the same camera specs and intelligence features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTZWFP"&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor will be available in four colors (white, pink, beige, or green) to better match your decor or other Nest products you might have in your home. There’s also an optional wooden base available for it and the camera can be placed on a table or mounted on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIMEWP"&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor is expected to be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vEzJwF"&gt;Google Nest Doorbell&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDb95ZV0_R4i0lqH5_AFg-47E14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762387/Nest_Doorbell__battery___Snow__buttonpress__perspective__16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell is Google’s first battery-powered video doorbell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vGdTO"&gt;The $179.99 Google Nest Doorbell is the first video doorbell from the company to work on either battery or wired power. (The $229.99 Nest Hello doorbell from 2018 was limited to wired-only configurations.) It’s compatible with more homes than Nest’s earlier doorbell and comes in four colors (white, beige, green, or gray) to better match your entrance decor. Google says typical battery life is about two and a half months between charges, though that is impacted by how busy your doorway is and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAM3WJ"&gt;The Nest Doorbell has a 3:4 tall aspect ratio, similar to the old Nest Hello, which Google says allows you to see visitors head to toe and packages that are as close as eight inches from the door. The vertical field of view reaches 145 degrees, though it’s not clear how wide the horizontal field of view is. (A mounting wedge is included in the box to adjust its viewing angle for different entrances.) The Nest Doorbell can record 960 x 1280 pixel video at up to 30 frames per second and has both night vision and HDR capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ql2EjxMZzxtuEifFwM4R5WHYSeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762389/Nest_Doorbell_battery__Colors_Snow_Linen_Ash_Ivy_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell is available in four different colors: white, beige, gray, or green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vgAWxa"&gt;Like the new Nest Cam, the Nest Doorbell includes up to three hours of event video history out of the box, but you can subscribe to a paid plan for longer storage (you can’t get 24/7 video history on the Doorbell, however). One of the biggest benefits for the original Nest Hello was how quickly it provided notifications or a live feed on a Nest Hub smart display after the bell was rung compared to other video doorbells — we’ll have to see if the Nest Doorbell maintains that performance when running on battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKes9o"&gt;The Nest Doorbell can be preordered starting today, August 5th, with shipments expected to begin on August 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gf7ctb"&gt;
&lt;p id="jbwIM5"&gt;The new cameras fill some obvious gaps in Google’s smart home lineup and make it more competitive with Ring and others that have had floodlight cameras and battery-powered doorbells for years now. The lower prices also make the cameras more accessible than before, though they aren’t nearly as affordable as the cameras available from Wyze and other smaller brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGGL6k"&gt;But if you’ve got a smart home that centers around the Google Assistant, cheaper budget cameras or Ring products won’t work as well for you and you certainly won’t have as cohesive of an experience as you’d get with Google’s own devices. We’ll see just how good that experience is when we get a chance to review the new cameras in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgxODG"&gt;Lyft is boosting its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20936982/lyft-pink-subscription-price-discount-perks"&gt;$19.99-per-month Lyft Pink membership program&lt;/a&gt; with new bike-share benefits and an annual option that’s cheaper than paying for the service month to month, the company announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBicLg"&gt;Lyft Pink’s primary benefit is a 15 percent discount on car rides, but previously, it also offered three free 30-minute bike or scooter rides per month (in certain markets). With the new bike-share benefits, you’ll get an unlimited amount of 45-minute bike rides on “classic” bikes (aka non-electric) at many of the company’s bike-share systems across the US as well as discounted rates on e-bike rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSQllQ"&gt;The new annual option for Lyft Pink will cost $199 per year, which is a $40 discount over paying monthly. If you regularly use Lyft year-round and enjoy other Lyft Pink benefits like priority airport pickups and three waived cancellation fees per month (if you rebook within 15 minutes), the annual option could be a good way to save a little cash. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yelp will let businesses list their vaccination policies  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pggTfHSC1fNYoS8_56M3aIxUFI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681872/Yelp_Vaccination_Attribute_Filters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users can search via the new attributes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Yelp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYWa98"&gt;Yelp will let businesses share their policies on COVID-19 vaccinations, the company announced today. There are a pair of new attributes businesses can add to their profiles; one to share whether their staff are fully vaccinated, and one to specify whether customers will be required to provide proof of vaccination. Businesses can list the attributes via their Yelp for Business accounts. allowing users of the service to find places with policies they’re most comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5QQZ"&gt;The ability to list vaccination policies joins a long list of pandemic-focused features Yelp has added to its service over the past year. Early on in the pandemic, the service let businesses specify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21187939/yelp-coronavirus-social-distancing-restaurants-nightlife-review-moderation-relief-fund"&gt;whether they offer virtual or contact-free services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21291496/yelp-new-coronavirus-safety-tools-business-owners"&gt;later expanded this&lt;/a&gt; to other safety measures like whether they offer outdoor dining, or have a face masks policy for staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25GouWPOsg3NJoZjvKSjDl1g82E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763052/Yelp_Vaccination_Attributes_via_Yelp_for_Business_App.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses can add the attributes via their Yelp for Business account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmvxY"&gt;But some of Yelp’s attempts to help businesses during the pandemic have been less warmly received. In March last year it was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21196446/yelp-gofundme-coronavirus-automatic-opt-in-fundraiser-pause"&gt;reverse a controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192127/yelp-donation-buttonn-gofundme-local-businesses-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;automatically add fundraisers&lt;/a&gt; to the pages of tens of thousands of small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbVoTZ"&gt;Vaccination policies have become controversial in some circles, so Yelp is also emphasizing the moderation work it does to prevent businesses from being review-bombed as a result of their choices. It says it’s proactively monitoring the pages of businesses that choose to display these policies, and that it will remove reviews that focus on them rather than a customer’s actual experience with a business. Over the course of 2021, Yelp says it’s removed thousands of reviews for violating its COVID Content Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3dTv4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeE1gL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ban of third-party researchers ‘deeply concerning’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Hjobedv0U3NAQFNJfBJs_V_L-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681838/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiAAmt"&gt;Facebook is being criticized by politicians and researchers for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banning the accounts&lt;/a&gt; of academics who analyzed political ads and misinformation on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m7uUZ"&gt;In press statements, Senator Mark R. Warner (D-VA) said the company’s actions were “deeply concerning,” while Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she was “deeply troubled” by the news. Creator of the Firefox browser, Mozilla, which conducted a privacy audit of the academics’ work, said Facebook’s justification for banning the researchers was “wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9ujU6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In our view, those claims simply do not hold water.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yhDOQF"&gt;“Facebook claims the accounts were shut down due to privacy problems with the Ad Observer,” wrote Mozilla’s chief security officer Marshall Erwin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “In our view, those claims simply do not hold water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdQwvi"&gt;The academics banned by Facebook worked with the &lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt;NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, creating a browser plug-in called &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;Ad Observer&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook users could install to collect data about what political ads they were shown and how they were targeted. Facebook does not provide equivalent information, says the NYU Ad Observatory, not least because, as the researchers have shown, the company sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;fails to label political ads&lt;/a&gt; at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II9ZGh"&gt;Facebook has defended its ban of NYU Ad Observatory accounts and pages by saying it’s protecting users’ privacy. It’s a not-unreasonable argument given that the Cambridge Analytica scandal sprung from third-party researchers scraping the site for user data. But critics say Facebook has got the details wrong. Mozilla, which examined the code and consent flow of the Ad Observer plug-in, is adamant that it presents no privacy threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxJNn0"&gt;As Mozilla’s Marshall Erwin &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis his):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qf6YBA"&gt;We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency. It collects ads, targeting parameters and metadata associated with the ads.&lt;strong&gt; It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers.&lt;/strong&gt; The extension also allows you to see what data has been collected by visiting the “My Archive” tab. It gives you the choice to opt in to sharing additional demographic information to aid research into how specific groups are being targeted, but even that is off by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qi5GML"&gt;As reported in Casey Newton’s &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-scrapes-some-researchers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook claims the plug-in may collect some information about third-parties. For example: ”If an individual pays to boost a post, such as for a fundraiser, information including that user’s name and photo winds up in the NYU researchers’ hands.” But as Newton notes: “In any of these cases, the actual harm to the user would seem to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; minor, if you can call it a harm at all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSgGUP"&gt;In a statement, Senator Warner said Facebook’s actions were exactly the wrong response to current worries about political ad transparency and misinformation on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaJxYq"&gt;“This latest action by Facebook to cut off an outside group’s transparency efforts — efforts that have repeatedly facilitated revelations of ads violating Facebook’s Terms of Service, ads for frauds and predatory financial schemes, and political ads that were improperly omitted from Facebook’s lackluster Ad Library — is deeply concerning,” said Warner. “For several years now, I have called on social media platforms like Facebook to work with, and better empower, independent researchers, whose efforts consistently improve the integrity and safety of social media platforms by exposing harmful and exploitative activity. Instead, Facebook has seemingly done the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus releases Windows 11-ready BIOS updates with automatic TPM support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBZ6VFqBFzjhTxeIUPyeXZZHji8=/0x1:1682x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681709/asuswindows11biosupdates.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gRdfKK"&gt;Asus is making a range of its motherboards ready for Windows 11. The motherboard manufacturer has released BIOS updates for a variety of chipsets, including ones that support Intel Kaby Lake processors from 2017. Both Intel and AMD chipsets are supported, and these new BIOS updates will even automatically enable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) on AMD and Intel systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBCr2O"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;TPM is a minimum requirement for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a change that caused some confusion after many realized their PCs didn’t have the option enabled in the BIOS, or it was confusingly named “PTT” or “PSP fTPM” in BIOS settings. Microsoft’s Windows 11 upgrade checker didn’t ease that confusion initially, so it’s encouraging to see big manufacturers like Asus now enabling TPM by default so people don’t have to dig around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkAnnb"&gt;While Asus is planning to support a wide range of motherboards for Windows 11, not every BIOS update is available just yet. &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/asus-begins-rolling-out-windows-11-compatible-firmware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has spotted a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fmicrosite%2Fmotherboard%2FASUS-motherboards-Win11-ready%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610869%2Fasus-windows-11-bios-updates-download-tpm-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of Asus motherboards&lt;/a&gt; that are compatible with Windows 11, so you’ll need to check to see if your system has an update waiting for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yGIs6t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"},{"title":"Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Windows 11 is free, but your CPU might not be officially supported ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mOrr9Y"&gt;If you purchased a pre-built PC and you’re not sure of the exact motherboard inside, you should be able to find the model number listed when you navigate to Start &amp;gt; Run &amp;gt; msinfo32 in Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRkqf"&gt;Asus isn’t alone in its motherboard support for Windows 11. &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/1925"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=19151&amp;amp;title=tpm-2-0-support-and-windows-11-intel"&gt;Asrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/news/news.php?S_ID=468"&gt;Biostar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/Introducing-Windows-11-on-MSI-devices"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt; have all released lists of supported systems that will work with Windows 11. It’s still not clear exactly when Windows 11 will be available as a free upgrade to Windows 10 users. Microsoft has only officially said this holiday, but the software maker keeps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;hinting at an October release date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson is writing a book about Elon Musk, says Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xdOO7uAIPsP47VoXgqfFckUun_8=/181x0:2131x1300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681691/elon_wario.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musk has an interesting relationship with his self-image, as evidenced by his appearance on SNL as Wario. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: SNL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngiZwA"&gt;Like most of the super-rich, Elon Musk has one eye on his legacy, keen to shape how his huge fortune is perceived now and in the future. This perhaps explains why he recently shared the fact that Walter Isaacson, biographer of Steve Jobs, is writing a book about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX69b5"&gt;“If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp;amp; my general goings on, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson"&gt;@WalterIsaacson&lt;/a&gt; is writing a biography,” tweeted Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTqGsh"&gt;He added in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423155872524558341"&gt;subsequent tweets&lt;/a&gt; that Isaacson has shadowed Musk “for several days so far,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423136151813050372"&gt;and that&lt;/a&gt; he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s biography of US founding father Benjamin Franklin. He also repeated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423105264010530821"&gt;that he will&lt;/a&gt; “maybe one day” write his own autobiography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4SGOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk says he “particularly liked” Isaacson’s book about Benjamin Franklin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmmV4x"&gt;There have been a number books written about Musk’s life and his career, including a 2015 biography, &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,&lt;/em&gt; by Ashlee Vance. The book, which Musk contributed several interviews to, was well received by reviewers. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10baeaea-ffab-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “a riveting portrait of Silicon Valley’s most driven entrepreneur [...] personal flaws and all,” while &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/books/elon-musk-a-biography-by-ashlee-vance-paints-a-driven-portrait.html"&gt;offered similar praise&lt;/a&gt;, though noted that the work occasionally veered “toward hagiography and the diction of news releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2iD8f"&gt;Musk has been less happy with other books written about him, though, including Tim Higgins’ recent &lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century, &lt;/em&gt;which was published earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmWxfR"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;review from &lt;em&gt;The LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says Higgins’ book “takes the shine off” Musk, showing him to be “a hair trigger of an executive who’s quick to fire people whether they deserve it or not.” The book has generated numerous news stories, including a particularly wild tale that Musk demanded to be made CEO of Apple after the iPhone-maker approached Tesla about an acquisition. Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;both denied that this ever happened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwOxr"&gt;With Isaacson, though, Musk will likely know what to expect. Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was written with “unprecedented” access to the Apple founder and praised for its detail, readability, and emotional insight. But, as we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/27/2517152/book-review-steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson"&gt;noted in our own review&lt;/a&gt; from Laura June in 2011, the biography is also “in some respects [...] a book told through the often discussed ‘reality distortion field’ of Steve Jobs himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkFp0h"&gt;“[T]hough other opinions or sides to a story are presented, Steve always has the last, blunt word,” says June of Isaacson’s biography. That sounds like something Musk would like, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden wants half of new cars sold in 2030 to be hybrid or all-electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYfFbhG9on1mizR_sf6xbXNIWe0=/57x0:5064x3338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681656/1232967835.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gq7DU8"&gt;President Biden wants 50 percent of all new cars sold in the United States in 2030 to be all-electric, plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen-powered — a goal he will lay out in an executive order later today, according to senior administration officials. In addition, his administration will propose new fuel economy and emissions standards that will more or less erase the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;rollback&lt;/a&gt; of the previous Obama-era rules covering cars made through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwuofZ"&gt;Biden will also sign an executive order that tasks the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop aggressive long-term rules to support his 2030 target, ones that include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOq35a"&gt;“When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking,” read a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627"&gt;tweet from the President on Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LnqGOd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking. Tune in for big news tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/riIClqPYnw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/riIClqPYnw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— President Biden (@POTUS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1423073087009050627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7KPgD"&gt;This planned shift away from internal combustion engines is not as aggressive as the approaches that have been proposed or set in motion around the world. The European Union has proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;a de-facto ban on sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, though France has pushed back on the phaseout of hybrids, which still use fossil fuels. The United Kingdom wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;stop selling new combustion engine vehicles by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. China &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/27/china-plans-2035-gas-car-ban-that-doesnt-actually-ban-gas-cars/"&gt;wants all new cars sold in 2035&lt;/a&gt; to be hybrids at the very least, but is aiming for 50 percent to be plug-in hybrid, battery electric, or hydrogen-powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="occUb0"&gt;California, ever the leader on state-level environmental regulations, is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to ban new gas cars&lt;/a&gt; by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoXcC8"&gt;On the policy side, the proposed rule from the NHTSA will look to lock in average annual fuel economy increases of just under four percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and an ultimate fleet-wide average of around 52 miles per gallon for 2026 model-year vehicles. Under the Obama-era rule, automakers had to increase the average fuel economy of their fleets by five percent each year, with the goal of hitting a fleet average of 54 miles per gallon in the 2026 model-year cars. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;lowered this dramatically&lt;/a&gt; — during a climate crisis and a respiratory virus pandemic, no less — to yearly increases of just 1.5 percent and a target average of 40 miles per gallon. It did this despite the EPA previously determining that automakers were “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17226192/epa-emissions-standards-old-data-fuel-automakers"&gt;over-complying&lt;/a&gt;” with the Obama-era rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC6QAY"&gt;The EPA, meanwhile, will propose a rule that requires emissions reductions that scale with the proposed fuel economy gains, as fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions are intrinsically linked. The two rule proposals will now go through a months-long public comment process before final rules are proposed and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5TVXu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Big Three Detroit Automakers are on board, mostly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9C7PXq"&gt;The Biden administration’s new proposals have already won support from some major automakers, which will separately announce their own goals for electrifying their fleets later today. Representatives from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (the company that was created when Fiat Chrysler merged with France’s PSA group) will appear alongside Biden as he announces the executive orders and proposed rules, as will leaders of the United Auto Workers union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiKaRc"&gt;That said, as was reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-say-they-aspire-up-50-ev-sales-by-2030-sources-2021-08-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;those three Detroit automakers are only committing to a “shared aspiration” of 40 to 50 percent of new car sales being plug-ins by 2030. They’re also asking for the government to pitch in big time, not just on incentives for new electric vehicles, but also “incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States,” according to a press release. The Biden administration has been pushing to support electric vehicle adoption in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;the bipartisan infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, though some proposed investments (like for charging stations) have already been cut back in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CMuKE"&gt;GM has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;be carbon neutral by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and that eliminating tailpipe emissions from its vehicles by 2035 is merely an “aspiration.” Ford, which has found early success with the Mustang Mach-E, has committed to going all-electric by 2030 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker plans to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;40 percent of its fleet all-electric by that year&lt;/a&gt; globally. Stellantis had previously said more than 40 percent of its North American sales in 2030 &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/stellantis-ev-plans/"&gt;would be plug-in vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjurNO"&gt;While the Detroit automakers have announced massive investments in electric vehicles, they were certainly not as united on policy during the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjBYca"&gt;After the EPA and NHTSA moved to roll back the Obama-era standards under Trump, Ford (as well as Volkswagen, Honda, BMW, and Volvo) struck a deal with California to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;keep aiming at a relatively strict target&lt;/a&gt;. GM and what was still Fiat Chrysler at the time, meanwhile, actually joined the Trump administration’s fight in court over California’s right to set its own emissions standards. The automakers (along with Toyota) have maintained that they joined the court bid because they believed it should be up to the federal government to set these types of standards. But they have since abandoned that fight — GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;just after the 2020 election&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2021/02/02/fiat-chrysler-toyota-dump-trump-california-fight/4357446001/"&gt;Stellantis earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Biden’s EPA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;already moved to restore California’s emissions regulation authority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ks6aXJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is investing billions in EVs but sided with Trump before last year’s election &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xo7i6b"&gt;All-electric vehicles currently only make up about &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/"&gt;two percent of total sales in the US&lt;/a&gt;, though they’ve jumped sharply in recent months as the new and used car markets have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;gotten red hot&lt;/a&gt;. More than 100,000 fully electric vehicles were sold in the US in the second quarter of 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/electrified-vehicle-sales-accelerate-in-q2/"&gt;Kelley Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, driven in large part by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;success of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV&lt;/a&gt;. But hybrid vehicle sales were up, too, with more than 250,000 sold — a 200-percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84tcSj"&gt;In some respects, Tesla is already the kind of automaker that the Biden administration wants others to evolve into. Tesla only makes electric vehicles, and CEO Elon Musk’s penchant for vertical integration means Tesla’s cars are built out of an &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/23/tesla-top-3-most-american-made-cars/"&gt;exceptionally high amount of American-made parts&lt;/a&gt;. But the company won’t be part of Thursday’s event. “[S]eems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1423156475799683075"&gt;tweeted early Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1RUFD"&gt;Biden is likely to speak Thursday about wanting electric vehicles to be made by union workers, though, and Tesla has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351157/tesla-elon-musk-delete-anti-union-tweet-national-labor-relations-board"&gt;famously pushed back on unionization efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Other all-electric vehicle startups are moving forward towards production without union workforces, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22406064/uaw-union-rivian-lucid-motors-faraday-future-lordstown-labor"&gt;UAW has said it’s already planning to try to change that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVwgsi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 8:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added info about Elon Musk’s tweet and other EV startups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo profits decline year-on-year as Switch hits 89 million sold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kvkkg6ZtST_5x51GN6u6_8e6h74=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69681638/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kM5x0e"&gt;Nintendo has released its earnings for the April-June quarter, and while the figures would normally be strong for what’s usually a slow period, revenue and profit are both down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356750/nintendo-earnings-q1-2020-switch-animal-crossing-sales"&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. That’s perhaps not surprising given the company was then riding a surge in demand for video games during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and had just released the mega-hit &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58WzGM"&gt;By comparison, Switch hardware sales were down 21.7 percent to 4.45 million units, and software sales decreased 10.2 percent to 45.29 million units. Nintendo has now sold 89.04 million Switch consoles in total; for comparison, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;just hit 10 million&lt;/a&gt;. Revenue decreased 9.9 percent to 322.6 billion yen ($2.94 billion), while operating profit was 119.6 billion yen ($1.09 billion), a 17.3-percent decline year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s now sold nearly 34 million copies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l1MRj"&gt;Nintendo’s biggest release this current quarter is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which came out last month. The company can expect a boost in Switch hardware sales next quarter due to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;new OLED model&lt;/a&gt; in October, even though it isn’t bringing the widely expected upgrade in power. Nintendo’s slate of games for that all-important holiday quarter includes &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, and remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines will let you watch 30 minutes of TikTok in the air for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airfield At Miami International Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TlDp_ZUENTpTBOyZ58ZSzQeHdg=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680846/1323904371.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGSpgm"&gt;Free TikTok has arrived on some of American Airlines’ flights, according to &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Passengers will be able to use the app for up to 30 minutes for free, which gives them time to watch at least ten of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;new, longer TikToks&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have the app already installed, the airline says you’ll be able to download it for free while in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gHbI"&gt;The move to make TikTok available to travelers comes as airlines are trying to get attention back on flying, after the &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/march-2021-airline-passenger-volume-shows-signs-aviation-recovery"&gt;number of people traveling&lt;/a&gt; by air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;dropped during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. One of its competitors, United, has also been adding tech upgrades to its fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596430/united-airlines-preorder-food-drink-website-app"&gt;allowing passengers to pre-order in-flight snacks&lt;/a&gt; and adding planes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;support bluetooth audio for the in-seat screens&lt;/a&gt;. American has &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2020/12/16/american-airlines-to-offer-free-inflight-messaging-and-new-priority-boarding-perks/"&gt;recently allowed passengers to use Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; for free in-flight, giving them at least some connection to the outside world — something that some of its competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16375474/delta-free-in-flight-messaging-whatsapp-imessage-facebook-planes-gogo"&gt;have done for years&lt;/a&gt; for it and other messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3cFsL"&gt;According to the airline’s press release, the promotion is a “trial.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that customer response will determine how long the trial will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peD9CB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline suggests TikToks about travel and finance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJKNh"&gt;If you’re planning your flights around free TikTok, it’s probably worth keeping in mind that it doesn’t seem like every flight will have access to it. American Airlines specifies that the promotional offer is limited to narrow-body aircraft that have Viasat Wi-Fi systems. A lot of planes in &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/planes/planes.jsp"&gt;the airline’s fleet&lt;/a&gt; seem to count as narrow-body, but planes like the Boeing 787 &lt;a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/widebody/"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. American also uses &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/entertainment/wi-fi-and-connectivity.jsp"&gt;a few Wi-Fi providers for its flights&lt;/a&gt;, so even if a flight has Wi-Fi there’s a chance it won’t be from Viasat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUy2wE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;airline’s press release&lt;/a&gt; tells its passengers that they can expect to find a ton of content on the platform, including “travel inspiration” and “career advice.” While it’s hard to imagine many people sitting on a plane watching TikToks about how to make a resumé, spending a half hour looking up short videos about wherever you’re going isn’t actually the worst idea. Let’s just hope that your time isn’t eaten up by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610175/amazon-tiktok-fake-ad-flo-rida-low-roblox-apple-bottom-jeans"&gt;bizarre fake ads with Flo Rida songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
