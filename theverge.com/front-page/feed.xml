    <title>Games Done Quick’s speedrunning summer marathon kicks off Sunday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdIkD1aC__J8ifpD3FDNEFSVBiQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69539912/i_s6hBWf5_X5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SGDQ is You.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Games Done Quick&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkV5Kp"&gt;Games Done Quick’s weeklong summer speedrunning event for charity begins on Sunday, and looks to have a whole bunch of good runs to look forward to. Things kick off for Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) Online 2021 at 12PM ET on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;Games Done Quick Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPJUu"&gt;You can see the &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s packed with a treasure trove of interesting-looking runs. There’s a lot I want to check out, but I think I’m most interested in the &lt;em&gt;blindfolded &lt;/em&gt;70-star run of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZXjrT"&gt;SGDQ and its wintertime counterpart, Awesome Games Done Quick, are two of my favorite weeks of the year. I love watching players absolutely dismantle some of my favorite games, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRFVZHBj5Pc"&gt;this run of &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or pulling off superhuman stunts, like beating the hardest levels of the already-hard platformer &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_3f3q1bybQ"&gt;using a dance pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p5nf9x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_3f3q1bybQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqxSI"&gt;But since the marathon runs every hour of every day until it’s over, I also love checking the stream at random times of the day and just watching what’s on. Often, I’ll be introduced to a game that I’ve never heard of before, and it’s fun to learn all about it from people who are masters of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAi3yy"&gt;As the name of the event implies, SGDQ Online 2021 will take place entirely online (which was also the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21366548/summer-games-done-quick-2020-gdq-online-virtual-speedrun-marathon-charity"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;). Donations will benefit Doctors Without Borders, and in 2020, SGDQ raised more than $2.3 million for the charity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for the Star Wars: Visions anime anthology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IB-0YZ-iPn-eyURR1_mV3JcGF-k=/91x0:1066x650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69538928/0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wrH7nL"&gt;At an Anime Expo Lite panel, LucasFilm revealed the very first look at &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming anthology of short anime films set in a galaxy far, far away. The sneak peek featured a huge range of visual styles and ideas, with shorts that featured, among many other things, a rock opera, a chibi Boba Fett, droids in straw hats, a twin Star Destroyer, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW25iF"&gt;“We really wanted to give these creators a wide creative birth to explore the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy,” LucasFilm executive producer James Waugh said during the panel. “We wanted this to be as authentic as possible to the studios and the creators. The idea was, this is their vision, riffing off all of the elements of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy that inspired them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2SwLm"&gt;The shorts announced at the event, and the studios working on them, include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V13nUI"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Duel&lt;/em&gt;  by Kamikaze Douga (&lt;em&gt;Batman Ninja&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JO228T"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lop &amp;amp; Ocho&lt;/em&gt; by Geno Studio (&lt;em&gt;Golden Kamuy&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UoEZiR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tatooine Rhapsody&lt;/em&gt; by Studio Colorido (&lt;em&gt;A Whisker Away&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wFZyzG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Twins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Elder&lt;/em&gt; by Trigger (&lt;em&gt;Kill La Kill&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ohIRgO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Village Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Kinema Citrus (&lt;em&gt;Tokyo Magnitude 8.0&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RLUiBR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Akakiri&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T0-B1&lt;/em&gt; by Science Saru (&lt;em&gt;Japan Sinks&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TI4ZYc"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Ninth Jedi&lt;/em&gt; by Production IG (&lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTJ9r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; was first announced last December, and is described as “an original series of animated short films” that “celebrates the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy through the lens of the world’s best Japanese anime creators.” The anthology will be available on Disney Plus when it premieres on September 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QN8WwV"&gt;Anime has become a big focus for streaming services, with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559498/amazon-prime-video-evangelion-rebuild-us-streaming-release"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; snapping up big-name titles. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; will mark the first major anime series to debut on Disney Plus. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/25/8287017/tie-fighter-anime-star-wars-movie-accurate"&gt;fan projects have clearly demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; in the past that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and anime are a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some accused in Capitol riot reportedly tried to scrub info from their phones and social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Protest at Capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAVzNhECKvEJLn4sNiF4K1nZ46g=/96x0:5351x3503/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69538310/1230453213.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOJS2X"&gt;Some 49 people accused of taking part in the January 6th riot at the US Capitol building have tried to erase images, videos, and texts from their phones and social media accounts, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-capitol-siege-business-electoral-college-media-efe0ea1092bc11c6d3f42ea4ef752d98"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, citing a review of court records. Authorities told the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; that the people may have realized that the many photos and videos posted to social media by people participating in the riot could be used as evidence against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpeDM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;cited several cases where accused rioters’ social media posts apparently contradicted what they told authorities about their involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNazWQ"&gt;Hundreds of supporters of former President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th as members of Congress prepared to certify the results of the presidential election. More than 500 people have been arrested in connection with the riot, Attorney General &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-investigation-january-6th-attack-capitol"&gt;Merrick Garland said last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNKkeR"&gt;In the days following the attack, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222200/social-media-telco-urged-preserve-evidence-capitol-attack-twitter-facebook-google-verizon-apple"&gt;asked mobile carriers and social media platforms&lt;/a&gt; to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may have been connected to the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elWrOk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capitol-riot-media-attacks/2021/07/02/8af871d2-daa7-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Saturday that the Department of Justice has started arresting people who attacked reporters documenting the riot, damaging their equipment. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports that the people would be charged with committing violence or destroying property on the grounds of the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>REvil ransomware attacks systems using Kaseya’s remote IT management software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/za4_wgjffpbrOkGPICnqMIxI9Vc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536123/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncWJdH"&gt;Just in time to ruin the holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attackers&lt;/a&gt; have apparently used Kaseya — a software platform designed to help manage IT services remotely — to deliver their payload. Sophos director and ethical hacker Mark Loman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markloman/status/1411035534554808331"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the attack on Friday, and reported that affected systems will demand $44,999 to be unlocked. A note on Kaseya’s website implores customers to shut off their VSA servers for now “because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APKSa0"&gt;On Saturday, Kaseya issued another update, saying that it had been advised by its outside experts that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links – they may be weaponized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiPDUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News Flash: cybercriminals are a$$holes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep all the Incident Response teams in mind this holiday weekend as they're in the thick of it...again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you use Kaseya VSA, shut it down *now* until told to reactivate and initiate IR. Here's the binary: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p"&gt;https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt"&gt;https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1411046946349924359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2vfPv"&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-200-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack targeted six large MSPs and has encrypted data for as many as 200 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xaRdz"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/kaseya-supply-chain-attack-delivers-mass-ransomware-event-to-us-companies-76e4ec6ec64b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoublePulsar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Beaumont has posted more details about how the attack seems to work, with REvil ransomware arriving via a Kaseya update and using the platform’s administrative privileges to infect systems. Once the Managed Service Providers are infected, their systems can attack the clients that they provide remote IT services for (network management, system updates, and backups, among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHOwjZ"&gt;In a statement, Kaseya told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “We are investigating a potential attack against the VSA that indicates to have been limited to a small number of our on-premises customers only.” A notice claims that all of its cloud servers are now in “maintenance mode,” a move that the spokesperson said is being taken due to an “abundance of caution.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUXOwx"&gt;Later on Friday evening, Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola issued a statement saying they estimated the number of MSPs affected is fewer than 40, and are preparing a patch to mitigate the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADfnRG"&gt;“While our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises customers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS servers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability,” Voccola said in the statement, adding that the company’s SaaS customers were never at risk, and reiterating that “only a very small percentage of our customers were affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Roq7cX"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-03/number-of-victims-continues-to-grow-in-massive-ransomware-attack"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-03/number-of-victims-continues-to-grow-in-massive-ransomware-attack?srnd=premium&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the attack was affecting more than 1,000 businesses in a ripple effect; the attack focused on managed service providers, but these providers offer IT services to other companies that may now be affected as well. A grocery chain in Sweden reported it couldn’t open 800 of its stores on Saturday when the attack resulted in its cash registers malfunctioning, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4kS3K"&gt;The attack has been linked to the notorious, REvil ransomware gang (already linked to attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year), and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/revil-ransomware-executes-supply-chain-attack-via-malicious-kaseya-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that, collecting incidents under more than one name, this may be the third time Kaseya software has been a vector for their exploits. REvil has previously been linked with Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GTT00"&gt;But President Biden said late Saturday afternoon that the US government wasn’t sure whether Russia was involved in the attack, &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/biden-says-not-sure-if-russia-is-behind-latest-cyberattack/2021/07/03/c8b8c686-dc3a-11eb-8c87-ad6f27918c78_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. “I directed the intelligence community to give me a deep dive on what’s happened, and I’ll know better tomorrow, and if it is either knowledge of and/or consequences of Russia, I told Putin we will respond,” he told reporters during a trip to Michigan. Biden added that he hadn’t yet called Russian President Vladimir Putin about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1kfOv"&gt;Kaseya said Saturday it would &lt;a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/"&gt;provide updates&lt;/a&gt; on the situation every three to four hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtbSuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 2nd, 10:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Kaseya CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OzdLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd 12:04PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information from Kaseya and updates about the spread of the attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzdtym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from President Biden &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dutch court rejects Facebook’s bid to have privacy lawsuit in the Netherlands dismissed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-61LwGSniCEFRZ5Kp_ir3HJ63gQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69538140/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D8fBQ7"&gt;A court in &lt;a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307"&gt;Amsterdam ruled that privacy litigation&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook in the Netherlands can proceed, rejecting the social network’s bid to have the lawsuit from two non-profit groups thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2rvIF"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, the Amsterdam-based Data Privacy Foundation and Dutch consumer advocacy organization Consumentenbond are suing Facebook on behalf of users over what they claim are violations of European Union privacy law. The lawsuit says Facebook has not provided enough details about the information it gathers from users, including what it does with the data, and therefore doesn’t have a legal basis to process the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNt9I7"&gt;Facebook tried to block the lawsuit claiming that the Amsterdam court doesn’t have jurisdiction over its European business, which it argues is subject to Irish law. The Court of Amsterdam disagreed, writing in its decision that “The Data Privacy Foundation may litigate before the Dutch court on behalf of Dutch users of the Facebook service against Facebook about whether Facebook has violated the privacy of its users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNdCWo"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was reviewing the court’s decision, noting that the ruling was procedural, and that the company would continue to defend its position in court. “We care about our users in the Netherlands and protecting their privacy is important to us,” the spokesperson said. “ Users have meaningful control over the data that they share on Facebook and we provide transparency around how their data is used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWFsip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 12:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the documents behind big legal cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court 3 (Verge Stock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lE7yPbOrRipyhKI4eLX3HBJEKs=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537983/Supreme_Court_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pKDf0I"&gt;Earlier this year, I spent a month covering the trial for a dispute between Apple and Epic. The case was one of the biggest antitrust suits in recent memory, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;brought to light revelations&lt;/a&gt; about both companies and the larger tech industry, often in the form of legal filings. I (and other reporters) try to pick out the most relevant details from these filings for readers. But sometimes, the documents are worth checking out in their own right. A site called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt; makes that easier than it might sound — if you know how to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sTwLF"&gt;US federal court documents are supposed to be publicly available through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. But as somebody who frequently uses PACER, I can confirm it’s a really frustrating system. Signing up is a hassle, it costs 10 cents to run a search or retrieve a single page of a document, and all those charges add up quickly if you’re hunting down information about a case. PACER is basically a video game loot box mechanic for the legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igqvp9"&gt;This limits access to resources that can help people understand US law &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;countless individual news reports better. (Some journalists re-upload and link filings via Scribd or DocumentCloud, but not every outlet follows this practice.) It also walls off a lot of stuff that’s simply interesting or funny. Want to read about FBI agents hunting a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1408405285874671624"&gt;possibly mythical&lt;/a&gt; cache of gold stolen from the US Treasury during the Civil War by a secessionist secret society and then hidden in an underground cave network? &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.paed.540418/gov.uscourts.paed.540418.6.0.pdf"&gt;The court system has you covered&lt;/a&gt;. Or take &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf"&gt;this recent ruling&lt;/a&gt; on the Federal Trade Commission’s case against Facebook, which may include the most portentous description of MySpace and Friendster ever written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3nlzhm"&gt;At the dawn of our century, in the much earlier days of the internet, a number of websites began to offer what came to be known as “social networking” services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WhNwFa"&gt;If you’d like that in the form of a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; opening crawl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z3P8et"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Damn someone got there before me! &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKgwv5icl2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKgwv5icl2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— No Context Paddy O'Connor (@paddypadman2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paddypadman2/status/1409622320579284994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zu9uM"&gt;Fortunately, there’s an unofficial PACER workaround. Maintained by the nonprofit Free Law Project, CourtListener hosts a free and open archive of millions of filings. It contains court opinions, audio of oral arguments from trials, and something called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/"&gt;the RECAP archive&lt;/a&gt; — which is where you’ll find a lot of the most interesting material. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;the long back-and-forth between Apple and Epic&lt;/a&gt;, government allegations like the &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476.1.0.pdf"&gt;cryptocurrency fraud claims&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547643/john-mcafee-dead-prison-spain-us-extradition"&gt;late antivirus tycoon&lt;/a&gt; John McAfee, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;important legal decisions&lt;/a&gt; like a judge tossing the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18735353/federal-trade-commission-v-facebook-inc/"&gt;Facebook antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCBDfG"&gt;The RECAP archive is a giant crowdsourced library based on a &lt;a href="https://free.law/recap/"&gt;browser extension&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. When a user with the RECAP extension logs into PACER and downloads a document, a copy of it gets saved to the archive. Anybody can access it from there, whether or not they’ve got the extension installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpNNap"&gt;RECAP is dependent on PACER users sharing a file, so you generally can’t get documents that nobody has looked up. But if you’re reading about a lawsuit or a big criminal case in the news, there’s a good chance you can find details in the archive. (One catch: PACER covers the federal court system, so if somebody was sued or charged at a state level, you’re probably out of luck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VynUm"&gt;Navigating CourtListener can be a little overwhelming. On the RECAP archive, it’s helpful to search by the name of one of the parties involved, then narrow your search by district or state with the “select jurisdictions” filter. For instance, if you know a company was sued in California, you can select the four California districts under the “Federal Districts” tab. Sorting by “Newest Cases First” can be helpful for lawsuits and criminal charges that were just filed, and “Newest Documents First” can be good for cases that were just decided. If you have one document from a case already, you can look for the case number listed at the top of each page and search that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the “Select Jurisdictions” filter in the RECAP archive, showing the South, Central, Northern, and Eastern districts of California selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0V6yoj2yYFPafTZWq3yH_cDLfrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695939/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_11.43.31_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R8LseO"&gt;When you click on a case, you’ll get its docket: a long record of everything that’s happened. Near the start of the list, you’ll probably find a complaint or indictment containing the allegations against the defendant in the case. You may also see a list of exhibits, or evidence like email chains or images. Further down you could find orders, where a judge hands down a decision. If these documents have been uploaded to the archive, you’ll see a link to download the file. If they haven’t, RECAP can direct you to PACER if you have an account — in which case this &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; is a great time to &lt;a href="https://free.law/recap/"&gt;install RECAP&lt;/a&gt; and start uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoBFtp"&gt;It’s important to remember that court documents are written for companies, individuals, and agencies with a specific agenda, and they don’t necessarily tell the full story of an event. (For example: the FBI did not find that hidden gold.) Interpreting them often requires background knowledge about specific terms and prior cases, although there are resources that can help, like writer and attorney &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1160925"&gt;Orin Kerr’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to reading a judge’s opinion. Even so, they’re a valuable tool for digging into some of the biggest stories &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; covers — and sometimes a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite summer gear for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgG4rUPagNTsqt1M5OO0SokivUM=/0x680:2040x2040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537864/SeanK_Green_Khaki_42153ef6_8cdc_4937_9d43_31d3cfda5ef4_2048x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Wise Owl Outfitters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ewWslG"&gt;After over a year of indoor living, people are finally able to go out and enjoy the outdoors: beaches, sports, hiking, camping, bird-watching, bicycling, picnics… you name it. We asked some of our colleagues from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they were planning to take with them in their outdoor escapes. Here are some of their recommendations, including outdoor tech, camera gear, rugged footwear, and gadgets that help you take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nQhZc3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outdoor tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j9eNDN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmi.com/blogs/blog/the-zmi-powerpack-20000"&gt;ZMI PowerPack 20000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6TO6UW"&gt;Twelve months predominantly spent indoors did wonders for my battery anxiety. Not only was I using my phone less, thanks to having constant easy access to a tablet and laptop, but even when my phone got close to running out, my trusty charger was never far out of reach. However, I know that’s going to change this summer, and I’ll be confronted by the fact that my shiny new iPhone 12 Pro’s battery life really isn’t as great as I’d like it to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZrr0V"&gt;That means it’s time to bust out my ZMI QB820 PowerPack (more recently released as the ZMI PowerPack 20000), a hulking brick of a portable charger equipped with a massive 20,000mAh battery. Yes, I could probably get a slimmer model, but to me those feel like a half-measure: if I’m going to bother to carry a standalone portable charger, it might as well be massive. It charges over USB-C, and there are two additional USB-A ports to charge other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k97Vf"&gt;It’s basically the last portable charger I see myself needing. Well, until someone makes an identical model with MagSafe, I guess. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dDgTrf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634595"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QRk4IW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jukYwu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yCoiMD"&gt;For a while, I was resisting the urge to get a pair of fully wireless earbuds — I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks when I’m walking around, and my old single-ear Plantronics Explorer 500 headset worked fine. But the idea of being able to sit outside on a summer’s day listening to music finally proved just too much for me, so I checked out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;roundup of best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1zOvf"&gt;My main phone is an Android and in addition, I’ve put myself on a budget, so the top-rated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; were both out of range. I finally went for the Jabra Elite 75t earbuds — and so far, I’m very happy with them. They have good sound quality (especially after I tweaked the settings); they work with two devices at the same time, which I find very useful when I’m working on my laptop and somebody calls; and I was able to get a pretty good deal on them during Amazon’s Prime Day sales (especially since the 75t is one iteration down from the more recent 85t model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJX21y"&gt;Unfortunately, old habits are a bit hard to break, and I find myself, more often than not, only using a single earbud (the right one) as if I were still wearing my Plantronics headset. But for those times this summer that I want to listen to music, I’m set. &lt;em&gt;— Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bNpWJa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ntm5Ib"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thxkzm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;Sonos Roam portable speaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lb5DL6"&gt;For the longest time, my go-to portable speaker for camping and backpacking was the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ultimateears.com%2Fen-us%2Fwireless-speakers%2Froll-2.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22560614%2Fsummer-gear-tech-favorite-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UE Roll 2&lt;/a&gt;. It was small and efficient, but it didn’t mesh well with the rest of my audio setup, especially on those sweltering summer days when I barely made it beyond the confines of my own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNOBYc"&gt;This year, however, I splurged on the Sonos Roam. The rugged, pint-sized device is on the pricier side when compared to other Bluetooth speakers, but it produces solid sound for the size, offers wireless charging, and can automatically jump between my home Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth, a convenience I’ve come to appreciate when strapping the speaker to my bike and heading out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7XZcT"&gt;And while I might not be able to fire off my usual quips at Alexa when I take it into the backcountry — the Roam only supports voice commands when connected to Wi-Fi — I certainly can still do it poolside with a drink in hand. &lt;em&gt;— Brandon Widder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M3IGvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lyeo5D"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="45RAVU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get out your camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jcHQX2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://topodesigns.com/products/camera-cube?variant=13779500367925"&gt;Topo Designs Camera Cube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yhqDfl"&gt;Years of daily bus commuting turned me into a person who needs their backpack to do everything — hold a laptop, water bottle, snacks, sundries, actual roller skates, you name it. As versatile as camera backpacks have become, I still can’t convince myself to buy a backpack that only has one job. The Camera Cube was invented for people like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FHx98"&gt;If your camera kit is on the lighter and smaller side, then Topo’s camera cube is a fantastic way to turn all of your bags into camera bags. I’ve used it with a Topo hiking backpack on many a day hike, and I appreciate the drawstring closure that keeps my camera gear more secure inside the cube. It also fits into my non-hiking backpack and technically in my &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.madewell.com/the-transport-tote-53228.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Madewell Transport Tote&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s usually too heavy to wear on my shoulder for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UilVJI"&gt;It comes with removable foam dividers so you can divvy up the storage space for an extra lens or two, but I’ve found it’s also a handy way to store a bagged PB&amp;amp;J where it won’t get crushed on a long hike. The navy and yellow color option is also quite attractive. It’s a little too small for a big DSLR and a zoom lens, but it’s the perfect fit for my compact mirrorless kit, and a small victory in my quest to avoid uni-tasking backpacks. &lt;em&gt;— Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LPcQI8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dsjoDA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3QnxFz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Holga-144120-120N-Plastic-Camera/dp/B000AL8JKW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Holga 120N Plastic Camera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RUJbJL"&gt;This low-tech classic camera has made some of my favorite photographing memories. It’s all plastic and has a fixed setting of 60mm f/8 using medium-format 120 film. The Holga has a cult following because of its price and the charm in the imperfections it creates. There is an artistry to taping the camera in different ways to block light leaks and other quirks, and the occasional softness from bowing film or the vignetting look is where Instagram got the look for its filters.&lt;em&gt; — Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KHFs9j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy living&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whtu1J"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsodastream.com%2Fproducts%2Ffizzi-starter-kit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22560614%2Fsummer-gear-tech-favorite-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SodaStream Fizzi Sparkling Water Maker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lzIMsn"&gt;I always have two to three drinks with me at any given time, and at some point in the last couple of years I became hyper-aware of the number of plastic bottles I was using just to drink pop or seltzer. (I’m from the Midwest — it’s pop not soda!) I tried to switch to glass bottles, but that got expensive. After much deliberation and a sorry attempt at trying to become a strictly water and coffee drinker, I decided to get a SodaStream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX6TiM"&gt;I’ve only had the SodaStream Fizzi for a while, but I am so thrilled with it. I use it every day to make my own sodas and sparkling waters, and to add a little flair to homemade cocktails. There are a large variety of recipes online, but it’s more fun to get creative with different flavors. Lately, I’ve been using fresh peaches and some muddled mint from my herb garden for a fantastic refresher! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6dJUM"&gt;The SodaStream Fizzi does have a small learning curve and takes some experimentation to find the amount of bubbles that you like, but it’s a blast to use. &lt;em&gt;— Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbsBK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GBJIFX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7ZbO9n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiseowloutfitters.com/collections/camping-hammock/products/doubleowl-hammock?variant=29613744328"&gt;Wise Owl Portable Hammock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iqSw6p"&gt;I bought a hammock last year, and I’m never going back to any other way of relaxing in a park over the summer. It’s super portable, super easy to set up, and perfect for just taking a lazy Sunday, reading a book, and watching the clouds roll by. — &lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o7cVqE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303743"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="j53z7i"&gt;Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite e-reader is a great gadget that lets you read books outside without having to worry about things like lugging around a thousand-page tome or dealing with the potential of wet pages. The Paperwhite’s E Ink screen is very visible outdoors (unlike most phone screens, which can be harder to see in bright sunshine), and the newest Paperwhite is waterproof, meaning it should be able to safely handle a splash or even a brief dip in the pool. Happy reading. — &lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2s8NUN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634774"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EDTssj"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="db94di"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer walking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R7l7pT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birkenstock.com%2Fus%2Fmilano-oiled-leather%2Fmilano-core-oiledleather-0-eva-u_5326.html%3Fdwvar_milano-core-oiledleather-0-eva-u__5326_color%3D5326&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22560614%2Fsummer-gear-tech-favorite-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Birkenstock Milano sandals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="whILAd"&gt;Yes, I am recommending a pair of sandals. I’m justifying them on this list as technology for your feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThOhW9"&gt;For years, my go-to summer footwear was $20 flip flops, but those usually broke by the end of the summer and I didn’t particularly enjoy walking around in them. I’ve only owned the Birkenstock Milano sandals for two months, but they’ve become my favorite pair of shoes I’ve ever owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEpEmx"&gt;After a week or so of breaking them in, they fit like a dream, and I’ve already taken them on many long walks. I can’t wait to use them during the summer weeks ahead. I went with the Milano style because of the strap on the back so that they would be better for extended adventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PewAaX"&gt;At $125, they’re certainly the most expensive pair of sandals I’ve ever purchased, but they have already proven their worth. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fb7J6g"&gt;I invite you to click through and look at these Trapper-Keeper-ass shoes. Really, just get their vibe. I spent a lot of the pandemic hiking — hell, I even took up running — and these trail runners from Saucony are really, really good. They’re grippy on uncertain terrain without being too heavy or stiff, so whether I want to jog on some dirt or knock out a long hike, these are my go-tos. Obviously, the shoe that works best for you will vary based on your foot and gait and so on, but if you’re thinking of taking up hiking, trail runners are lighter than hiking boots and often more comfortable. Plus, you can wear some genuinely shocking neon. &lt;em&gt;— Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gVL6vM"&gt;If you want to go hiking and, like me, find hiking boots unbearably uncomfortable (especially in the summertime), I can give these sandals from Bedrock Sandals two thumbs up for being ultra-comfortable and durable hiking shoes that will keep being comfortable even after a river crossing or five (and for being versatile enough to bike in and wear to the beach or grocery store). &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird plans a pilot program for electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals in NYC this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGILDhJCgI1Sa3-7QZzbyIiyAt8=/65x0:959x596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537788/bird_scootaround_offer_on_demand_accessible_mobility_cities_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bird is piloting a mobility scooter rental program in New York City | Bird&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGcP7E"&gt;Scooter company Bird is partnering with mobility vehicle company Scootaround on a pilot program that will test accessible electric vehicle rentals in New York City this summer, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-scootaround-offer-on-demand-accessible-mobility-cities/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. A new button in Bird’s main app will let people with mobility issues choose one of three different models to rent, including three- and four-wheel scooters and the Whill Model Ci2 power wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYn2EW"&gt;Once the rider chooses a vehicle, they pick a rental length between one and 14 days. Riders will get an in-person tutorial the day of their rental to ensure they’re comfortable using, charging, and storing the vehicle. Bird has a toll-free number for questions about the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuY2qJ"&gt;“As micromobility options such as shared bikes and scooters continue to expand, we must ensure the benefits of these improved transportation networks be made as widely available as possible, including to persons with disabilities,” Kerry Renaud, CEO of Scootaround said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVeNCG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204232/new-york-legalizes-electric-bikes-scooters"&gt;New York State lifted its ban&lt;/a&gt; on electric scooters in 2020, and the city Department of Transportation announced Bird, Lime, and VeoRide would be part of its e-scooter pilot in the Bronx this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ONzBn"&gt;Bird plans to roll out the partnership with Scootaround to more cities later this year, based on the results of the NYC pilot. &lt;/p&gt;

Better yet, the retailer says these are “Grade A” units, which means they won’t have anything more than minimal cosmetic wear. These work on GSM and CDMA carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company pitches underground transit loop to Fort Lauderdale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk’s Boring Company Demonstrates Transport Tunnel Underneath Las Vegas Convention Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mY19EtN00dGVy-Pmt20s0DtXS1c=/8x0:5402x3596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537632/1311709601.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ROtoYc"&gt;The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunneling venture, pitched an underground transit system to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the town’s mayor said in a tweet. It’s the latest city to become transfixed by Musk’s quixotic “Tesla in a tunnel” concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoPnEx"&gt;It’s not a done deal, but Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it “an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing traffic congestion and transit needs.” Trantalis said the project, which would be called the “Las Ollas Loop,” would connect Fort Lauderdale’s downtown to the beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qh5FHB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fort Lauderdale has received a proposal from Elon Musk's The Boring Co. to build an underground transit loop between downtown and the beach. Called “The Las Olas Loop,” this represents an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing traffic congestion and transit needs.&lt;/p&gt;— Mayor Dean J. Trantalis (@DeanTrantalis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DeanTrantalis/status/1410317226327121921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5sQa5"&gt;To be sure, the Boring Company has only dug three tunnels — a test tunnel in Los Angeles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455365/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-test-lvcc-loop-teslas"&gt;two 0.8-mile tunnels underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2020/1/8/21046929/elon-musk-ces-vegas-boring-company"&gt;has yet to be proven out as a functional transit system&lt;/a&gt;. Musk’s early idea of an underground transit system for high-frequency autonomous electric “sleds” capable of carrying dozens of people has been scrapped in favor of a system that can only accommodate individual Tesla vehicles. And industry experts have cast Musk’s efforts as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/urban-tunnels-musk-s-boring-co-draw-industry-skepticism-n1269677"&gt;little more than “hot air.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EZI5AC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, the Boring Company has only dug three tunnels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NlMUpE"&gt;Nonetheless, Musk has managed to impress a handful of city officials with his concept Teslas ferrying passengers through neon-lit tunnels. In addition to Fort Lauderdale, the Boring Company has also proposed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269188/elon-musk-boring-company-miami-tunnel-mayor-francis-suarez"&gt;$30 million loop system in Miami&lt;/a&gt;. Previous projects, such as a proposed 35-mile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18507839/elon-musk-boring-company-dc-baltimore-hyperloop-report"&gt;Washington, DC-to-Baltimore tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18256604/elon-musk-chicago-mayor-election-tunnel-high-speed-transit"&gt;Chicago loop system&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be canceled. (The DC-to-Baltimore project has disappeared from the company’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEq6JH"&gt;According to the city, the Boring Company reached out earlier this year to “discuss underground alternatives to the construction of a high-rise commuter rail bridge over the New River.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gaiaov"&gt;“The underground transit loop would provide quicker and more efficient access between downtown and the beach as well as alleviate street-level traffic,” the city said &lt;a href="https://www.fortlauderdale.gov/Home/Components/News/News/5887/16?backlist=%2fhome"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE4gn7"&gt;More details about the Fort Lauderdale proposal, such as the length of the tunnel and the total cost, are still unknown. The city says that state law prohibits the release of the specifics of the plan until the competitive process is concluded. The City Commission is scheduled to vote on whether to accept the proposal on July 2nd, during which other firms can come forward with competing ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
