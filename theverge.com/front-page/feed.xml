    <title>Moscow adds facial recognition payment system to more than 240 metro stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Face Pay launched at all Moscow Underground stations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3GUG-zSzh5ttgZyd6qs6hC0MNk=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001561/1235893124.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l9dT0o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mosmetro.ru/news/detail/?news=802"&gt;Moscow launched “Face Pay” on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, a facial recognition payment system implemented in more than 240 Mosmetro stations, “the largest use of facial recognition technology in the world,” officials claim (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service relies on stored photographs to validate metro payments, an obvious privacy concern given the previous uses of facial recognition technology by the Russian capital’s law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCs3tj"&gt;Face Pay requires metro riders to upload a photo and connect their bank and metro cards to the Mosmetro mobile app. With everything uploaded, all you need to do is look at the camera posted above the turnstiles to make it in time for your next train. Moscow authorities expect 10 to 15 percent of riders to use Face Pay “regularly” in the next two to three years, the hope being less time swiping and paying for rides will translate to shorter lines and waits, and less close contact during the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mdtRa"&gt;That’s all fine and good, at least conceptually. The relative convenience biometric recognition can add to payment systems is a concept that’s currently being floated in the US through Amazon One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;the shipping giant’s palm recognition tech&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; notes, Moscow’s Department of Information Technology claims &lt;a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5030021"&gt;photographs collected through official channels won’t be turned over to the police&lt;/a&gt; and are instead securely encrypted in the GIS ETSHD system (Moscow’s Unified Data Storage and Processing Center).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ktyfCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not hard to imagine the metro system turning into a valuable surveillance tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bZyTC"&gt;That hasn’t convinced Russian privacy advocates, though. “This is a dangerous new step in Russia’s push for control over its population. We need to have full transparency on how this application will work in practice,” Stanislav Shakirov, the founder of digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “The Moscow metro is a government institution and all the data can end up in the hands of the security services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm2Z9Q"&gt;Shakirov has good reason to be concerned. Moscow’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378164/moscow-facial-recognition-cctv-arrests-crime-surveillance"&gt;implementation of facial recognition across its vast network of more than 10,000 CCTV cameras&lt;/a&gt; is more than a little scary. Worse than the possibility of abuse by local Moscow law enforcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561018/moscows-facial-recognition-system-crime-bribe-stalking"&gt;the system can apparently be hijacked&lt;/a&gt; for as little as $200 by enterprising hackers. That’s the real risk of applying facial recognition across even more of daily life in the city, not just that the government could have an easier time tracking the movements of citizens, but that the system itself is a vulnerable target for even worse abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Busta Rhymes has questions about NFTs, and he has NFTs for sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nas Performs At City Harvest Benefit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3iavKzjhlkOPfPnEsM_mqI6sY_w=/0x0:2592x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70001553/1342270247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0nBah"&gt;You can’t always take Busta Rhymes &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1699317/mayan-apocalypse-busta-rhymes/"&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/08/24/busta-rhymes-goes-on-anti-mask-rant/"&gt;you shouldn’t take his questions seriously at all&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from this morning about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; is solidly in line with the disturbing reality of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hz6zAQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SHOULD I BUY A HOUSE… or.. A LINK TO A PICTURE OF A PIXELATED MONKEY&lt;/p&gt;— Busta Rhymes (@BustaRhymes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1448979255807946755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cmvUjv"&gt;I won’t give you, or Busta, any help with your investment or trading decisions. However, understanding that some NFTs are a link to a picture on a server &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726556/signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-nft-whim-change-platform-shit-emoji-fragility"&gt;that could change or disappear&lt;/a&gt; is information worth knowing before you spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency on a digital collectible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs0KLv"&gt;And yes, Busta Rhymes is talking about crypto and NFTs for the same reason almost anyone else is. Just like every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725019/fox-maskverse-masked-singer-nft-community-blockchain-collectables"&gt;TV network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;sports league&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22705818/dc-free-superhero-nfts-register-fandome-event"&gt;comic book publisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1443714943086366721"&gt;he has a few of them for sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix just fired the organizer of the trans employee walkout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj54EgP9dAwP8AGQkM1a1fcVMmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000779/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lfxHM"&gt;Netflix has fired a leader of the trans employee resource group who was organizing the upcoming October 20th walkout. The employee, who is Black and currently pregnant, asked not to be named for fear of online harassment. They have been encouraging trans employees and allies to walk out of work in protest of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix’s handling of the Dave Chappelle special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The employee declined to speak to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41xJf"&gt;“All these white people are going around talking to the press and speaking publicly on Twitter and the only person who gets fired is the Black person who was quiet the entire time,” says a former employee in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s absurd, and just further shows that Black trans people are the ones being targeted in this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgBrDn"&gt;The employee was terminated on suspicion of leaking metrics to the press related to the Dave Chappelle special. Those metrics — about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;and how many people it reached — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;subsequently ended up in a report on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the employee had shared the metrics internally, they spoke out against the leaks to colleagues, worried they might hurt the walkout movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzbWk7"&gt;The leaking of internal data is highly unusual at Netflix. While the company prides itself on transparency, employees are told that the culture can only thrive when Netflix data remains internal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvHqbQ"&gt;A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the employees’ dismissal. “We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” they said. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZv8uc"&gt;Controversy surrounding &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which was widely criticized by trans activists for being transphobic, has roiled Netflix in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;The company suspended Terra Field&lt;/a&gt;, a trans software engineer who posted a viral tweet thread about the controversy, for attending a director-level meeting to which she wasn’t invited. Field has since been reinstated. The company is now sending employees details about what meetings they’re allowed to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lhxtB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQwrFGXtUrMP0sAp8zX80GVAeBc=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000611/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVcxLA"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value. But Steam could also be avoiding controversy with the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkI3KB"&gt;Looking at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210826165938/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;a Wayback Machine capture of the rule page from late August&lt;/a&gt;, there are only 12 rules and no mention of cryptocurrencies or NFTs. The new rule is also missing from other documents — it currently doesn’t show up on the &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/"&gt;Joining the Steamworks Distribution Program page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMxaqo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Steam's point of view is that items have value and they don't allow items that can have real-world value on their platform. While I respect their choice, I fundamentally believe that NFTs and blockchain games are the future. It's why I started this journey with all of you.&lt;br&gt;3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Age of Rust (@SpacePirate_io) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AOvwC"&gt;Steam has a history of making controversial moderation decisions, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17417790/steam-pornography-rules-guidelines-porn-visual-novels"&gt;when it comes to games with sexual content&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, though, it doesn’t seem like people are pressing F to pay respects to NFT games — a majority of the replies and quote tweets to SpacePirate’s tweets are praising Valve for the move (or mocking those that are upset about it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52ry6n"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. We also didn’t immediately receive a response when we reached out to one of its competitors, Epic Games, to see if it had any rules around NFT / crypto games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m9r447"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2XNch"&gt;It’s perhaps understandable why Steam would want to avoid having NFTs on its platform. Besides the justification cited by SpacePirate that they could have real-world value (which seems a bit weak, given the massive commercial communities around things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/14/12186584/valve-gambling-statement-counter-strike"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/em&gt; hats), NFT and crypto-based games don’t have the best reputations. There’s the infamous Evolved Apes saga where a developer sold NFTs with the promise that they’d be included in a fighting game but then &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dyem/investors-spent-millions-on-evolved-apes-nfts-then-they-got-scammed"&gt;seemingly took the money and ran&lt;/a&gt;. There are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;potentially interesting game concepts that use NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to say how many of them would’ve been a good fit for Steam even if they were allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2VLSl"&gt;While Steam is one of the most well-known PC game stores, it’s not the only one. Developers may not have much more luck with some of its bigger competitors, though — Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s unclear whether that just applies to the games Epic makes or its store as well. I reached out to Sweeney to ask but didn’t immediately receive a reply. It’s likely, though, that any platform or store that moderates content will have to make a decision about whether it wants to allow apps or games to sell NFTs — one of the biggest question marks right now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448054684128878592"&gt;may be Apple&lt;/a&gt; and how it handles apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684372/opensea-app-nft-ios-android-apple-google"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723131/coinbase-nfts-crypto-marketplace"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; should they decide to start letting users buy the digital tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removed a popular Quran app in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fr6SfD1_9WZ82v4l6sH0JHOyxoI=/180x0:2574x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000499/Screen_Shot_2021_10_15_at_10.07.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pakistan Data Management Services&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N1lmKj"&gt;Apple has removed &lt;a href="https://quranmajeed.app/"&gt;Quran Majeed&lt;/a&gt;, a popular app for reading and listening to the Quran, from the App Store in China, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230"&gt;the BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly removed the app at the request of government officials, a somewhat surprising move given Islam is a protected religion in the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVvcIw"&gt;Quran Majeed is available for free and “recognized by 25 million Muslim users around the world” &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id365557665"&gt;according to the app’s developer&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan Data Management Services. The app’s removal apparently had nothing to do with its religious content, “according to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal,” the developer told the BBC. The developer says it’s now attempting to resolve the issue with China’s Cyberspace Administration. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both Apple and China’s US Embassy for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cGVML3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How China complicates Apple’s chest-thumping about privacy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TcFlQv"&gt;Without clearer explanation, the move seems like a possible overreach, though it does fall within &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf"&gt;Apple’s official stance on human rights abroad (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HC0Pmo"&gt;We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward. With dialogue, and a belief in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our users—their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and helpful technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k2v4Kb"&gt;While it’s logical for business, that framing has placed the company in questionable positions before. Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html"&gt;removed VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; that allowed Chinese users to avoid censorship and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-privacy-censorship.html"&gt;proactively filtered out apps&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama, or Taiwanese and Tibetan independence. Apple’s suppliers in the region &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;have also been connected&lt;/a&gt; to the oppression of China’s predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5wah6"&gt;Apple is in a difficult situation either way. It relies on the business relationships and sales it makes in China. Taking a strong stance against the government could put that in jeopardy. Just this week, Microsoft made the decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726189/microsoft-linkedin-china-censorship-shut-down"&gt;to shut down the local Chinese version of LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging separately that it is becoming increasingly difficult to comply with the Chinese government’s demands. Apple hasn’t yet found that line for itself, and with how much it relies on China to make its iPhone business work, it might not happen anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is salty about Pixel’s switch to Tensor but really shouldn’t be</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jtps-yBH1njQApS6SOZjpkkEdCY=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000489/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbRw0I"&gt;The Google Pixel 6 phones will ditch Snapdragon chips for an in-house design, and Qualcomm is clearly feeling a little hurt about it. Qualcomm couldn’t help but throw some shade at Google — in the form of a red flag meme on Twitter (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/15/qualcomm-google-tensor-snapdragon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"&gt;Google revealed its Tensor chip&lt;/a&gt;, which will make a proper debut at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Pixel 6 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. This marks the end of an era where Pixel phones — and most of Google’s earlier Nexus line — relied on Snapdragon SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8j0N8"&gt;The red flag meme started as a way to identify silly “warning signs” when dating but has since evolved to the point where it can apply to almost anything. Qualcomm came up with this questionable take on the meme, implying that Google’s choice to swap out the Snapdragon for the Tensor was a poor decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rxINZh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"We've decided to make our own smartphone SoC instead of using Snapdragon"                      &lt;/p&gt;— Snapdragon (@Snapdragon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1448317606365179906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ItrR5a"&gt;But the reality is that most Pixel users see the Tensor as something bringing exciting improvements to the device. When we got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;sneak peek at the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, Google showed off the benefits of a chip designed to make AI and machine learning processes more efficient. During the demo, we saw how the Pixel 6 could correct blurry photos, shoot better videos, and accurately transcribe speech to text — all features Google credits to the new Tensor chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IadzQ"&gt;Twitter users posted scathing replies to Qualcomm’s tweet, pointing out that, thanks to the Tensor, Pixel users will also no longer have to deal with the limited support period for Qualcomm chipsets. A recent leak suggests the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;Pixel 6 series will receive five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;, which should help extend the life of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptxzj5"&gt;Couple that with the fact that, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;points out, Google is one of Qualcomm’s smaller customers, and Qualcomm’s tweet becomes laughable. Qualcomm still provides chips for some of the biggest smartphone manufacturers, including Samsung, which &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266220/global-smartphone-market-share-by-vendor-in-2007-and-2008/"&gt;sold 17 percent of all smartphones globally&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rolls out Safety Score-based insurance product in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model S redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0zzBFMFcccqSxS0AICt3YFQ9Lg=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000355/MS_Performance_Hero_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYOj3h"&gt;Tesla is now selling insurance to customers in Texas, two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837265/tesla-car-insurance-california-autopilot-discount"&gt;first launching the offering&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;now-former home state&lt;/a&gt; of California. But the version in Texas is different. The company says it will evaluate driving behavior in real-time using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;“Safety Score” feature&lt;/a&gt; that it recently launched to screen drivers who want to join the beta test of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hsZIn"&gt;That means drivers might wind up paying less — or more — per month based on how many forward collision warnings they rack up, how hard they brake, how “aggressively” they turn, how much distance they leave to the car in front, and whether they keep their hands on the wheel when using Autopilot. Tesla used some driving behavior metrics to develop premiums in California, but they were not real-time and relied more on &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/22/tesla-tsla-launch-in-house-insurance-program-more-states/"&gt;statistical evaluations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBhO6"&gt;The offering in Texas represents a big break from how other insurance companies arrive at their quoted premiums. Even ones that rely on data from telematics dongles plugged into a car still consider other factors like age. Tesla is, unsurprisingly, promoting those differences (via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oCYRxZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike other telematics or usage-based insurance products, Tesla does not require an additional device to be installed in your vehicle. Tesla uses specific features within the vehicle to evaluate your premium based on your actual driving. You will make monthly payments based on your driving behavior instead of traditional factors like credit, age, gender, claim history and driving records used by other insurance providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OGpjH5"&gt;The company claims owners could pay premiums that are anywhere between 20 percent and 60 percent cheaper than the competition if they opt to use Tesla’s insurance. While other insurance providers relentlessly promote that they offer lower rates to safer drivers, the new version of Tesla’s insurance product could offer the most tangible version of that promise, as long as it works as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1agon9"&gt;Tesla has been working to expand its insurance offering to other states, but CEO Elon Musk announced at the company’s recent shareholder meeting that Texas would be the first to follow California. Musk also announced at that meeting that he was relocating Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;headquarters to Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where the company has spent the last year building its next US automotive factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsDzB6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches latest crew of three en route to nation’s Tianhe space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-SPACE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbjwriLSWEK1aYDvm8FM1EZY5GQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000225/1235895621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(L to R) Ye Guangfu, Wang Yaping and Zhai Zhigang, the second crew for China’s new space station, ahead of their launch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by -/CCTV/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVjZKx"&gt;China successfully launched a new crew of three taikonauts into orbit this afternoon, sending them en route to the country’s primary space station, dubbed Tianhe. The crew will &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-shenzhou-13-astronaut-launch-webcast"&gt;meet up with the station in roughly eight hours&lt;/a&gt;, sparking a six-month stay in orbit. It’s set to be the longest mission taikonauts have ever taken in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;The three taikonauts include commander Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu, part of China’s Shenzhou 13 mission. Zhai has been to space before and even performed the first spacewalk for China back in 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. This will be Wang’s second spaceflight, and she will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOreLt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wang will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDniLS"&gt;While onboard the space station, the crew will test out technologies needed to continue construction and assembly on Tianhe. China launched the core module for Tianhe back in April, and the country plans to add two more modules to it throughout 2022. The Shenzhou 13 crew will also test out the station’s robotic arm, using it to move a spacecraft attached on one docking port to another, &lt;a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-14/Shenzhou-13-China-to-send-another-3-astronauts-to-space-on-Saturday-14lRSJXnj5C/index.html"&gt;according to CGTN&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of spacewalks are also planned to add a “robotic arm adaptor and suspension system” to help with future space station construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgJoja"&gt;This is China’s second crew to live on Tianhe long-term. The last crew of three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537815/china-rocket-launch-astronauts-crew"&gt;launched in June&lt;/a&gt; and lived on the station for three months before returning in September. Shenzhou 13 is part of 11 planned launches to fully construct the Tianhe space station by next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tether will pay $41 million over ‘misleading’ claims it was fully backed by US dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrency Illustrations As Musk Roils Crypto Market" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmksx5P5lWpchuky6NlbHQyTOdQ=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000133/1233100485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tether will be fined $41 million | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n04D5w"&gt;Tether will pay $41 million to settle allegations by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it made untrue or misleading statements when it claimed its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIisGB"&gt;The CFTC said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21"&gt;statement Friday&lt;/a&gt; that between June 2016 and February 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the cryptocurrencies markets that it had “sufficient US dollar reserves” to back every token when, in fact, its reserves were not fully backed the majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IQAJY"&gt;In addition, the CFTC said, Tether failed to disclose that it included unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets as part of its reserves, falsely telling investors it would conduct routine audits to show it maintained 100 percent of reserves at all times, even though its reserves were not audited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaWZV8"&gt;“This case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace,” acting CFTC chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzkQuR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal"&gt;Tether was investigated&lt;/a&gt; by the New York attorney general for claims about its backing, setting with the agency in February. Under the terms of that settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1TuOd"&gt;Tether said in a &lt;a href="https://tether.to/statement-on-tethers-settlement-with-the-cftc/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that the CFTC order “found no issues relating to Tether’s current operations,” adding that issues in the agency’s order were resolved when Tether updated its terms of service in February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvjPro"&gt;“As to the Tether reserves, there is no finding that tether tokens were not fully backed at all times — simply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in Tether’s name, at all times,” Tether’s statement continues. “As Tether represented in the Order, it has always maintained adequate reserves and has never failed to satisfy a redemption request.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ95HD"&gt;The inquiry by the CFTC “arose during a markedly different time in our ecosystem,” according to Tether, and dealt with challenges it says were common in the digital currency industry at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FdVJ4"&gt;Tether is a digital currency known as a stablecoin, typically backed by a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro. They’re used mainly as payment vehicles and viewed as more stable (hence the name) than other digital currencies because they’re backed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsOmDo"&gt;CFTC commissioner Dawn D. Stump said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521"&gt;concurring statement&lt;/a&gt; that she agreed with the terms of the settlement, as “there were misrepresentations regarding the assets backing Tether, specifically that the USDt tokens were backed 1-to-1 by US dollars.  The evidence establishes that this assurance provided to tether customers was not 100% true, 100% of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdsdzu"&gt;But Stump added she was concerned that the settlement might cause confusion among investors, noting that the CFTC “does not regulate stablecoins, and we do not have daily insight into the businesses” involved with stablecoins. Stump questioned whether “the actions of the CFTC in entering into this settlement with the Tether respondents create a false sense of security for those investing in stablecoins?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ymDY3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tether controversy, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="r0oK2X"&gt;The CFTC also announced Friday that Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with Tether, has been fined $1.5 million for “illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets” with Americans, in violation of the &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7380-16"&gt;terms of a 2016 order&lt;/a&gt; from the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIOYjO"&gt;In a statement, Tether said the CFTC’s findings regarding Bitfinex “relate to the timing and implementation of its ban on U.S. customers,” noting the CFTC’s order found no violations after December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLZtxe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman is getting another Fortnite comic crossover with one of the game’s most mysterious characters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioquGQUoXmBSCIuPheRwStXZYjA=/0x102:3030x2122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999934/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWjjEo"&gt;Epic and DC Comics are teaming up again for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;another crossover&lt;/a&gt; with the one-shot comic &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; #1, which will arrive in comic book stores on Tuesday, October 26th. The physical comic will also include a bonus code for a Batman Who Laughs skin (which will also be available for purchase in the in-game store) and an exclusive loading screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GezDku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XclQG7"&gt;The new comic will pick up after the six-issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; crossover comics&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. But unlike last time, where the Caped Crusader was transported to Fortnite’s uniquely violent island, in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; one-shot, the island — or at least, one of its most mysterious denizens — is coming to face off against Batman in Gotham City:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aQpNaB"&gt;Returning to Gotham City after the events of &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, Batman is faced with a new mystery and a new arrival. The Foundation, an enigmatic figure from Fortnite Island, emerges from the depths of Gotham Harbor, and the Dark Knight wants to investigate what he is doing in his city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="43VRoO"&gt;The new comic also sounds like it’ll tie even deeper into Fortnite’s burgeoning lore, given the emphasis on &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/The_Foundation"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious character who appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;during Fortnite’s season six finale event&lt;/a&gt; and helped Agent Jones contain the energy of the exploding Zero Point (that sentence won’t make any sense unless you’ve been following the increasingly elaborate storyline of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second season). The character also appeared at the bottom of a river &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lBFoxLvYHs"&gt;in the current season eight story trailer&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a return soon — which presumably will tie into the upcoming Batman comic in some fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz52BY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation #&lt;/em&gt;1 also features a unique list of creatives behind the project: it’s co-written by Epic Games’ chief creative office Donald Mustard, Christos Gage (who wrote the previous Batman/Fornite crossover comics), and Scott Snyder, best known for his elaborate &lt;em&gt;Dark Nights Metal&lt;/em&gt; Batman comics (which introduced the villainous Batman Who Laughs character).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1CWS0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
