    <title>DJI’s smartphone gimbal is now a selfie stick, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3Z3PFPKCTObUUuGfbC_Ywlnlmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829236/DJI_OM_5_Lifestyle2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="asFT8M"&gt;DJI just released the Osmo Mobile 5, a new smartphone gimbal, which includes a telescoping selfie stick (okay, sure, an “extension rod”) built right into the handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sATMHi"&gt;The OM 5 retains the same foldable design principle as its predecessors but with some minor changes. The gimbal is slightly smaller and lighter this year. And eagle-eyed users will notice the angle of the handle is more acute than before to accommodate for the 8.4-inch selfie stick. I worry it might make it less comfortable, but we won’t know until we actually check it out in person. There’s also a new button on the handle, which will let you quickly access some of the core OM 5 features. But with the changes in design, the battery life is taking a huge hit. While the OM 4 gimbal was rated for 15 hours, the OM 5 rating shrinks to six hours and 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGUg_bXzbnqf4CpCRWLYfm7zKA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832161/DJI_OM_5_Lifestyle7.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8.4-inch built-in extension rod helps you capture footage from more interesting perspectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7mmBDg"&gt;When DJI introduced the OM 4, a standout feature was the pair of magnetic mounts that made attaching your phone to the gimbal effortless. But the mounts required extra effort to work with a larger than usual phone, especially if said phone had a case on it. Now DJI is upgrading the magnetic clamp so it stretches out even further. And no, just like last year, the magnets still aren’t compatible with Apple’s proprietary MagSafe magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zBplz"&gt;OM 5 also comes with improved gimbal motors and has added a new intelligent feature — Shotguides. The OM 5 scans your surroundings and gives you up to 30 sets of tips and directions on shooting videos with this gimbal. Once you have filmed all the recommended clips, it will auto-edit them into one polished video in DJI’s Mimo app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0Bo8pq2O4tWyTs5Tk3tEvyXLH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832173/DJI_OM_5_Function4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DJI is now selling an optional magnetic clamp with built-in lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbk3dY"&gt;The rest of DJI’s other intelligent tracking features are also getting a performance upgrade. Active Track 4.0 now has improved facial recognition and facial tracking, which results in much more responsive performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux1fen"&gt;All of the other preprogrammed shooting modes from the OM 4 can also be found on the OM 5 — the Hitchcockian dolly zoom, creative CloneMe Panoramas, and my personal favorite, SpinShot. Plus other standard modes we’ve seen before such as Hyperlapse, Timelapse, and Motionlapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPJ60n"&gt;DJI’s Osmo Mobile 5 will be available in 2 colors — Athens gray and sunset white. DJI is also selling a new optional $79 accessory, the DJI Fill Light Phone Clamp, which looks like a standard magnetic clamp, but with built-in lights to help brighten up your selfies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BipsKY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10739377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZiM4j"&gt;With the release of the OM 5, the OM 4 is being renamed to OM SE, which is the same gimbal as last year, including the same old 15-hour battery life but with the upgraded magnetic clamp, all for $119. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esvg6c"&gt;Osmo Mobile 5 is available right now for $159, which is $10 more than the Osmo Mobile 4 and about $30 more than the Osmo Mobile 3 cost at launch. The OM 5 comes in one standard package with a ring holder, clamp, tripod, wrist strap, and pouch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BF7flu"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Gmail app takes calls now, too, because Google wants it to do everything</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new Gmail design, with Google Spaces" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oO1qNOmz3H1GZqWlv3dKnOLzffo=/0x10:2040x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829090/Thread_Summary___Basic_Feature_Flow___8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Gmail design, with Google Spaces.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zodOHQ"&gt;Google is announcing even more Workspace features today, part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g-suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates"&gt;cadence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307087/google-workspace-status-meet-calendar-frontline-split-screen"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575523/google-workspace-tier-us-brazil-canada-japan-mexico"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; to the company’s office and communications software suite over the past year or so. Today’s announcement is a bit of a milestone, however. Although there is still the smattering of small and coming-soon updates, the bigger change is that Gmail is getting a redesign that reveals its true nature in Google’s eyes: the central hub for every Google communication app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8ERET"&gt;To begin, Google is adding the ability to “ring” another Google user with Google Meet — but inside the Gmail mobile app, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; inside the Meet app. When the feature rolls out and turns on, your Gmail app will be able to be called just like any other VOIP app (in addition to being able to join Google Meet meetings). Google says the standalone Meet app will get the same ability to place calls, not just create group meetings, at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM6Lc7"&gt;That Gmail was the first place Google thought to put its calling feature reveals how important Gmail has become to the larger changes happening within Google Workspace. Google has not been shy about leveraging Gmail’s popularity to drive adoption of its other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTAUKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gmail has become Google’s take on Outlook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="skm4yu"&gt;Now, Gmail is essentially Google’s equivalent to Microsoft’s Outlook. It’s a central hub for multiple services. Outlook is Microsoft’s hub for email, calendar, and contacts; Gmail is Google’s hub for email, one-on-one chats, group chats, videoconferencing, and now calls. The email part of Gmail is just one tab in a group of four, next to Chat, Spaces, and Meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="if1o7i"&gt;“Spaces” is Google’s rebranding of “Rooms,” a Slack-alike product that offers group chats. With the rename, Google’s making it easier to find Spaces within a company by making them discoverable to search (as an option) and also finally adding full support for threaded messages. As with other group chat apps, threads will appear in an extra column on the right-hand side. (For those keeping count, that means a Spaces user could have up to five columns of different information on their screen at once.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqwJyJ"&gt;Google says users will be able to hide the tabs they don’t use, as before, and that the redesign is rolling out to enterprise users first, starting today. After that, it will start to appear in Gmail for regular consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO8jYt"&gt;As for the smaller updates, Google Calendar will now let you RSVP to a meeting invite with an indication of your location. Google will finally launch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;so-called “Companion mode” feature&lt;/a&gt; this November. It’s the system that has you log into a meeting on your laptop alongside the main room’s AV system, muted by default so there’s not an embarrassing audio feedback loop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4yRCvVuxfzF-wDRFcz1J5uJCYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832704/Series_One_Desk_27_on_desk.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cZeA9M"&gt;Finally, Google is expanding the “Series One” line of Google Meet-compatible hardware. Unlike “Made by Google” hardware like the Pixel, Series One devices are made by other companies to look like they fit in with Google’s design aesthetic and work primarily with Google’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULTuYW"&gt;To me, the more interesting device is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22425694"&gt;Series One Desk 27&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a touchscreen display designed primarily to serve as a Google Meet videoconferencing station, but it also has a simple USB-C port and can serve as an external monitor for a laptop. When you plug in, you can use its soundbar and 5-megapixel camera with whatever video conference app you like, as well. Google says it has an Edge TPU (a custom, Google processor) for listening to Hey Google commands, but otherwise it uses a standard Intel chip for its main functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRrGrp"&gt;It’s definitely a device meant more for corporate spaces than consumer’s homes and has a price to match: $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BurSoHGvgnU-h8oLAa5xpNFd2VE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832706/Series_One_Board_65_in_team_room.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EcrX4K"&gt;There’s also the Series One Panel 65, a TV that’s also able to take stylus input and work a little like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14873358/google-jamboard-hands-on-photos-4999-collaborative-whiteboard"&gt;Google’s own Jamboard&lt;/a&gt;. Google says both will run on Chrome OS and are “all-in-one meeting devices,” but beyond that, we don’t have a ton of specs. The devices are made by &lt;a href="https://www.avocor.com/"&gt;Avocor&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a bunch of other custom meeting devices. It will launch in 2022. Pricing is not available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cM339"&gt;Google is partnering with Cisco to ensure that hardware designed for Google Meet will be able to dial into Webex meetings and that hardware designed for Webex will be able to dial into Google Meet. As for Zoom, there’s “nothing to announce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwEEYB"&gt;There’s been more work put into Google Workspace in the past year than seems to have gone into it in the several years before that, the vast majority of it focused on communication. That’s great news for companies and consumers who use all of Workspace’s various apps. But for those of us who just want Gmail to keep being just an email app, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Series One Desk 27 is a $2,000 Google Meet machine that doubles as a laptop monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Series One Desk 27 " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SiJs4p3kHSh1MFDvZRjb1X-4WHg=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829109/Series_One_Desk_27_in_booth.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Series One Desk 27 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LqdyNA"&gt;Google is announcing two new hardware devices designed specifically to work with Google Meet and to look like Google hardware. The Series One Desk 27 and Series One Board 65 are &lt;a href="http://avocor.com/google"&gt;both made by Avocor&lt;/a&gt; but are part of the &lt;a href="https://meetingdevices.withgoogle.com/seriesone/"&gt;Series One program&lt;/a&gt; where Google specifically blesses devices that are custom-built for Meet. They even include a custom Google Edge TPU chip in addition to a more standard Intel Core i5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGRTjX"&gt;As its name implies, the Series One Desk 27 is a 27-inch display that has custom speakers, mics, a camera, and a touchscreen. In addition to using it as a standalone videoconferencing device, the Desk 27 can also be used as a laptop monitor. It has a USB-C plug on the back and when you dock in, your laptop can use its AV array for video calls and take advantage of 45W USB-C PD charging, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAnpCR"&gt;That all sounds like a work-from-home dream come true, but these are not really devices meant for consumers. Instead, Google envisions them mounted to walls in small conference rooms or sitting on open desks in an office. And like pretty much all enterprise-focused hardware, even the 27-inch model is not cheap at $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4IrXB"&gt;Unlike most enterprise-focused hardware, the Series One Desk 27 feels like it’s of a piece with Google’s recent hardware aesthetic. The curves are softened and the soundbar on the bottom is covered with fabric that would look natural sitting next to a Google Home Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the Series One Desk 27 include USB-A, HDMI-out, and USB-C" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GekzDiWDKV-9WTWXhiGDQ2Yypnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832985/Series_One_Desk_27_product_only_back_view.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports on the Series One Desk 27 include USB-A, HDMI out, and USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A102i9"&gt;Although it uses Chrome OS to power its standalone Google Meet capabilities, the Desk 27 can’t really be used as a traditional all-in-one computer. However, there is a lot of impressive technology for videoconferencing built in — compared to a typical laptop, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyVqp3"&gt;The 5-megapixel camera has a 100-degree field of view, can zoom and pan to keep subjects in focus, and also has a privacy shutter. There are eight microphones that use the TPU and Google’s AI for getting rid of ambient noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCRd2z"&gt;The display itself is a touchscreen and can also be used with the included stylus as a whiteboard. It’s a 1440p, 16:9 display that auto adjusts both color and brightness for ambient lighting conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Series One Desk 27 doubles as a laptop monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VT9E2iBCnI4B_8Dy2BT-ih7ex6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832988/Series_One_Desk_27_on_desk.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series One Desk 27 doubles as a laptop monitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3VxP6r"&gt;Alongside both this hardware and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22425389"&gt;other Google Workspace announcements&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it has a partnership with Cisco that should mean hardware designed for either Meet or Webex will interoperate. So the Series One Desk 27 will be able to dial into Webex calls and Webex-specific hardware should be able to dial into Google Meet. As for Zoom, there’s nothing to announce beyond what’s sitting next to the device’s ethernet and HDMI-out ports: that USB-C port which turns the Desk 27 into an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlfb8r"&gt;Even with its special speakers, mics, and camera, it’s too expensive for consumers. But for businesses that have adopted Google Meet company-wide, it might be worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jWqyl"&gt;The Series One Desk 27 should be available later this year, while the larger Series One Board will come out next year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Series One Board 65 is coming out next year; there is no pricing information available yet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JU2s6bTySiJoBKL6RkxywGo_2UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833026/Series_One_Board_65_product_only_front.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series One Board 65 is coming out next year; there is no pricing information available yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Theranos’ greatest invention was Elizabeth Holmes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQasuZKWvctMHQ5xE8JQLX_l2nM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828969/acastro_210907_4742_Holmes_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Holmes was where the girlboss met Silicon Valley founder worship&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="e8SkvG"&gt;When I say “Elizabeth Holmes,” a character probably comes to mind: wispy bleach-blonde hair, black turtleneck, thin, white, unusually low voice, unblinking gaze. In most of her magazine covers, she’s holding a tiny vial meant to contain the “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;few drops of blood&lt;/a&gt;” needed for her company’s finger-prick blood tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vhC8S"&gt;“When I finally connected with what Elizabeth fundamentally is, I realized that I could have just as well been looking into the eyes of a Steve Jobs or a Bill Gates,” Theranos advisor Channing Robertson, a Stanford chemical engineering professor, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. “She has sometimes been called another Steve Jobs, but I think that’s an inadequate comparison,” former defense secretary and Theranos board member William Perry &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the same year. (Perry knew Jobs.) “She has a social consciousness that Steve never had. He was a genius; she’s one with a big heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YxCtx5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I literally designed my whole life for this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWaxyZ"&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; article, Holmes tells journalist Roger Parloff that she tests a drop of her own blood on a slide after a meal — claiming she can tell the difference between someone who had a healthy dinner and someone who had a cheeseburger. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html"&gt;She told &lt;em&gt;Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that she didn’t date and hadn’t taken a vacation for all of her 20s. “I literally designed my whole life for this,” she said — in what the article describes as “a strikingly baritone voice.” She only stops working to go for seven-mile runs, she told Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, spouse of Silicon Valley VC Marc Andreesen, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/12/t-magazine/elizabeth-holmes-tech-visionaries-brian-chesky.html"&gt;in a piece for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; T Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="i7lDvW"&gt;Before &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;John Carreyrou’s exposé&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Theranos was valued at $9 billion. Now Holmes is facing 10 counts of wire fraud, along with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZB9X8Z"&gt;The character seems to be precision-engineered to appeal to Silicon Valley’s vision of itself. It’s not clear who &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; the character of Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius — Holmes herself or, as she is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646130/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;expected to allege in court&lt;/a&gt;, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, former president and COO of Theranos and her former boyfriend. In some sense it doesn’t matter. Whoever created the character, it continues to loom large over Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNtpdG"&gt;In retrospect, Theranos had only a few innovations. First, Theranos exploited a regulatory loophole for its tests — marketing them as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2015/11/11/9706356/fda-theranos-health-diagnostics-cancer-tests-regulation-loophole-ldt"&gt;“laboratory-developed tests,”&lt;/a&gt; which meant Theranos didn’t have to submit data to the US Food and Drug Administration before using the tests on patients. (Theranos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2015/11/11/9706356/fda-theranos-health-diagnostics-cancer-tests-regulation-loophole-ldt"&gt;is not the only company to do this&lt;/a&gt;.) Second, the invention of Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius, aimed with exquisite accuracy at getting the maximum amount of money out of people who were accustomed to investing in tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="I9auI1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Holmes persona checked off boxes that Silicon Valley’s startup world loves to fawn over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVniq"&gt;The Holmes persona checked off boxes that Silicon Valley’s startup world loves to fawn over. Dropout from a prestigious school? Check. Obsessed with work, to the point of having no personal life? Check. Under the age of 32? Check. (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/y-combinator-silicon-valleys-start-up-machine.html"&gt;Paul Graham in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, describing what Silicon Valley VCs look for: “The cutoff in investors’ heads is 32.” Also: “I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg.”) Only hobby is exercise? Check. Steve Jobs worship? Check. Unnecessary secrecy around your innovation? In tech, secrecy around new inventions is the norm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIARKi"&gt;What’s interesting about the Elizabeth Holmes character is how she fit in with this founder myth, since she was, you know, female. But a specific kind of woman: low voice, only wears pants, high-neck shirt, clumsy makeup. &lt;em&gt;Not like those other girls&lt;/em&gt;. She began to grace magazine covers during a period shortly after Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg published &lt;em&gt;Lean In&lt;/em&gt;, a misguided book about how the solution to misogyny is simply working harder, and around the time Sophia Amoruso published &lt;em&gt;Girlboss, &lt;/em&gt;a 2014 book about founding an online discount clothing store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvdGZh"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Lean In &lt;/em&gt;/ girlboss period was a kind of response to tech’s image as a bunch of smelly bros in hoodies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142081/susan-fowler-uber-whistleblower-interview-silicon-valley-discrimination-harassment"&gt;Conditions on the ground for lower-level engineers&lt;/a&gt; were often full of sexual harassment. What’s more, women rarely got money: in 2019, 2.8 percent of VC funds went to female founders, &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020"&gt;an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;. These are large, systemic issues! And rather than talk about them, the corporate world elected to bring us &lt;em&gt;inspiration&lt;/em&gt;, as though the only thing stopping women from building their own CEO destinies was a lack of role models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="7h5ndJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe there's a special place in history for women helping other women. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ironsisters?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ironsisters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STEM?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#STEM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/eDefBtcSdD"&gt;http://t.co/eDefBtcSdD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Holmes (@eholmes2003) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eholmes2003/status/654314748394082304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2015&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n99EpY"&gt;And then there was Holmes. She was, conveniently, a woman succeeding in Silicon Valley, a place some people had suggested was possibly sexist due to things such as Paul Graham’s aforementioned Zuckerberg comment, Ellen Pao’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8328115/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-venture-capital-verdict"&gt;lawsuit against VC firm Kleiner Perkins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/uber-cab-confessions"&gt;Travis Kalanick’s “boober” incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9X2e6n"&gt;Theranos had just come out of stealth mode in 2013. Never mind that Holmes’ company was medical — her mythos was pure founder gold and tech money, like that of Larry Ellison of Oracle and Tim Draper of DFJ, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/silicon-valley-s-hypocrisy-over-elizabeth-holmes"&gt;was backing her&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a lot easier to write about people who have already made themselves into characters, since they’ve selected the signifying details for you in advance. Most readers generally like &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; and prefer these kooky founders to tedious explanatory paragraphs which may involve jargon. In her &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;profile, Holmes’ quotes are primarily big-vision stuff. There are brief references to automation and lab-on-a-chip technology, but when it comes time to explain how her tech works, she drops some real &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;-sounding nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPJqNW"&gt;“A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.” She added that, thanks to “miniaturization and automation, we are able to handle these tiny samples.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebrX23"&gt;No self-respecting soap opera about doctors would be this vague. This is the hand-wavey stuff of science fiction, where you need to have something appropriately sciencey-sounding but also move the plot along. Still, Theranos got one FDA approval in 2015: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/startup-theranos-cleared-by-fda-for-fingerprick-herpes-test?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;a test for herpes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puzGxc"&gt;Less than a year after this nonsense quote, Carreyrou &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;published his exposé&lt;/a&gt;. Theranos wasn’t using its own chemistry to perform chemical reactions to generate signals from the chemical interactions with the sample. It was doing most of its testing on machines made by its fuddy-duddy non-tech competitors. And employees didn’t think the Theranos machine, which was of course named Edison, gave accurate results. Theranos’ response was total denial of the reports, and for a while, many people gave Holmes the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eP1UoJ"&gt;The hits kept coming: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-found-at-theranos-lab-1453684743"&gt;Theranos’ labs weren’t up to par&lt;/a&gt;, partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11919874/walgreens-ends-theranos-blood-testing-partnership"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; dissolved, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-inspectors-call-theranos-blood-vial-uncleared-medical-device-1445967607"&gt;the FDA objected to Theranos’ vials&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;Theranos tossed two years’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of test results. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-executive-sunny-balwani-to-depart-amid-regulatory-probes-1463015943"&gt;Theranos’ president and COO Balwani left&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;the company finally went bust in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7hki6"&gt;Holmes’ fall from grace was the first crack in the founder myth. It was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick.html"&gt;Travis Kalanick being booted from Uber&lt;/a&gt; over the culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and general lawlessness he’d built. More flamboyantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585805/adam-neumann-cult-of-we-wework-book-vc"&gt;Adam Neumann of WeWork&lt;/a&gt; was forced out after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;filed frankly deranged paperwork&lt;/a&gt; for its IPO, which was then called off. Those three founders had borrowed the notes of tech hype for products that were, well, not tech: Theranos was (at least in theory) medicine, Uber is a car service with a nice app, and WeWork is a real estate company. During this heady period, though, investors tended to overlook tech-hyped things that weren’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LGFvkk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Do you think she’ll use &lt;em&gt;the voice&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXDi1I"&gt;Holmes’ mythos helped smooth out any cognitive dissonance that might have occurred on the part of investors who may have otherwise wondered why the board — which contained dignitaries such as former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz and James Mattis, who later became Donald Trump’s secretary of defense — didn’t have anyone on it with experience in diagnostics. Nor were there any experts on the regulatory hoop-jumping required for marketing approval from the FDA. Who needs &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyatarr/2019/03/26/here-are-the-real-lessons-learned-from-elizabeth-holmess-failure/?sh=1cc5898a198b"&gt;due diligence&lt;/a&gt; when the founder has such a convincing personal story? Besides, a lot of important people vouched for her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG2o6J"&gt;Part of the appeal of the Holmes trial, then, is finding out how closely the Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius character resembles the actual person, Elizabeth Holmes, daughter of a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/02/17/4-startling-insights-into-elizabeth-holmes-from-psychiatrist-whos-known-here-since-childhood/"&gt;former Enron executive&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, whether Holmes’ deep voice is real is &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/why-did-elizabeth-holmes-use-a-fake-deep-voice.html"&gt;a subject of actual debate&lt;/a&gt;. Every time I tell someone I plan to cover the trial, the person replies “Do you think she’ll use &lt;em&gt;the voice?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RR8zsH"&gt;At stake in the trial is whether Holmes and Balwani deceived investors. In &lt;em&gt;The Inventor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley"&gt;the lackluster documentary about Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, director Alex Gibney gives a lot of play to the idea that deceiving investors is a normal part of Silicon Valley — fake it til you make it! The documentary’s explanation relies on Daniel Ariely, a psychologist whose expertise is lying and who is now &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/dan-ariely-honesty-study-retraction"&gt;embroiled in a fake-data controversy&lt;/a&gt;. In the movie, Ariely suggests that Holmes may have fooled herself, in addition to her investors. (It’s not illegal to be stupidly optimistic, just stupid.) This is the ideal line for Holmes, because the prosecution has to show that Holmes &lt;em&gt;knowingly &lt;/em&gt;deceived investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="RKCK19"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes’ marketing as Girl Genius was too good, and now other women are compared to her because there aren’t enough famous startup women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUsuqC"&gt;That “knowingly” part is the hardest thing to prove, and that’s where the prosecution will have to work. There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of texts and emails between Balwani and Holmes. Holmes’ team has fought, so far unsuccessfully, to keep them from being presented to the jury as evidence for her state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEPDVo"&gt;But Holmes may be poised to argue she’s not so close to the Elizabeth Holmes character she portrayed after all. Her lawyers &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;may say at trial&lt;/a&gt; that the character — and any deception associated with Theranos — was the result of abuse that impaired her judgment; the filings note that Balwani is 20 years older than her and claim that he controlled how she ate, dressed, and slept, as well as overseeing her texts and phone calls. They may even call an expert witness, Mindy Mechanic, to bolster these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqxDkv"&gt;If this is true, Holmes’ girlboss persona, which was marketed to women as inspiration, may actually be the creation of an abusive boyfriend. To back this up, Holmes might behave &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;differently in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAs13Y"&gt;But it also means that Holmes’ defense is arguing that she was just a prop for Balwani’s scheme — that Holmes actually had no agency. Holmes was just a helpless woman, see, and thus she can’t be held responsible. It’s not the first time Holmes has defended herself by relying on tropes about women, either. In 2015, she implied Carreyrou’s investigation was a witch hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="qT4iKf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Thankfully its not the 16 hundreds, or else we’d be burned at the stake!” - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eholmes2003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@eholmes2003&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIS2015?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MIS2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Theranos (@theranos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theranos/status/658802936013811712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2015&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEGI6g"&gt;The trial of Holmes — and later, Balwani — may help us settle who created Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius, since whoever it is may very well go to jail. Holmes’ defense could also create one more unpleasant surprise for women in the Valley. If her abuse accusation isn’t judged credible, that will likely make it even harder for women in tech experiencing abuse and harassment to be believed. As impossible as it might sound, she can actually still make things worse for other women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HrjLqh"&gt;Regardless of who invented the character, the Elizabeth Holmes persona damaged other women. Women in the diagnostics space report having an even higher bar to clear to get funding because of Theranos. Female founders in biotech and medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/technology/theranos-elizabeth-holmes.html"&gt;can’t escape questions about Holmes&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t matter that they’re not doing the same thing — Holmes’ marketing as Girl Genius was too good, and now other women are compared to her because there aren’t enough famous startup women. Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius, is an awfully memorable character, after all. Isn’t that why she was created in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s cashierless tech is coming to Whole Foods next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbOP2y8VFHhvaOHuqnDmkK3OSXk=/0x0:1113x742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828953/ezgif.com_gif_maker.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lpYqzJ"&gt;Amazon is bringing its cashierless “Just Walk Out” technology to two new Whole Foods locations next year, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/whole-foods-market-to-launch-just-walk-out-technology-at-two-locations"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. One of the stores will be in Washington, DC, while the second will be in Sherman Oaks, California. When they’re open, customers will have the option of paying at a traditional self-checkout or customer service booth, or having the new technology automatically bill them when they leave the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye0eCG"&gt;The move marks Amazon’s latest step towards scaling its cashierless technology, which works by using a series of cameras and sensors to automatically detect what people pick up off shelves, into a variety of larger stores. Just Walk Out originally debuted in small &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/21/16913984/what-does-photos-amazon-jeff-bezos-seattle-new-no-cashier-line-grocery-story-amazon-go"&gt;Amazon Go convenience stores&lt;/a&gt;, before the company scaled it up to work in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;bigger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534570/amazon-fresh-full-size-grocery-store-just-walk-out-cashierless-technology-bellevue-washington"&gt;bigger&lt;/a&gt; grocery stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SZhXHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Customers will need an Amazon account to use Just Walk Out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pz3ZZh"&gt;Amazon says its technology will support all of Whole Foods’ selection, including self-service orange juice and mochi ice cream “without adjusting any shopping habits.” It adds that the Whole Foods stores will have a “comparable” number of team members to similar sized stores, but that they’ll spend their time differently as a result of the cashierless technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbkOdh"&gt;To start cashierless shopping, customers can scan a QR code in the Whole Foods or Amazon app, insert a credit or debit card linked to their Amazon account, or scan their palm using the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One technology&lt;/a&gt; (which it has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395441/amazon-one-palm-scanning-payments-whole-foods-seattle"&gt;tested in Whole Foods locations&lt;/a&gt; as a way of speeding up the checkout process). A digital receipt is provided after you leave the store. Customers will need an Amazon account to use Just Walk Out, and will have to use a self-checkout lane if they want to pay with cash, debit or credit cards, or gift cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0dzjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>News sites are liable for defamatory Facebook comments, rules Australia’s High Court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWyXPE1MAUjANCa3VNltBUWAf40=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828880/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTAKge"&gt;Media companies in Australia can be held responsible for defamatory comments left on their social media pages by members of the public, the country’s High Court has ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcgUg"&gt;The decision is part of a long-running defamation case that could have huge consequences for Australia’s media industry, forcing news sites to strictly moderate or remove comments on stories shared on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/high-court-rules-media-are-liable-for-facebook-comments-on-their-stories-heres-what-that-means-for-your-favourite-facebook-pages-167435"&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, David Rolph, a professor of law at the University of Sydney, said the ruling “may mean anyone who runs a social media page can theoretically be sued over disparaging comments posted by readers or random group members — even if you aren’t aware of the comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d4oViw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anyone who runs a social media page can theoretically be sued over disparaging comments”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="plQA79"&gt;The ruling (which can be read in full &lt;a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA//2021/27.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is part of a defamation lawsuit brought against a number of outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, by Australia’s Dylan Voller. Shocking photographs of Voller being &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-25/four-corners-evidence-of-kids-tear-gas-in-don-dale-prison/7656128"&gt;restrained at a youth detention center&lt;/a&gt; went viral in 2016 and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/don-dale-no-charges-to-be-laid-over-royal-commission-findings"&gt;led to an inquest&lt;/a&gt; into the conditions at such centers. Many news outlets covered the story and shared their articles on Facebook. In 2017, Voller sued three of these companies, arguing that comments left on their Facebook pages in reaction to these stories were defamatory, and that, by inviting these comments, the news outlets were legally their publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDxyL"&gt;It’s this second point which has proved particularly contentious, but a number of courts have found in favor of Voller’s argument. These include the Supreme Court of New South Wales &lt;a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2019/766.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and the New South Wales Court of Appeal &lt;a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2020/102.html"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This latest ruling, a 5-2 decision by Australia’s High Court, seems to settle this particular element of the case, establishing that media companies are indeed the “publishers” of third-party Facebook comments and can be held legally responsible for their content. However, Voller still has to prove that the comments themselves were defamatory, while media companies can now marshal new defenses under defamation law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYhkey"&gt;Although Voller’s case is not yet over, Australian media companies are extremely worried by the wider implications of the High Court’s ruling. A spokesperson for Nine, one of the companies sued by Voller, &lt;a href="https://www.mediaweek.com.au/high-court-rules-media-outlets-could-be-liable-for-facebook-comments/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the decision “will have ramifications for what we can post on social media in the future.” Michael Miller, executive chairman at News Corp Australia, another firm targeted in the case, said the finding “highlights the need for urgent legislative reform” that will “bring Australian law into line with comparable western democracies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGmnnv"&gt;As Miller noted in comments &lt;a href="https://www.mediaweek.com.au/high-court-rules-media-outlets-could-be-liable-for-facebook-comments/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;MediaWeek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The decision by the High Court in the Voller case is significant for anyone who maintains a public social media page by finding they can be liable for comments posted by others on that page even when they are unaware of those comments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F61ygY"&gt;The ruling may even effect individuals posting on personal social media pages, said Rolph in &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/media-outlets-lose-high-court-appeal-over-facebook-defamation-ruling-20210908-p58prh.html"&gt;comments to &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The decision “obviously has implications for ordinary users of social media platforms, because they can be held liable as publishers where they post material to their Facebook pages and encourage engagement,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD4MRW"&gt;Media companies argued that they could not be the publishers of Facebook comments as they were unaware of their content. “To be a publisher, one must intend to communicate the matter complained of,” they wrote in a submission from&lt;a href="https://cdn.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/08-Sydney/s236-2020/FairfaxMedia_NationwideNews_AustralianNews-Voller_App.pdf"&gt; February 2021&lt;/a&gt;. They also noted that at the time of the lawsuit, Facebook didn’t allow publishers to turn off comments underneath posts at all (the company &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/31/facebook-turn-off-comments-on-post-limit-restrict-disable-comment-posts-moderation-control-tool"&gt;only added this feature&lt;/a&gt; in March this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3wdf2"&gt;The High Court &lt;a href="https://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2021/HCA/27"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; by noting that when media companies created and maintained public Facebook pages they were showing their “intentional participation in the process” of sharing third-party comments. “[T]he appellants’ attempt to portray themselves as passive and unwitting victims of Facebook’s functionality has an air of unreality,” wrote two of the justices, Stephen Gageler and Michelle Gordon, in a judgement. “Having taken action to secure the commercial benefit of the Facebook functionality, the appellants bear the legal consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qm3kHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;National regulations can have a global impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDP7Xg"&gt;A big question is what effect this ruling will have on the operations of media companies in other parts of the world. Thanks to the internet’s global reach, rulings in one nation can quickly have a knock-on effect internationally, and in the US, there are already huge debates about whether websites should be held liable for what users post (arguments which often revolve around the all-important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K56tkB"&gt;It’s important also that Australia is often seen as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22332149/atlassian-ceo-scott-farquhar-interview-tech-regulation-internet"&gt;test bed for online regulation&lt;/a&gt;, able to enact sweeping changes that have a big effect on how companies operate online. Earlier this year, for example, the country’s competition watchdog &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;forced tech companies&lt;/a&gt; to pay Australian media companies to use their content, leading Facebook to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;block all Australian users&lt;/a&gt; from sharing news articles on the site. In this particular case, the law &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22287971/australia-facebook-news-ban-google-money"&gt;was later changed&lt;/a&gt; and old functionality resumed, but it demonstrates how quickly what we think of as the normal operating standards of the internet can be altered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jTIoA"&gt;With this High Court ruling, comment sections in Australia may simply be seen as too costly to moderate and so turned off for good. However, &lt;a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2021/australia/a-national-reset-begins"&gt;recent changes to de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediawrites.law/a-national-reset-begins-defamation-law-reforms-come-into-effect-in-nsw-victoria-and-south-australia/"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2021/australia/a-national-reset-begins"&gt;amation law &lt;/a&gt;in the country, which came into effect in some states on July 1st, have raised the barrier for defamation suits, and could potentially act as a counterweight to the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota says it’s investing $13.6B in car batteries over the next decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJCC3LGMHVKCumVEiHZO32IyQnA=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828778/20210419_01_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyota’s electric BZ4X SUV concept.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Toyota&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vHJuns"&gt;Toyota will invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-to-spend-9-billion-on-electric-car-battery-plants-11631020016?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It reportedly plans to have 10 battery production lines by 2025, eventually increasing to around 70 across an unannounced number of factories around the world. Eventually, it could produce as much as 200GWh of batteries, the company’s chief technology officer, Masahiko Maeda, announced in a &lt;a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35971839.html"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTKYz0"&gt;Toyota’s commitments mirror similar investments planned by others across the auto industry. Volkwagen plans to produce around 240GWh of batteries in Europe alone by 2030, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;Ford has said&lt;/a&gt; it plans to produce 240GWh globally by then, including 140GWh in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4kB4S"&gt;It’s a big investment from Toyota, and indicates the world’s largest car manufacturer by volume is getting more serious about electrifying its lineup. Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, it reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZICnG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We aim to reduce the battery cost per vehicle by 50 percent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iczbRt"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;Toyota announced an electric vehicle strategy&lt;/a&gt; that will see it release 70 electric cars globally by 2025, including 15 fully-electric vehicles as well as hybrids and hydrogen-powered models. As part of the strategy it announced the BZ4X concept electric SUV, which it hopes to release in China and Japan starting later this year. By 2030, the company wants around 80 percent of its cars to include some kind of battery power, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOhmnR"&gt;Toyota hopes that its investments can help to reduce the cost of batteries by 30 percent thanks to improvements in materials and cell designs. On the vehicle side it’s also aiming to develop cars that use batteries more efficiently, resulting in 30 percent less energy consumed per kilometer. “Through this integrated development of vehicles and batteries, we aim to reduce the battery cost per vehicle by 50 percent compared to the Toyota BZ4X in the second half of the 2020s,” Maeda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nagAf"&gt;The company is also continuing its work on solid-state batteries, which could eventually lead to more densely packed, safer, and faster charging cells, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-spend-over-135-bln-ev-batteries-by-2030-2021-09-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Toyota hopes to begin manufacturing these batteries by the middle of the decade, but admits there’s still research to be done to improve the cost and lifespan of the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IeVpO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCqc4D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMXQfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new dock is designed for a work from home world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rE3vGpasovXPCkk531ttmN49vbw=/151x0:1780x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828769/High_Resolution_PNG_Logi_Dock_Desktop_Enviro_Graphite_FRONT.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pTCtVj"&gt;Logitech is announcing a new all-in-one dock that’s designed for the new realities of a post-pandemic hybrid workforce. “When the pandemic hit, we spent an incredible amount of time with our end users to understand their needs and pain points in a work-from-home world. The result was Logi Dock,” says Scott Wharton, general manager and vice president of Logitech video collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbDmjw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-workspaces%2Flogi-dock.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22662237%2Flogitech-logi-dock-features-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The $399 Logi Dock&lt;/a&gt; lets you connect up to five USB devices and up to two monitors, all while charging a laptop with a single cable connection. The dock itself is a giant speaker, because it’s also designed with meetings in mind. There are meeting controls on the Logi Dock that let you quickly mute or disable video in Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. Logitech has even included a built-in noise-cancelling speakerphone that makes it easy to join meetings without having to use a separate dedicated microphone or headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-R-1TOs6uPxgalJ6u1oRUi47Vww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833864/High_Resolution_PNG_Logi_Dock_FRONT_Graphite_lighting___Purple.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Logi Dock has meeting controls on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DssNrt"&gt;Logi Dock will also integrate into your calendar, thanks to Logitech’s Logi Tune software. If a meeting is about to start, the Logi Dock will light up to let you know, and you can join just by tapping the dock. If you’re not using the Logi Dock for meetings, you can also use it as a speaker for your PC or any Bluetooth-enabled device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndf4jp"&gt;The Logi Dock includes two USB-A 3.0 ports at the rear, alongside two USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a DisplayPort, a HDMI port, USB-C upstream, a Kensington lock slot, and a Bluetooth pairing button. At the side there’s also a USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGhn67"&gt;Logitech’s Logi Dock &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-workspaces%2Flogi-dock.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22662237%2Flogitech-logi-dock-features-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; in both graphite and white options this winter for $399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Clipchamp acquisition will help improve video editing on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8yDsfxmE-NdaFYxuQTDRYDfSwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828694/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YJmpiW"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Clipchamp, a browser-based video editing tool, and is hinting that it will be a great fit for Windows. Founded in 2013, Clipchamp lets people create and edit videos in a browser and utilize the full power of a GPU to render the final result. Clipchamp is used by companies like Google, Dell, and Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITTcEM"&gt;Microsoft is now looking to integrate Clipchamp into its Microsoft 365 offerings, and perhaps even Windows itself. “As a web app that uses the full power of your PC, Clipchamp is a natural fit to extend the cloud-powered productivity experiences in Microsoft 365 for individuals, families, schools, and businesses,” explains Chris Pratley, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Office media group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uNPpTY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft says Clipchamp is a great fit for Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyeBWb"&gt;Interestingly, Pratley also says “it’s a great fit for Microsoft Windows,” which suggests that Microsoft could integrate Clipchamp into Windows in the future. Clipchamp already exists as an app in the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft’s existing video editing tools for Windows are lackluster to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLCPg"&gt;Windows 11 may improve that situation, alongside the potential Clipchamp integration in the future. Windows and devices chief Panos Panay teased a new photos app for Windows 11 just minutes before the acquisition announcement, with what looks like better tools for editing photos and videos. The existing photos app in Windows 10 can edit videos, but the tools are very basic, and aren’t even close to the level of editing options available in Clipchamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q3ZCHu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pumped to share another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; first look with you - the beautifully redesigned &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhotosApp?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PhotosApp&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsInsiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hraNJAo9iF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hraNJAo9iF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1435346853365575680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1DNpyw"&gt;Clipchamp uses a combination of templates and a library of filters, transitions, stock media, and styles to let people created videos with multi-track audio support and user-friendly editing. Microsoft’s acquisition appears to be part of the company’s renewed focus on creation, and even consumer-friendly apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D58J3Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628689/microsoft-manik-gupta-hire-uber-consumer-teams-skype-groupme"&gt;Microsoft recently hired a former Uber exec&lt;/a&gt; to lead a consumer apps effort inside the company, months after CEO Satya Nadella said “the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is coming to parts of Europe on October 26th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucq85RArGZ_Ny_0GTi27GfW9Dhw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828669/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPcrax"&gt;HBO Max will launch in Europe next month on October 26th, the streaming service announced today. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra are the first six countries it’ll be available in, before it expands to the following 14 territories next year: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2khb8v"&gt;The list of territories corresponds to the regions currently covered by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Europe"&gt;HBO Europe&lt;/a&gt;, which operates a handful of different streaming services on the continent including HBO España, HBO Nordic, and HBO Go. The company has previously said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;transition its European HBO-branded services&lt;/a&gt; to HBO Max over the course of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="16o7Zx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany are absent from the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CDXPKP"&gt;Notably absent from the list are larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany. HBO has historically not operated standalone services in these countries, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-europe-rollout-plan-nordics-spain-1235005773/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, but has instead opted to license its content to local operators like Comcast-owned Sky in the UK. HBO says that “additional territory launches are also planned for next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsRuRe"&gt;“WarnerMedia movies and series like &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe,” said Head of HBO Max International Johannes Larcher. “HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.” HBO Max currently includes content from Warner Bros., HBO, DC, and Cartoon Network, as well as new content branded as Max Originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu0ZYB"&gt;HBO Max debuted in the US in May last year. In June, the streaming service launched across &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/6/29/22556006/hbo-max-launches-in-39-international-markets-outside-us"&gt;39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9jRih"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t mention how much European customers can expect to pay for the streaming service. Instead, that information will be announced in a virtual launch event planned for next month, HBO says. &lt;/p&gt;
