    <title>Streaming music report sheds light on battle between Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and Google  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlyKvNdo2QIPi4WU8-WJs6N6TqM=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411565/music_streaming_market_share.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Market share for the world’s largest music streaming services.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Midia Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y8KfeM"&gt;Spotify was the largest music streaming service in the world as of the second quarter of 2021 with a market share of 31 percent, with Apple Music in second place at 15 percent, and Amazon Music and Tencent Music each tied at third with 13 percent apiece. That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/music-subscriber-market-shares-q2-2021"&gt;report from Midia Research&lt;/a&gt;, a media and entertainment-focused research and analysis agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vazr2E"&gt;Although exact subscriber numbers and market shares may have changed in the months since Q2 2021 (the use of older data is because of how long the market analysis process takes, Midia tells me), the report sheds light on how the world’s biggest music streaming services are stacking up against one another. While Spotify releases official subscriber numbers at the end of each quarter (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746682/spotify-q3-2021-earnings-podcast-music-streaming-financials"&gt;most recently in October last year&lt;/a&gt;), competitors like Apple and Amazon are less forthcoming with exact figures, and the most recent &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/07/28/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"&gt;official figures compiled by &lt;em&gt;Music Ally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are from 2019 and 2020 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VCP899"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Amazon Music have reported market shares of 15 and 13 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tGROGm"&gt;Based on Midia’s claim that there were 523.9 million total music streaming subscribers in Q2 2021, this suggests Spotify had just over 162.4 million subscribers paying for its music streaming service (although the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596155/spotify-earnings-q2-2021-podcasting-investments-acquisitions-subscribers"&gt;official figure for Q2 was 165 million&lt;/a&gt;). Midia’s estimates would then put Apple Music at almost 78.6 million subscribers for the quarter, and Amazon Music and China-exclusive Tencent Music at a little over 68.1 million each. YouTube Music follows up in fifth place with an 8 percent market share corresponding to 41.9 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsukxG"&gt;According to Midia, the music streaming market is continuing to grow, and increased by 26.4 percent to the second quarter of last year. Although Spotify’s commanding lead means it’s unlikely to be overtaken anytime soon, Midia notes that its market share dropped from 33 percent in Q2 2020 to 31 percent in Q2 2021, and its growth was outperformed by Amazon and YouTube Music, with the latter growing by over 50 percent compared to a year earlier. Growth in emerging markets was reportedly also strong, with Yandex, Tencent, and NetEast growing by a combined 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIOwEh"&gt;Given these figures date back to the second quarter of last year, they’re unlikely to show the full impact of the lossless audio streaming changes that were made last year. Apple Music, for example, added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;lossless-quality and spatial audio streaming features in June&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;Amazon stopped charging extra for lossless streaming in May&lt;/a&gt;. However despite making a big splash with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;lossless audio announcement of its own&lt;/a&gt;, Spotify’s new Hi-Fi tier missed its planned 2021 release window.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crypto.com admits over $30 million stolen by hackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of bitcoin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-X86g3esA40PBuwSKzgPvw0R5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411559/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1QmLWm"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps/"&gt;blog post &lt;/a&gt;published in the early hours of Thursday morning, cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com acknowledged that the company had lost well over $30 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum after a hack that took place on January 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtVQDs"&gt;The company has been criticized for vague communication around the hack, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891949/crypto-ceo-confirms-hundreds-accounts-hacked-bloomberg-ethereum"&gt;only officially confirmed yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by CEO Kris Marszalek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljdoau"&gt;The new blog post said that the total value of the unauthorized withdrawals was 4,836.26 ETH and 443.93 BTC — equivalent to roughly $15.2 million and $18.6 million respectively, at current exchange rates — as well as $66,200 worth of other currencies. According to the post, 483 Crypto.com users had their accounts compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi8rXY"&gt;Crypto.com has said that all affected customers have been fully reimbursed for the losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev8V6n"&gt;The latest communication from the company provides the most insight yet into the security breach, although details of the exact method of compromise remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cH4sby"&gt;“On Monday, 17 January 2022 at approximately 12:46 AM UTC Crypto.com’s risk monitoring systems detected unauthorized activity on a small number of user accounts where transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user,” the post reads. “This triggered an immediate response from multiple teams to assess the impact. All withdrawals on the platform were suspended for the duration of the investigation. Any accounts found to be impacted were fully restored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udhlC1"&gt;As a result of the hack, the exchange has migrated its two-factor authentication system to a new architecture, and revoked all existing 2FA tokens, meaning that all customers will need to switch over to the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K2L70"&gt;The Crypto.com hack is the latest in a string of attacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, which are some of the most high-value targets in the steadily growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. In 2021 there were more than 20 exchange hacks &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/bitcoin-crypto-exchange-hacks-little-anyone-can-do-rcna7870"&gt;where the hacker escaped with more than $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in profit according to an analysis by NBC News, and six cases where the value of funds stolen exceeded $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram are reportedly exploring plans to make, showcase, and sell NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etvX5rtiaCTyUCg4JIHykXMqiMI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411423/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ygsQG"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta is exploring plans to let users create, showcase, and sell NFTs on Facebook and Instagram, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwVpv9"&gt;If the company launches such tools, it would be the biggest show of mainstream support for NFTs to date, and help solidify the controversial assets’ place in the digital world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSNC2G"&gt;As per the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, the plans are “at an early stage and could yet change.” The publication says teams at Facebook and Instagram are “readying” a feature that will let users display NFTs as their profile pictures, as well as working on a prototype to let users mint new NFTs. Others at Meta are reportedly discussing “launching a marketplace for users to buy and sell NFTs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu7AG9"&gt;Exactly how far along these plans are is impossible to say, but it’s not the first show of interest in NFTs we’ve seen from Meta’s leaders. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/instagram-currently-exploring-nfts-ceo-183537502.html?guce_referrer=ahr0chm6ly93d3cuz29vz2xllmnvbs8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=aqaaaekjfquyoqo6ejm4nkpo6ql9wubt42gt1x9bhwu6dkukkijdfpioi9ipkou3-hg2txjqjzpm0ig0xfs03d3mlcbjq8sv4zrrl2ktawdmqhg7hsn23k6-vqwykp8ev50g_jxenb5zlut9ldbmwzmhlfvecvhrjy9loianefjvxcij"&gt;said last December&lt;/a&gt; that the company is “actively exploring NFTs and how we can make them more accessible to a wider audience,” while last October Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/572525803829402/"&gt;spoke about&lt;/a&gt; how the metaverse will need to support “ownership of digital goods or NFTs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5rAxj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Web stalwarts like Reddit and Twitter have also shown interest in NFTs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt83R3"&gt;NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have been gaining support with other established web platforms in recent months. Twitter is working on ways to showcase such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744540/twitter-blockchain-linked-collectibles-tab"&gt;blockchain-supported items&lt;/a&gt;, while Reddit launched its own &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/"&gt;collection of NFT avatars for users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0sUfk"&gt;Although NFTs are much derided for their speculative value (prices rise and fall with shocking speed) and lack of security (they’re frequently stolen despite claims by some that they guarantee ownership), these assets will become more significant if existing tech giants choose to support them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HM2JYl"&gt;An NFT is, at heart, a way to claim ownership of a digital item like a JPG or a GIF via a unique address on the blockchain. And despite claims that these assets embody a decentralized forms of ownership, their legitimacy rests upon recognition from existing online platforms. If Twitter or Instagram lets anyone copy and paste your JPG of a smoking chimp, who’s to say who really owns it? But if companies start enforcing ownership rights as signified by NFTs, they could become legitimate digital assets (at least on those platforms). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J05E9"&gt;For Meta, embracing NFTs could also help it wield greater influence in what the company has labelled the metaverse — a nebulous concept of interconnected virtual worlds, similar to promises of VR universes floated in the 1990s and before. That could potentially boost the value and importance of NFTs while simultaneously centralizing control over the assets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter Communities now work on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etAeUP-_caPc9foT6JqNCspNXsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411369/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYLPuE"&gt;Twitter is rolling out its Communities feature, a rival to Facebook Groups and Reddit, to Android users worldwide. Since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;launch in September&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter Communities has been limited to iOS or the web, meaning Android users could only join and participate in communities through a browser and not the native Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFQbo5"&gt;Android users can now easily join, request to join, or participate in Twitter Communities, opening up the feature to a lot more of Twitter’s userbase. Twitter Communities work like a private group, or like a subreddit. Twitter users can choose to tweet directly to a Twitter community, and that tweet won’t show up on their own feed or to their followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aHzh8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitters Communities is still in beta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMMGDF"&gt;Twitter Communities is still an invite-only feature for those wanting to create their own private community. Group owners can choose whether people need an invite to join a community or whether they’re open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVGrQ0"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out the Twitter Communities feature, Twitter is highlighting the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1456210950697201667&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=Rqoogv5hj3GkJ0cEq4S-U7uav8wkd2DfRMfphOhuCWM&amp;amp;e="&gt;Roblox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1455305732912418820&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=M83vv79CLhSEGG9_7g2pqkisivtxcOA8SL5qJ7Eu-4w&amp;amp;e="&gt;Xbox Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1472105760389668865&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=jmUmmI7YfVP9GDEWDLpyEBJaDu9_nnKcTufoC1rpqu0&amp;amp;e="&gt;Tech Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1455315897657270281&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=v1wORJFKp8-gYXri4ARRZvCCwBA8A3THdu_mWBM3wEU&amp;amp;e="&gt;Fashion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1473375845628710916&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=H3u0iKCcwnEfiZMlk3AEJP6xVXAf2mpIQxfBBKWSjaQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;R&amp;amp;B Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_i_communities_1442988929070731268&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=Uv9qWPlVC6bLoWR3OGaRwo3ukTdrKzk8B9dOoqZh0hz6zJ26DLBV3m1ROlVaqoGC&amp;amp;s=0j4xDJNevlBE8Iq9ZEUAvintdRD7523SQWEq0G8hcps&amp;amp;e="&gt;Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; communities that are all public for anyone to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6TKnx"&gt;Twitter is also exploring a “request to join” option for communities, so groups can more closely monitor who joins a community. Alongside this new option, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HiCommunities/status/1478795193050701825"&gt;Twitter is also planning&lt;/a&gt; to test a ranked timeline that will show top tweets from a community, ways for mods to highlight content in community, and methods for Q&amp;amp;As to be held with mods or members.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s first clothing store lets you summon clothes to the fitting room  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A touchscreen in Amazon Style’s fitting room." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEWbc6GviwcZTzgk8Kr84T1Ozz0=/51x0:609x372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411286/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JBpEmM"&gt;Amazon Style is a new kind of physical store from the online shopping giant that will focus on clothing, footwear, and other fashion accessories, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-reimagines-in-store-shopping-with-amazon-style"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s due to open at The Americana at Brand shopping mall in Los Angeles later this year, where it will be Amazon’s “first-ever physical apparel store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YT49E"&gt;In line with Amazon’s existing retail locations, the new Amazon Style store is packed to the gills with shopping tech. Amazon says clothes racks will feature QR codes, which customers can scan to see available sizes, colors, customer ratings, and product details. Then, with a tap of a button, selected items will be sent to a fitting room to try on without having to first rummage through racks. Amazon will also send additional items its algorithms think you might like. A promotional video shows how Amazon’s app will alert customers when a fitting room is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yv_gzjgKsOSwtEwIZ9AzXpvE_cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181750/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_11.25.18_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video shows Amazon’s app alerting a customer when their fitting room is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1lId4P"&gt;The fitting rooms will also feature touchscreens of their own, so customers can request more items be brought to them. Items can either be purchased in store or saved to the Amazon Shopping app to buy at a later date. Alternatively, customers at home can use the app to find clothing they want, before having them delivered to the Amazon Style store to try on in person. The store will support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One&lt;/a&gt;, a technology that lets you pay for items by using the palm of your hand for identity verification. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A touchscreen in Amazon Style’s fitting room." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c760_Cb5E8zQA5r_2NjZ4uKIbgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181734/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitting rooms are equipped with touchscreens that can be used to request more clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rvl2Wc"&gt;Conspicuously absent is any mention of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology, which it’s previously used in its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869294/amazon-go-store-chicago-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534570/amazon-fresh-full-size-grocery-store-just-walk-out-cashierless-technology-bellevue-washington"&gt;Amazon Fresh&lt;/a&gt; stores, as well as an increasing number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784994/amazon-cashierless-technology-uk-customers-sainsburys"&gt;external stores&lt;/a&gt;, to allow customers to pick up items and walk out without needing to pay for them at a register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXseSW"&gt;Amazon says its new store is far more space-efficient, with Amazon Style able to offer “more than double the number of styles” as a traditional store of a similar size. But if it works, it also sounds like it could remove some of the pain points of in-store shopping, like having to awkwardly walk about a store half-clothed in search of a different size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FtD5k"&gt;Although it appears to rely heavily on automation, Amazon says its new Style store will still have traditional employees, who will be focused on customer service, delivering items to fitting rooms, helping customers at checkout, managing back-of-house, and processing payments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2wlmC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Task Manager design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-60_7eMujDpoL-DdFysOtrhvvY=/75x0:1455x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411262/unknown.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MaK7zh"&gt;Microsoft is getting ready to overhaul the Task Manager in Windows 11. Like the rest of the operating system, the Task Manager is getting a new design that matches Microsoft’s new Fluent Design language. It seems Microsoft hid the new design in the bowels of recent Windows 11 builds, but engineering student &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gus33000"&gt;Gustave Monce&lt;/a&gt;, who previously got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558999/microsoft-windows-11-windows-phone-port-developer-engineer"&gt;Windows 11 running on a phone&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered the work-in-progress and shared it on Discord this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s01iqn"&gt;It’s possible to enable the new Task Manager inside the latest preview builds of Windows 11, but Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the redesign. “This is a hidden feature in the new build,” says Monce. “Everything is broken though.” It’s clearly early days for this new design, but it already includes a dark mode and interface that closely matches the big design changes in Windows 11 — rounded corners, pastel shades, and a focus on simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yU42B"&gt;The tabs in the existing Task Manager have been replaced with a sidebar that allows you to switch between the various sections of the app. Task Manager is a big legacy part of Windows that originally debuted with Windows NT 4.0. It hasn’t had any significant changes for nearly 10 years after it was last overhauled in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKHBhi"&gt;Microsoft is gradually redesigning most of the legacy parts of Windows. A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785617/microsoft-windows-11-media-player-app-audio-video-features"&gt;Media Player app is currently in testing&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 is also getting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822651/microsoft-windows-11-notepad-redesign-find-replace-insider"&gt;redesigned Notepad app with dark mode support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are personally lobbying senators against antitrust legislation: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-APPLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgEeo5Gn3bN60msYwvZmF4lS3gk=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411252/1032853198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wCISDb"&gt;The United States’ biggest tech companies are seriously worried about new antitrust legislation. So much so that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have been personally “calling and meeting with senators,” urging them to oppose the mooted legislation, according to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/punchbowl-news-am-1-18-22/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites “​​multiple Senate aides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZJVRO"&gt;The legislation in question is &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The legislation is currently in its early stages, and is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The bill would need to pass votes from both the House and Senate to become law, but it’s still easy to see why it’s ruffling feathers with Silicon Valley’s biggest beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJSCyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legislation only affects the biggest US tech firms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAJ6oL"&gt;The legislation prohibits online platforms from advantaging their own “products, services, or lines of business” over those of rivals. It applies only to the biggest tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, and Alphabet’s Google (though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/u-s-antitrust-bill-expanded-to-include-tiktok-tencent-s-wechat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it will be expanded to cover Chinese tech giants TikTok and WeChat, too). These platforms would be barred from behavior like biasing search results in their favor, limiting rivals’ access to platform data, and using non-public data from customers to compete against them (activities that companies including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544921/european-commission-google-antitrust-investigation-ad-tech-advertising-services"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are accused of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjJyh"&gt;Although the exact impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, one aspect that worries Apple in particular is a possible threat to its App Store business model. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;letter sent by the company&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said that if the bill became law it would be forced to allow users to “sideload” apps onto iPhones and iPads as it does Macs — meaning installing them from sources outside the App Store. Apple says this threatens the security of its users by allowing unvetted apps onto devices, and cuts into one of its main revenue streams (Apple collects up to 30 percent commission on App Store sales). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EZF9j"&gt;In response to Apple’s arguments, a spokesperson for Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices. All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVoGXM"&gt;Although the Klobuchar-Grassley bill is roundly opposed by tech’s largest companies, smaller players have &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;come out in support of the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of 35 tech firms recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee arguing that the legislation is necessary to curb “the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYvh3v"&gt;“For too long, dominant technology companies have made it difficult for other businesses to compete in the digital marketplace by abusing their gatekeeper status to give themselves and their partners preferential treatment and access on their platforms,” said the letter’s signatories, which include DuckDuckGo, Patreon, Sonos, Wyze, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYg3I5"&gt;It’s not the first time Big Tech’s top executives have personally mobilized against antitrust legislation. Last year, when US politicians were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;considering five new antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to “deliver a warning” against the impact of “rushed” legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony expects Microsoft to ‘continue to ensure’ Activision games stay multiplatform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWf_GnVfVC0jvnD9Lhs1RkS_JmU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411203/sonylogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Knv2ut"&gt;Sony has responded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s blockbuster proposal to buy Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; with a comment on what that might mean for the future games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation consoles. “We expect that Microsoft will abide by contractual agreements and continue to ensure Activision games are multiplatform,” a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-expects-microsoft-to-keep-activision-games-multiplatform-11642665939"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izpw1z"&gt;That statement’s wording is less than definitive. It’s not surprising that Sony would expect Microsoft to honor any existing contractual agreements regarding PlayStation games, as it did when PS5 console exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was released after Microsoft’s acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of publisher Bethesda Softworks. Once existing agreements expire, it opens the door for Microsoft to pursue Xbox exclusivity for the many franchises it’s acquiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpCrQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will Call of Duty be Xbox exclusive?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5OrIO"&gt;The big question is around &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise is hugely popular across both Xbox and PlayStation, but Sony has had a&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; marketing deal in place with Activision for more than five years. “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8787135/call-of-duty-playstation-exclusive-deal-black-ops-3"&gt;PlayStation is the new home of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” declared former PlayStation CEO Andrew House during Sony’s E3 2015 press briefing. &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/11/12/playstation-5-turns-one-today/#sf251182436"&gt;Sony revealed&lt;/a&gt; in November that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;was the second most played PS5 game for the whole of 2021, behind only &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; also secured both of the top spots for US game sales for the whole of 2021, according to NPD, highlighting its impact on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EquwRS"&gt;Once Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal closes, Sony will be powerless over &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s long-term future on PlayStation. Microsoft’s Bethesda acquisition led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; becoming an Xbox and PC exclusive&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is hinting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783314/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-exclusive-pc-phil-spencer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;will also be an Xbox exclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXstjT"&gt;“Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward,” said Spencer earlier this week. It’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft maintains &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; across multiple platforms, but any future &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games go Xbox exclusive. After all, Microsoft isn’t spending $68.7 billion to keep publishing PlayStation games forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s EOS R5C is a 2-in-1 stills and cinema camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih2RQwKG-oLXLm4s2n_Z5DoRnWU=/0x0:1179x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411082/Canon_EOS_R5_C_with_BG_R10_battery_grip.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgcLTn"&gt;Canon has announced a new camera that brings cinema-grade video capabilities to a conventional full-frame mirrorless body. The EOS R5C looks a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn looked a lot like a Canon DSLR, but it’s much bulkier in the back. This is to accommodate an active cooling system so it can shoot for long stretches without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjBjmj"&gt;How long? Well, Canon says the cooling system allows the R5C to shoot up to 8K/60fps indefinitely. This was an issue with the R5; it was advertised as being able to shoot 8K for about 20 minutes, and Canon later released a firmware update to improve overheating problems. The R5C also supports 8K HDR recording in HLG and PQ formats as well as 4K/120fps recording in 4:2:2 10-bit color without cropping the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRL4mdogITyRsxlg04sKVVhYIAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181655/Canon_EOS_R5_C_Stills_Video_Switch.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F6kSdk"&gt;As a stills camera, it’s essentially identical to the R5 except for the lack of in-body image stabilization. The full-frame sensor is 45 megapixels and you can shoot at 12fps with the mechanical shutter or 20fps with the electronic shutter. The camera’s three-way power switch lets you boot it up into photo or video modes, with the menus and button functionalities changing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opDhtI"&gt;The EOS R5C will be released in March for $4,499. That’s $600 more expensive than the EOS R5, but then you’re almost getting another separate camera at the same time. For some creators and producers, the all-in-one convenience could be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku outage leads to frozen TVs and unresponsive devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCO9TkRmPGLT-UjRAOAvWXKew3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410747/DSCF3624_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKOl6u"&gt;Roku experienced a significant service disruption on Wednesday evening, which resulted in some of the company’s streaming devices and even Roku TVs getting stuck on the loading screen or going through a reboot loop and becoming effectively useless. Roku TV sets from TCL, Hisense, and other manufacturers were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2Q4h"&gt;Users took to social media and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/"&gt;Roku’s subreddit&lt;/a&gt; to report problems with their Roku hardware, and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/roku/"&gt;Down Detector showed a spike for Roku’s services&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s support account &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/Service-Interruption-Activation-and-and-service-interruption/m-p/759715#M36686"&gt;acknowledged the ongoing issues at around 8:30PM ET.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X1iJx"&gt;“Roku is aware of an issue reported by users who are unable to access some Roku services,” the company said. “If you are trying to activate your device, please try again later. Our priority is to get this resolved as soon as possible, and we ask that you bear with us as we manage this issue.” By late Wednesday night, the company’s services appeared to be operational again for those who had experienced the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3kmuZ"&gt;In a damning indictment of smart TVs, some customers had trouble using devices connected to the HDMI ports of their Roku TV, such as cable boxes or gaming consoles, during the service outage since the TVs were unable to activate after a factory reset.
