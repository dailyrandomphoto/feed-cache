    <title>Creating visual metaphors: Alex Castro’s illustration tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="photoshop gfx" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VH3RuslGJN1IMagMIAtRwyRriqg=/103x0:918x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547238/photoshop_gfx_06.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLHs8W"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is a place where stories are told, they wouldn’t be nearly as interesting if it weren’t for the artwork that accompanies them. Alex Castro is the illustrator for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and he is the best person to describe how his work complements our reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63kwhE"&gt;What follows are Alex’s thoughts about the tools he prefers to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UsDbfw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BfdH1z"&gt;I’ve heard illustrations described as “visual metaphors” that reflect the meaning of the words. I create artwork for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; articles that communicates the sentiments of a story and catches the reader’s eye. Sometimes, it’s creating batches of simple graphics that could be used for a number of stories. Other times, it’s reading and rereading reports and features trying to dissect what the main takeaways of the stories are and creating visuals specifically for them. Often the hardest part of a project is the initial brainstorming when I’m extracting themes and attempting to translate them into visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LONRLE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10226130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DpL2mA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6TWbuD"&gt;An illustration setup can be as simple as a laptop or as elaborate as an independent art studio, filled with art supplies and tools. It really depends on the style of work. Many digital artists make use of drawing tablets and displays in order to draw directly into their computer software of choice. I do most of my work on the computer, so I tend to not have too much around me. I like to keep a sketchbook and pen handy in order to sketch ideas down quickly or take quick notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XaFaXt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer, tablet, and sketchbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6Lnz"&gt;When we were in the office, I worked on a &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2F27-inch&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Drawing-Graphic-Pressure-Levels-DTK2260K0A/dp/B07TR7YQ8Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4a8f37749a9eeeb7d895e7df24a3452d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;22-inch Wacom Cintiq&lt;/a&gt; drawing tablet. Since I’ve been working from home, I’ve switched to my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-Gaming-PC-Desktop-Aurora/dp/B076BHG74V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ddc96d9a29fa4eaba45c6455f79381cc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alienware Aurora R7&lt;/a&gt; system and purchased a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Monitor-Function-Battery-Free-Pressure/dp/B07FQFQVRJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=78a96d685868fb4be24393ce51b72e0e&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;19.5-inch Huion Kamvas Pro&lt;/a&gt; drawing tablet, which I don’t love as much as the Cintiq, but it’s a great budget option. I also have used a &lt;a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos"&gt;Wacom Intuos&lt;/a&gt; tablet, and sometimes I prefer its workflow over the display tablets since I don’t have to be hunched over the display to draw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Qxmz7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mOtBEa"&gt;Regardless of what computer I’m using, I always have a pen and sketchbook handy. It’s much easier for me to brainstorm when I’m able to scribble all of my ideas freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BBcI5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoshop and added apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpZSWk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fplans.html%3Ffilter%3Dphotography%26plan%3Dindividual&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; is my go-to for all of my artwork, as I’ve been using it since I was nine years old. It serves as the main hub for my work. Then I bring in assets from other software like &lt;a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d"&gt;Cinema 4D&lt;/a&gt;, where I create 3D objects, and Illustrator, where I can design high-res logos and icons. When animating or compositing video, I’ll jump into &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Faftereffects.html&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;After Effects&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to put together layers of video. I also use Photoshop plugins such as &lt;a href="https://topazlabs.com/studio/"&gt;Topaz Studio&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://nikcollection.dxo.com/"&gt;Nik Collection&lt;/a&gt; to apply effects like AI-generated paint strokes, lens distortion, and double exposure. I usually paint these effects in using a layer mask in order to use them more as finishing touches rather than large overall effects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmHbOAXIAo6grXwegaVeXvFSYNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168760/instagram_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sometimes Alex will create the foundation of an image in Cinema 4D, then layer on top of it in Photoshop. A good example is this &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; illustration for a feature on a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lost &lt;/em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rDpJRHH9mZtEefVt9sWRyYKocc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168761/instagram_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other times, Alex will create images in Photoshop then build 3D assets around it, trying to match depth and perspective. This is what he did for this single cover for rapper KB, using a photo of him performing on tour as a base. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WUFUA7"&gt;When working on user interface designs, I usually use &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, a web-based design software specifically made for interactive design. I really love its vector editing features, sometimes preferring it to Illustrator. For projects that could use some 3D work, I’ll occasionally use &lt;a href="https://www.blender.org/"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; instead of Cinema 4D. I personally prefer it to Cinema 4D, but since our team here doesn’t use it, I have to be proficient in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nbxSNG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232774"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IX1UMe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For beginners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="colf48"&gt;If you’re just starting out, I think the cheaper Wacom tablets are a great start for any beginner digital artist. As far as software tools are concerned, I think Photoshop is a must-learn. &lt;a href="https://www.gimp.org/"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://krita.org/en/"&gt;Krita&lt;/a&gt; are said to be great free alternatives, but I admit I’m not very familiar with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon launches group video and audio calling for Echo devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMIB0UguqCfmiemsRhcmdoVqiBM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547236/groupcallingalexa.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group calling on an Echo Show.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgcjpM"&gt;Amazon is launching a new group video or audio calling feature for Echo devices today, just in time for the holidays. Originally announced back in September, group calling will allow up to seven participants to join an audio or video call on supported Echo devices like the Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrqMms"&gt;Echo owners will be able to create and name groups using the Alexa app, and Amazon is also planning to support group calling through its Alexa app soon. You’ll be able to add adult contacts into groups, and friends and family will have to opt in to be part of group calling. This new feature also supports Alexa commands like “Alexa, call my family” to connect to a group you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cF62o1"&gt;Echo group calling could be a good alternative to Zoom and other video calling services. There are no limits on call times, allowing Echo owners to make or receive voice and video calls freely. Without the Alexa app supporting group calling, it’s limited to requiring hardware for now, though. Zoom has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176502/zoom-lifting-40-minute-meeting-limit-holidays-free-hanukkah-christmas-eve-new-years-kwanzaa"&gt;started lifting its 40-minute meeting limit&lt;/a&gt; for several upcoming holidays, and rivals like Microsoft Teams have also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579076/microsoft-teams-free-video-calling-web-zoom-competition"&gt;all-day video calling free&lt;/a&gt; without limits via the web. Google also offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;unlimited Meet calls&lt;/a&gt; until March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps9ER3"&gt;Amazon is launching its group calling feature today in Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the US, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The weirdest pop culture of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZOCgNw5L8DscmfyBYPs-mLUWtoM=/81x0:983x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547131/Baby_Yoda_eggs_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm, Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WwPbC"&gt;2020 has been a strange year, by nearly any metric you choose to use. And that weirdness has bled over to pop culture, as the seemingly endless news cycles of disasters, the ongoing global pandemic, the turmoil of the US elections, the rise of TikTok, the dearth of traditional releases of big movies, and just so many memes resulted in a year of cultural moments that awed, amazed, and just straight-up confused us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OaSPd"&gt;It was a year that seemed almost determined to constantly one-up itself on nonsensical events, each headline more impossible than the last. And faced with all that frightening reality, is it any wonder that the weirdness of 2020’s culture became almost a mirror reflection of the year itself? When the world gets strange, sometimes the only answer is to seek out things that are even stranger — if only to reassure ourselves that we’re not quite at rock bottom just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifNXrd"&gt;Here are some of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rEfSV0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqg48h_uKYM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hV6f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Action Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — This is a documentary about a penny-stock-mogul-funded New Jersey theme park called Action Park which was — due to a combination of a laissez-faire regulatory enforcement and a teen workforce — particularly bizarre and at times, deadly. To get to the go-karts, for instance, you had to go through the beer tent. (One of the highlights of the documentary is discovering Action Park was too weird for Donald Trump to invest in.) The rides were designed by amateurs and tested by the park’s workforce. Stories of lost teeth, bloodied knees, and other battle scars abound. Eventually, the park had to buy its own ambulances. The ride-by-ride story of the park, as told by people who went there, starts as a lark, but as the movie progresses, the viewer begins to realize they are in fact watching a horror film. The documentary itself isn’t that weird — it’s brilliantly done — but the subject matter is so strange it can only possibly have existed in America. Specifically, in the part of America that is New Jersey. — &lt;em&gt;Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

It started when just one lone TikToker, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt;, posted a video singing an ode to the cooking rat. It quickly exploded after another TikTok user, Daniel Mertzlufft, remixed that song into a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6885475193410620678"&gt;full Broadway number&lt;/a&gt;, and it now has dozens of videos across the internet with additional musical numbers, set designs, playbill programs, elaborately choreographed dance numbers, stage directions, giant rat costumes, and more. The whole thing has even broken free of TikTok into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;one-night-only benefit concert&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bizarre, wonderful culmination of how the internet can come together to make something beautiful — even if it’s just a made-up musical. — &lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0cGIj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I hope this email finds you well in these strange times.” &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s reassuring that even when normal life all but disappears, you can still count on a daily deluge of emails in your inbox. But how do you start a message when the person on the other end of it could be experiencing anything from feeling a little cooped up from working from home for too long to being in any number of far worse professional or personal situations. The solution, of course, is the ever-reliable “I hope this email finds you well in these X times” opener. Just replace X depending on your mood, whether it’s “unprecedented,” “difficult,” or just plain “strange.” — &lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tI7Z8f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“I hope this email finds you well”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How the email found me: &lt;a href="https://t.co/JAca0f6Ag7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JAca0f6Ag7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Zohar (@TomZohar) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomZohar/status/1299892711781101568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neuxtb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Total Landscaping &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It started as a series of incredulous tweets from political reporters in Pennsylvania covering President Trump’s legal efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election — “Is Donald Trump convening the world’s press at a small landscaping company on the outskirts of Philadelphia?” — and it ended as one of the strangest, uncomfortable, and most meme-worthy turns in an already unorthodox election season. The Trump team’s unexplained decision to hold an off-the-rails press conference declaring election fraud at a nondescript landscaping company located on a highway in between a sex shop and a crematorium has since spawned Zoom backgrounds, a VR hangout for furries, and, naturally, a whole bunch of merch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GRT7aP"&gt;Whether or not Trump thought he was actually booking the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia hardly seems to matter anymore. And since Rudy Giuliani and others graced it with their smarmy presence, the landscaping company has become a tourist attraction, a curiosity in a year already replete with strange goings-on. To their credit, Four Seasons Total Landscaping is doing their best to ride it out, leveraging their newfound infamy for good by selling official merch and retweeting the best quotes to show they’re in on the joke. The conspiracy theorists, though, are doing their best to slander the company as DNC money launderers, or worse, vote stealers. (Seriously.) Let’s hope the company can ignore the threats and get back to blowing leaves in the near future. — &lt;em&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OyzXz7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7aSybHRa6s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bd8gFY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;Maybe it’s my nostalgia for being able to freely walk around New York City, but HBO’s &lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson &lt;/em&gt;is the closest thing that comes to the joys of real-life people-watching. The show is largely footage of strangers around Manhattan, chopped up into short clips —glimpses, really— and strung together by awkward voiceover meditations from Wilson himself. The concept might resemble a bad student film uploaded to Vimeo (actually, his early work &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; on Vimeo), but the vignettes escalate to something unexpected and, at times, profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgPPax"&gt;An episode about improving memory ends up taking Wilson to Idaho, where he attends a conference of narcissistic believers of the Mandela effect. One episode, the fourth, titled “How to Cover Your Furniture,” was about exactly that. Then I looked away for a moment, and when my eyes returned to the screen, there was Wilson, interviewing a man attempting to elongate the foreskin of his penis with a weighted contraption in his pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dip5zf"&gt;A normal stroll through a city isn’t as eventful or cohesive an experience as the one John Wilson delivers in any given episode of &lt;em&gt;How To&lt;/em&gt;. But watching the show will leave you with the comforting feeling that New York is bustling, big, and full of strange people and possibilities. At any point, you might catch Kyle MacLachlan at the subway station, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvNUgOb1RzY"&gt;struggling to swipe his MetroCard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— Kevin Nguyen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gpgthP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby Yoda eating Frog Lady’s babies &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(This entry includes spoilers for the current season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUkTea"&gt;We know space is a cold, empty vacuum where no one can hear you scream, but then &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; brought us the wide-eyed visage of Baby Yoda to make it slightly less awful. So the sight of the beloved green creature — official name Grogu — slurping down the eggs of a desperate Frog Lady hit fans of the show hard. She was trying to take the last of her brood to her home planet to avoid the extinction of her species. The backlash was swift: He’s a murderer! He killed her babies! It’s genocide! One &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-eating-controversy/"&gt;Lucasfilm exec tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the eggs were unfertilized “like the chicken eggs many of us enjoy,” and that Baby Yoda eating them was “intentionally disturbing for comedic effect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5h8pK"&gt;Yes, but, the show introduced the unfertilized eggs as the last hope for the Frog species, the whole purpose of the two-part mission that nearly got Mando and the Razor Crest eaten by frost spiders. They were important and probably shouldn’t have been used as props for “comedic effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7kzXa"&gt;To be perfectly honest, it raised more questions (for me, at least) about the people in charge of watching the eggs than the hungry baby who ate them. Wouldn’t Frog Lady notice there were eggs missing? Shouldn’t there have been some kind of child-proof lock on the egg container? And doesn’t Mando ever feed the poor kid? We find out in subsequent episodes that he does, but he should think about packing some string cheese and crackers for the kid next time. Because for parents of small children on a long road trip, this is the way (to avoid a cranky kid meltdown). — &lt;em&gt;Kim Lyons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0g9d4MBh9Jq-txBfKD_0mvH90Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173026/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_4.51.11_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hZeu2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Felton’s DracoTok obsession is also my obsession &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve pretty much done nothing other than have an endless stream of Netflix running on my TV and TikTok running on my phone. TikTok goes through rapid waves of trends. Something is hot for a minute and then it disappears, as is life on the internet. One thing that stuck around, however, and I can’t peel my eyes away from is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dracotok?lang=en"&gt;DracoTok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU4GXm"&gt;DracoTok is this beautiful wholesome world that my 12-year-old, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter-&lt;/em&gt;fanfiction-writing self would likely cry over. Tom Felton, who played Slytherin prince Draco Malfoy in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;films, joined TikTok at the height of 20- and 30-somethings rekindling their obsession with the series through cringe-inducing posts about being in love with Draco Malfoy. Most actors would ignore these types of sentiments that people post without really understanding the concept of going viral (no one ever thinks they’re going to go viral, and I imagine most people instantly regret it the second it happens), but Felton has jumped in and embraced it! He’s kick-started contests looking for the best version of Malfoy’s “Potter!” bark. He duets with TikTok creators roleplaying their love for Draco. From thousands of miles away, he cheers on people’s deepest obsession with his &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;character — and it’s positively charming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nnEbH"&gt;Everything about it is so inherently dumb, but it’s the heartwarming, fluffy, absurdly adorable type of dumb that I really needed this year. If you were a &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;kid or are a fan today, I highly recommend tuning into Felton’s ongoing saga of trying to hype up his fans while also being a dork himself. Guaranteed smile. — &lt;em&gt;Julia Alexander &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sarah Cooper reflects on her whirlwind 2020 of Trump impressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1Wn9iJ6-_mwvhpS5IIQPrEsFfM=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547087/SCEF_Unit_06181R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens when a product designer becomes a creator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLg2i3"&gt;If you were on social media — &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;social media — in 2020, you probably saw a video of Sarah Cooper lip-syncing to President Donald Trump’s public appearances. And while her early videos were &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme?lang=en"&gt;made using TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, they migrated to Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. As the year ends, Cooper has a Netflix special called &lt;em&gt;Everything’s Fine&lt;/em&gt; under her belt and is developing TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKiUYG"&gt;Before all that, though, there was TikTok, perhaps best thought of as a video editing tool with a distribution network conveniently attached. Cooper tried it out, with stupendous results. Though she’d previously written two books, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/100-Tricks-Appear-Smart-Meetings/dp/1449476058?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GF3C6Y8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;it was her madcap take on Trump — the president as bad boss — that launched her into celebrity status. Cooper brought the observational style she honed working at companies like Google and Flickr to her study of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8y4bA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DzSVDm"&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them,” Cooper says. ”And that’s kind of true for companies. You see how the CEO acts. You see how leadership acts, and everybody imitates that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSYfNg"&gt;Unlike many other product designers, Cooper now finds herself on the other end of products — as a creator. It’s hard to monetize on TikTok and virtually impossible on Twitter, where Cooper feels her community is. Of all the platforms, YouTube was the one that gave her a financial windfall when she posted her videos. “It was really more like an afterthought, but in terms of monetization, it’s the only place really to make money with videos,” Cooper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzwDLa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme/video/6819061413877763334" data-video-id="6819061413877763334" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@whatchugotforme" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme"&gt;@whatchugotforme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6819046896666004229"&gt;♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wlv8xz"&gt;Moving to Netflix was similarly surreal — Cooper remembers when Netflix was just a DVD-by-mail startup. Now, of course, the company produces original content, including her own, which was produced by Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph and full of celebrity cameos. “I completely clammed up with Jon Hamm because I’ve watched every season of &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, like twice,” Cooper says. Also, she regrets not asking Winona Ryder what filming &lt;em&gt;Edward Scissorhands&lt;/em&gt; was like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUI9Nj"&gt;But, of course, the production was shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, with on-set tests, a virus scare, and Zoom meetings. “Everything was on Zoom, which is sad because I think Google Hangouts is a pretty good tool,” Cooper says. “I was on Hangouts at Google all the time.” We asked her to reflect on her whirlwind year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOcnTj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ2enk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had a big 2020. How are you thinking about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMh5UM"&gt;It’s been the biggest year of my career. I’m actually working on things, for the first time in my life, that I’m so excited to be working on. I’m doing right now, what I’ve always, always wanted to do. And so it’s just weird to feel that way about this year, but then also feel like, fuck 2020. Can’t wait until it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p3njEj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Work is just this fascinating place.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgDGAG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work seems like your most important subject. From &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, there’s a through-line to Trump. How did your interest in workplace dynamics play a role in what you’ve created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m71T7F"&gt;I fought it for a long time because I thought it wasn’t cool to talk about work. But work is just this fascinating place. At first, when I started making the Trump videos, I didn’t really know how they fit in with everything else I was doing. Then looking back, it was like, “Oh yeah, everything he does is this performance that he’s putting on&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;That’s the through-line of everything that I do. We’re all sort of putting on a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc86JK"&gt;I had this idea when I was like 21 that I was going to make a blog called My Life on Stage, because I always felt like I was performing, wherever I went. Work is just, it’s like a prime place for that kind of thing. Especially in tech, because you’re there because you’re being paid, because it’s a job. But in tech, you’re also supposed to be very passionate and excited about everything, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk9rwZ"&gt;That was kind of what led to me leaving Google really. I felt like I was living this double life. I was so much more passionate about writing than I was about what I was doing at work. And yet I had to be a manager, which means being a cheerleader, which means talking about how this is the greatest thing we’re doing... The project we’re working on right now is so important and it’s going to change the world and all of these things. And I just didn’t feel that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AItAMx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really curious about how your background as a designer informed your approach to social media platforms. How did you think about trying to build an audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZRzo1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2qa6D"&gt;Well, I’ve been trying to build an audience for a very long time. It’s just been a process of like, building an audience and kind of getting bored with something and then rebuilding and rebuilding and rebuilding. I was always just trying new platforms, new video platforms, new ways to share ideas online. I just tried everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5192g"&gt;I had my own blog for a while, thecooperreview.com. One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch, even when the blog went viral. A lot of these social platforms just have built-in ways of sharing and built-in ways of creating audiences. So I realized it was a lot easier to try to build an audience through Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIX4RI"&gt;That’s kind of why I tried TikTok. Everybody was doing it and I had nothing better to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQBeEy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You moved away from using the TikTok editing tool. When did that happen and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGn56N"&gt;TikTok’s [editing tool is] very chronological. I have different characters in my videos and it’s not like I could shoot all of one character, all of the other character, and then edit them together. It was really like me sequentially, like, now I’m Trump, now I’m the person responding to Trump, now I’m Trump again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnBc0z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8WWdYldVg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9whupN"&gt;But when I wanted to do anything that was longer than 60 seconds, it was just more complicated. I think the first one I did, on my own, without TikTok, was Don Jr. interviewing his dad for Father’s Day. Then I did “person, woman, two man camera” and that was just a longer video, almost two minutes. You can’t make anything over 60 seconds on TikTok, so I just had my own little hacky way of lip-syncing and recording myself and then editing it in Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdXaHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you think about moving your audience from social networks to Netflix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzT8GW"&gt;A long time ago, I wanted to make a video making fun of how Gary Vaynerchuk is on YouTube telling people to follow him on Twitter. And he’s on Twitter telling people to follow his Facebook. And then he’s on Facebook telling people to follow... So, he’s just like trying to get people to follow him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1voL3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2qIgE"&gt;I just don’t think that works. I feel like you need to meet people where they are and if people are on YouTube, bring your stuff to YouTube, and let them view it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIVqRj"&gt;With Netflix, it was just funny because I’d be on a call with Netflix marketing, and they’d be telling me about personalization and how their platform works and stuff like that. When I worked in tech, I used to design personalization features. It’s really interesting, being on these different sides of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUI9sM"&gt;I’d worked at Flickr and I left Flickr to do acting. I was doing a little bit of modeling and I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed. It’s kind of cool, seeing the other side of it, coming from a perspective of like, first I was designing these experiences, and now I’m creating content for these experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08WMrf"&gt;It gives me a better understanding of how things work. Like, how to caption things so that people will be intrigued by them — so that you don’t give it away, but you pique their interest. And all of these things, I feel like I’ve honed over the decades I’ve wasted in social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waw1yE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the most extreme example of dogfooding I think I’ve ever heard of. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyEd4n"&gt;Cut to doing the Netflix special, where I was doing the &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; bus scene with Dame Helen Mirren and trying to teach her how to TikTok. I would kill to be Dame Helen Mirren! And she’s like, “How do I lip sync? And I’m like, “Why am I teaching you how to lip-sync? You should not be lip-syncing. You’re Shakespearean-trained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ivZiXV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRu-QUeqoMs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8sluJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netflix special would have been a time crunch in any year. But we also have a pandemic. How did that affect filming? How did that affect the collaboration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADt1V7"&gt;Not only was it my first special; it was my first COVID production. It was a lot of people’s first COVID production. There were a lot of masks. There was a COVID specialist on set. There was a lot of like, “Hey, you guys are too close.” Or, “Do you need some hand sanitizer?” Constant COVID tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frRRGw"&gt;The last day, I walked onto set, and they took my temperature. I had a temperature, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m trying so hard not to get sick,” because I didn’t want to shut down this whole production. And now on the last day, I have a temperature! But it turned out I was just standing in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c57b9o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you focusing on television, or will we still see you on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="voprvC"&gt;I’ll always be on Twitter. I can never get away, for some reason. For the foreseeable future, I’m going to be focused on TV. But I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get away from social media. Plus, I think it’s HBO Max, is now going to be releasing all their films, simultaneously, online as well as in theaters. And so, all these big movie stars are all internet stars now. We’re just all on the internet now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouI13Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boba Fett show heading to Disney Plus in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EYOEzcQZhYtmDDziYOyiuelGlqY=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547049/HUC2_FF_003990_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8uu4li"&gt;After years of speculation about whether Boba Fett would get his own spinoff of some kind, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 finale confirmed that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542557/the-mandalorian-season-2-premiere-review-disney-plus"&gt;Boba Fett series&lt;/a&gt; will hit Disney Plus in December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZNuMg"&gt;The show, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, was not included as an announcement during Disney’s big investor day last week. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; projects&lt;/a&gt;, including two &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;spinoffs — an Ahsoka Tano show and &lt;em&gt;Rangers of the New Republic &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a Lando Calrissian show, and a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;anime, were announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joYKx4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: The following contains light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s second season finale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhCn1x"&gt;The announcement comes during a post-credits scene (ah, yes, the post-credits scenes), which finds Boba Fett and Fennec Shand in Jabba the Hutt’s palace. Fans will recall this is where Boba Fett was thrown into the sarlacc pit a few years before. Now, Boba Fett is back — and after blasting away Bib Fortuna, the pasty-faced employee of Jabba the Hutt who gave me nightmares as a child — Boba Fett takes his place on Jabba’s throne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY900i"&gt;Wild! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVD4mi"&gt;We’re operating under the assumption that this is a spinoff series, but it &lt;em&gt;could theoretically &lt;/em&gt;be the name of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s third season. The “Mandalorian” could refer to any of the armored warriors, like Boba Fett or even Bo-Katan. Still, the scene announcing the assumed spinoff series will come as a nice surprise for anyone who held out hope for a Boba Fett movie years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13926062/star-wars-rogue-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17355964/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-ron-howard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were being released. Now, there’s a TV show instead. It’s a smart move for Disney and Lucasfilm. A series is less of a risk than a movie, and it helps keep customers subscribed to the platform. Plus, tying everything together is a pretty good way to get people to stay on Disney Plus to watch other shows when they’re done with the most recent &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode; it’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21761493/mandalorian-star-wars-clone-rebels-dave-filoni-ahsoka-tano-thrawn"&gt;happening with &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftZeup"&gt;While this season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is over, it’s clear that fans have a ton of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to look forward to in 2021. Can there be too much &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;? Former CEO Bob Iger certainly thought &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fatigue &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-star-wars-solo-flop-1202175861/"&gt;took over at the box office&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe Disney Plus is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft president sounds alarm on ‘ongoing’ SolarWinds hack, identifies 40 more precise targets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vL8jO8jazxh3fs78mZokAREuV3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545709/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rg6lXB"&gt;Microsoft president Brad Smith &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/"&gt;warned that the wide-ranging hack&lt;/a&gt; of the SolarWinds’ Orion IT software is “ongoing,” and that investigations reveal “an attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact.” The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;breach targeted&lt;/a&gt; several US government agencies and is believed to have been carried out by Russian nation-state hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOZGRX"&gt;Smith characterized the hack as “a moment of reckoning” and laid out in no uncertain terms just how large and how dangerous Microsoft believes the hack to be. It “represents an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world,” Smith argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLt89f"&gt;He believes that it “is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency.” Though the post stops short of explicitly accusing Russia, the implication is very clear. “The weeks ahead will provide mounting and we believe indisputable evidence about the source of these recent attacks,” according to Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07z580"&gt;To illustrate just how far-reaching the hack was, Smith included a map that used telemetry taken from Microsoft’s Defender Anti-Virus software to show people who had installed versions of the Orion software that contained malware from the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAx_-uEt75RSC1ao7lwi-BiBq3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181335/cyber1_960x540.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A map showing customers affected by the malware in SolarWinds’ Orion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N4ROso"&gt;Microsoft has also been working this week to notify “more than 40 customers that the attackers targeted more precisely and compromised through additional and sophisticated measures,” according to Smith. Approximately 80 percent of those customers are located in the US, but Microsoft also identified victims in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Israel, and the UAE. “It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aPw6G"&gt;Investigations into the hack are ongoing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement &lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2175-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-and-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; to say that they were coordinating a “whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident.” And Smith warned that “we should all be prepared for stories about additional victims in the public sector and other enterprises and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reM7qu"&gt;Earlier on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-breach/suspected-russian-hacking-spree-used-another-major-tech-supplier-sources-idUSKBN28R2ZJ?il=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft had been hacked as part of the breach and that “it also had its own products leveraged to further the attacks on others.” But Microsoft denied that claim in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Sl1Ap"&gt;Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious Solar Winds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed. We have not found evidence of access to production services or customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications that our systems were used to attack others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gvdKJw"&gt;Microsoft has been responding to the hack &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/"&gt;since December 13th&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2Fensuring-customers-are-protected-from-solorigate%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blocking versions of SolarWinds Orion&lt;/a&gt; that contained the malware. Microsoft and a coalition of tech companies also seized control a domain that played a key role in the SolarWinds breach, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-industry-partners-seize-key-domain-used-in-solarwinds-hack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2jWXS"&gt;SolarWinds has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;taken the step&lt;/a&gt; of hiding a list of high-profile clients from its website, perhaps to protect them from negative publicity. The list included more than 425 of the companies on the Fortune 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgoSHr"&gt;As for Microsoft, Smith used his post to call for a more organized, communal response against cyberattacks, both at a government level and amongst private institutions. “We need a more effective national and global strategy to protect against cyberattacks,” he writes. Microsoft is also looking for “stronger steps to hold nation-states accountable for cyberattacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is pulling Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store and offering full refunds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePtprMvGPMEkK9hkDQVsQEf2lZs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545499/pu15d4e891d784977cacbfcbb00c48f133_1603729915_6192392_screenshot_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Iv2O1"&gt;Sony is pulling &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from the PlayStation Store and offering full refunds for anyone who bought the game from the digital storefront, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336"&gt;the company said on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to start the refund process now, Sony says to &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/cyberpunk-2077-refunds/"&gt;visit this site&lt;/a&gt; and sign into your PlayStation account to submit a request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2YMi7"&gt;However, later on Thursday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339762162609209346"&gt;Sony said&lt;/a&gt; it is “aware some users are experiencing issues” accessing the refund form. If you’re seeing issues, you may want to try again later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcM2qE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has already been removed from the PlayStation Store for a few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers on their PS5s, and the game doesn’t come up in a search for “&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;” on the web version of the store. Following older, online listing links to the game will show its store page, but with the option to wish list it only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wXXfU4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund. Please visit the following link to initiate the refund: &lt;a href="https://t.co/DEZlC0LmUG"&gt;https://t.co/DEZlC0LmUG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Twi8At"&gt;Players have found that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, which has only been out for a little more than one week, has been riddled with bugs. And while game looks and performs well in backwards compatibility mode on the PS5, it is prone to routine crashes and a number of distracting visual glitches. On PS4, however, the game fares a lot worse — &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; poor performance, low framerate, and texture pop-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bP58eS"&gt;Sony’s move comes just days after &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red said people unsatisfied with their purchase on the PS4 or Xbox One should request a refund. Yet due to Sony’s stringent refund policy, many who bought digital versions of the game from the PlayStation Store were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178872/cyberpunk-2077-refund-sony-ps4-ps5-playstation-issue"&gt;unable to get refunds&lt;/a&gt;. (Players who bought the Xbox One version of the game have reported better luck with Microsoft’s more generous refund policy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebRFiJ"&gt;CD Projekt Red posted a note &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/inwestorzy/raporty-gieldowe/raport-biezacy-nr-66-2020/"&gt;to its investor website&lt;/a&gt; disclosing Sony’s decision, saying (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2020/12/rb_66-2020-czasowe-wstrzymanie-dostepnosci-gry-cyberpunk-2077-w-playstation-store.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="D6oxP0"&gt;The decision [to disclose Sony’s decision] was undertaken following our discussion with SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] regarding a full refund for all gamers who had purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund at this time. All copies of the game previously purchased digitally on PlayStation Store remain available for use by their respective buyers. Gamers can still buy physical versions of the game in retail and mail order stores. All copies, whether digital or physical, will continue to receive support and updates from the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vaalcH"&gt;It’s unclear when Sony plans to return &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to the PlayStation Store; the company’s note says the game will be unavailable in its digital format “until further notice.” It’s also not clear if Microsoft plans to similarly yank the game from its digital storefront or offer full refunds. Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q09E74"&gt;All digital and physical copies of the game will continue to receive support and updates, and PlayStation owners can still buy physical copies of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. “We are working hard to bring &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; back to the PlayStation Store as soon as possible,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1339846154176126976"&gt;says CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHEGk2"&gt;CD Projekt Red has also committed to releasing patches to improve &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. The company has already released one post-launch update, and in a December 13th statement, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;the studio said&lt;/a&gt; another update is “coming within the next 7 days.” More significant patches are planned for January and February. “Together these should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGxES0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 18th, 4:50AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added more detail on store removal, and investor note from CD Projekt Red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baby Yoda can live on your desk thanks to AR and Google Search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRuxApynhIjazjHMc5VEatlHNic=/862x0:3277x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545371/HUC2_FF_001688.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grogu’s face upon realizing he lives with me.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RMzqiL"&gt;Google has added Grogu (formerly Baby Yoda) to its &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/16/google-3d-animal-grogu/"&gt;augmented reality search results&lt;/a&gt;, so some quick typing can drop an AR version of the little guy straight into your bedroom or home office, no spaceship required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTJJDf"&gt;Searching “Grogu”, “The Child”, “The Mandalorian”, or “Baby Yoda” on mobile or in the Google app will return the usual Knowledge Panel with a Wikipedia summary of the character. But now you can click “View in 3D” to check out a model, and if you’re really feeling like noted &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/werner-herzog-baby-yoda"&gt;Baby Yoda fan Werner Herzog&lt;/a&gt;, “View in your space” to get up close and personal in AR. Interactions are limited to zooming in and out, but he’s a really cute alien. Maybe that’s enough for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqwFbZoqijbZDTW2lR5z7M-DVt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180855/EB24D9A8_1B24_4966_A52E_56B274FC784A.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conveniently, Grogu is only slightly bigger than my water bottle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m4PDqW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171601/google-adds-augmented-reality-ar-animals-search-3d"&gt;Google last added 50 new animals&lt;/a&gt; to its AR search results, including hippos, zebras, and giraffes. The company has grown its digital menagerie over time, but Grogu is by far the most exotic and far flung inclusion since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. Grogu isn’t the first time Google has feature &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; content prominently in its products. The company partnered with Disney for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21595320/google-disney-mandalorian-ar-lucasfilm-android-arcore-baby-yoda"&gt;The Mandalorian AR Experience&lt;/a&gt; app built to use Google’s ARCore, and before that, offered exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762638/pixel-augmented-reality-stickers-google-launch"&gt;AR stickers on the Pixel 2&lt;/a&gt; in its now-discontinued Playground feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjTdSH"&gt;You can can catch up with Grogu’s TV exploits with our handy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;Guide to &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you’re like me, you can calmly wait for Google to add voice recognition so AR Grogu can react every time you say his name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hot Wheels is giving the real Tesla experience by delaying their model Cybertruck </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cq9ON8"&gt;If you’ve been waiting anxiously for your radio-controlled Cybertruck, you’re going to have to wait a little longer: Mattel has had to delay it until May 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/cybertruck-toy-release-delayed-five-months-but-don-t-blame-tesla?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1Jge1"&gt;The RC cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147004/hot-wheels-tesla-cybertruck-rc-car-remote-controlled-toy"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;, were supposed to ship this month, but have been delayed because of “unforseen production issues.” Mattel appears to be experiencing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17234296/tesla-model-3-robots-production-hell-elon-musk"&gt;manufacturing hell,&lt;/a&gt;” though the company did not release details on the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QUnGh2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just another way that the model imitates reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZjZHO"&gt;These toys are scaled-down versions of the real Cybertruck, and come in two models: an 1:64 scale model, which costs $20, and an 1:10 scale model that costs $400. Both models went out of stock after pre-orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUlDI5"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck, unveiled in November 2019, is a futuristic, electric spin on a pickup truck. The angular, stainless steel truck has armored glass windows, though, embarrassingly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation"&gt;they shattered during a public test&lt;/a&gt;. Still, CEO Elon Musk has said it’s the “truck you want in the apocalypse.” The $69,900 tri-motor Cybertruck is expected to hit the road in late 2021, with the $39,900 rear-wheel drive version coming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzGTxG"&gt;The $400 toy version of the truck is supposed to be hobbyist grade and off-roadable. And while it may not have the armored glass windows of the real thing, it does come with a sticker that makes its window look shattered, just like in the demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXoWCL"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom"&gt;any hardcore Tesla fans&lt;/a&gt; who reserved the car may be disappointed, this is just another way that the model imitates reality. Tesla is infamous for its delays. The Model X shipped &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2015/09/03/elon-musk-confirms-september-29-delivery-first-model-x/"&gt;a year after was promised&lt;/a&gt;, the cheapest Model 3 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282810/tesla-model-3-standard-range-35000-delays"&gt;went past its delivery timeframe&lt;/a&gt;, and the Roadster’s release was supposed to be this year — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/05/07/tesla-roadster-delay-2022-elon-musk/"&gt;but wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cj0149"&gt;So in a sense, Hot Wheels is just trying to give you the experience of buying one of Tesla’s actual cars, just at a 1:100 scale cost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo Immortal plays like, well, Diablo on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E693NuxzSTxKyV68KfCZFo_gV0k=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544832/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_DemonHunter_Female_CharacterSelectCinematic.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a9cddE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; didn’t make a great first impression. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018"&gt;announced at Blizzcon in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when most fans were expecting the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; title, not a free-to-play spinoff for smartphones. Since then, Blizzard has been very quiet about &lt;em&gt;Immortal &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;though &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; was eventually announced&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCvR7y"&gt;That’s starting to change. Ahead of a technical alpha that’s set to kick off soon, I was able to play through the early stages of the game. And while I can’t speak to every aspect, one thing was immediately clear: this feels like a proper &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uULlQr"&gt;A mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; makes a lot of sense. There are already countless clones and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;-inspired titles on smartphones, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055352/diablo-3-dark-souls-nintendo-switch-blizzard-from-software"&gt;the Nintendo Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;proved just how fun the series is to play on the go. There’s just something about the hack and slash gameplay that makes it a great fit for a handheld experience. It’s the kind of game that can suck you in for hours and yet, paradoxically, is also something that doesn’t always require your full attention. I spent part of my time previewing &lt;em&gt;Immortal &lt;/em&gt;while I was also in a Zoom meeting. (Don’t tell Nilay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQmBnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; takes place between the events of the last two &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; games, and it’s surprisingly story-heavy for a mobile title. There are brief cutscenes and lots of voice acting, though the actual narrative is typical &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; fare: you’re dropped into a small village overrun with the undead and cultists, while Deckard Cain tells you to collect magical shards that can stop some world-ending calamity — you know, regular &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fDaUV7ykamLAIyZSmuzX-R8YZVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179513/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_Barbarian_OnMadKingsBreach_SkeletonKingBossFight.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gxLMa3"&gt;More important is how the game plays. &lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; features entirely touch-based controls (there’s no gamepad support right now) and they work surprisingly well. The left side of the screen is a virtual joystick so you can move around, while the right features all of your powers. It works just like a regular &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; title for the most part. You have a main attack and will quickly unlock special abilities, each with their own cooldowns. You just tap on the abilities to use them, and some require you to actually aim. The only big addition is a new class-specific “ultimate” ability, which is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;; it’s an incredibly powerful attack, but one that builds up slowly, forcing you to use it sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1HCJG"&gt;The early-game dungeons I played through were all relatively small, which made them great for mobile, as I could squeeze them in when I just had 20 minutes or so to play. They were also relatively straightforward: I didn’t find myself doing much exploration in search of loot or other secrets. That said, I really enjoyed the boss fights and raids, which do a good job of increasing the scale with massive monsters and big waves of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaeNov"&gt;Really, the fact that the game feels so familiar is arguably the best-case scenario. Blizzard seems to have done an admirable job of transporting the spirit of its loot-heavy roleplaying game to a smartphone. But there are also a few elements of the experience — ones that will likely be key to its longevity — that I couldn’t test out in this preview. For one thing, &lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; is billed as a massively multiplayer game, one where tens of thousands of players exist simultaneously on one server. I saw a few players running around dungeons and graveyards while I played, but I couldn’t test out any of the actual social features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qUL2poVYgGmWfr2Y8N9-MyUdCUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179551/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_PaperDoll_Monk.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFpRSq"&gt;Perhaps the biggest question mark, though, is how Blizzard will monetize the game. The developer says all character classes and story content will be entirely free, and that gear isn’t something you can buy. Instead, you have to collect it out in the world by defeating monsters or completing quests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQFn2"&gt;But there’s still plenty to buy, including stones that let you reforge an item, “crests” that add better rewards when you complete a randomized dungeon, and a battle pass that Blizzard says will refresh monthly. There’s even a player-to-player marketplace — though the developer is quick to say it’s nothing like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4742120/blizzard-shutting-down-diablo-iii-auction-houses"&gt;the infamous auction house from&lt;em&gt; Diablo III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZZhov"&gt;Here’s how Blizzard explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z1qsZC"&gt;Before we get into the details let’s be clear — this is not the &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; real-money auction house. Player exchange has been a part of &lt;em&gt;Diablo’&lt;/em&gt;s history, and we’ve learned many lessons–both good and bad–along the way. In &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; we want players to have the ability to participate in a fair, healthy, player-driven economy that doesn’t circumvent gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dxP2R"&gt;The market connects anonymous buyers and sellers, with no ability to cash-out. There are limits to what can and cannot be put on the market. While it will be a possible source of certain materials, supplementary items, and legendary gems, it is not a place to acquire gear. It’s also a way for players who wish to remain free-to-play to exchange items they find for additional in-game currency, beyond what they’re able to earn through play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rLw58F"&gt;Those are some important question marks, though it’s likely it’ll still be a while before we have a complete picture of what &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; is. Blizzard is opening the game up to a small amount of Android users in Australia as part of this alpha, but there’s no word on when it will be available more broadly, as the game still doesn’t have a release date.&lt;/p&gt;
