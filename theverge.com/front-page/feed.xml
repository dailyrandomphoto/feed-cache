    <title>Sen. Warren calls for ‘meticulous’ review of Amazon’s MGM acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Votes On Whether To Advance For The People Act" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JncTv_4zwCDFJMMAkppOOc7QXGE=/0x0:7280x4853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521454/1233598960.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks with reporters on her way to a lunch with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol on June 22, 2021 in Washington, DC.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CMfawC"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren is calling on the Federal Trade Commission for a thorough review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;Amazon’s bid to acquire MGM&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the deal could harm consumers and may have anticompetitive effects in the streaming space and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ilu4t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689724/Letter_to_FTC_re_Amazon_MGM_Deal.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to newly sworn-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;FTC chair Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Warren urged the FTC to specifically and closely examine “the possible anticompetitive effects this deal will have on streaming services and entertainment products in addition to the broader impacts that this transaction may have on workers, small businesses, and competition overall as Amazon—which already dominates numerous markets—accelerates its aggressive monopolistic behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2qoUE"&gt;The FTC is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;reviewing the deal&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger antitrust investigation of Amazon’s business. In her letter to Khan, Warren cited Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act as barring mergers for which the outcome “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.” Warren argued that because Amazon’s economic impact is so far-reaching — including but not limited to its services business — a deal that benefits its streaming service Prime Video will only strengthen its position in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VEA380"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Warren argues the deal could hurt consumers and competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70gjaM"&gt;Amazon has a limited footprint in the film industry, but it will have a number of advantages as it enters the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyAco"&gt;The company’s deep pockets put the company in a virtually unmatched position to invest heavily to strengthen its position in the streaming wars. Moreover, Prime Video is offered as one of many services that are technically “perks” rather than individual paid subscriptions. New offerings like exclusive content serve to boost the appeal of Amazon’s paid Prime subscription service, which costs $119 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="him8Uj"&gt;Amazon announced in May that it had reached a deal to acquire the legacy film studio for $8.45 billion. At the time, SVP of Prime Video and Amazon Studios Mike Hopkins said that Amazon was drawn to MGM because of “the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a79exp"&gt;In her letter, however, Warren wrote that the company’s “tactic to operate at a financial loss and use low prices to lure in customers and capture the market has worked before, and the FTC must determine whether this vertical acquisition is truly an entertainment strategy or merely another step towards unfettered monopolization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtuRmh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United’s latest jets will offer Bluetooth for in-flight entertainment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdgPYdElk5WDA3pMxTiWWDoMt8k=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521351/Interior_IFE_Rendering.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: United&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EhOGef"&gt;United Airlines is adding a long-awaited feature to the in-flight entertainment seatback screens of its new Boeing 737 Max 8 jets — support for Bluetooth headphones. The company &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/united-adds-270-boeing-and-airbus-aircraft-to-fleet-largest-order-in-airline-s-history-and-biggest-by-a-single-carrier-in-a-decade-2653586391.html"&gt;is making the upgrade as part of “United Next”&lt;/a&gt;, a new plan to expand and modernize its fleet with what it says are larger, fuel-efficient jets and a more comfortable in-flight experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoXsd"&gt;I haven’t flown in the last two years — for reasons that are hopefully obvious — but the thing that grinds most of my past flying experience to a halt is dealing with the bizarre two-pronged audio jacks airplanes use for inflight audio. Having headphones with a 3.5mm audio jack isn’t hard, but it doesn’t reflect the Bluetooth audio lifestyle, Apple, and plenty of other tech companies have slowly forced me to adopt. I don’t like the wireless audio freak I’ve become, but it happened, which makes United’s upgrades so exciting, as demoed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?s=20"&gt;in the tweets below&lt;/a&gt; from aviation writer Jason Rabinowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0muG5Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The main attraction of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt;'s new interior is the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PanasonicAero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PanasonicAero&lt;/a&gt; seatback IFE system. It finally offers one of the overall most requested passenger items: BLUETOOTH AUDIO. Narrowbody aircraft with these screens will finally make it a reality. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaxEx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PaxEx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tD004G4x7c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tD004G4x7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AirlineFlyer/status/1409916190445670405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tD5U5r"&gt;Adding seatback screens made a huge difference in how tolerable flying is, but it’s been held up by lagging audio support that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;has even written a guide&lt;/a&gt; to getting around. And this isn’t a problem unique to United. Other airlines like Delta or JetBlue have been offering seatback screens for years, but have also saddled flyers with analog audio. United just might be one of the first airlines to start the next wave of inflight entertainment improvements (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMAFgy"&gt;However, there’s room for things to go a bit sideways. As part of its upgrades, United’s new 737 Max 8 jets offer 10 or 13-inch inflight entertainment screens on the backs of all seats, which might mean a lot of people trying to connect to Bluetooth at once. That could cause interference, and might also make the process of connecting your headphones more of a chore if you’re having to hunt through multiple devices trying to pair in the same menu. United currently only offers Bluetooth on its Max 8 jets which it says should start flying this summer. The company didn’t share how it plans to address issues with Bluetooth, but said it’s still “studying the technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8X0Iu"&gt;I can’t rightfully claim that Bluetooth is as meaningful a change as more legroom or safer flights, but for an airline industry hoarding cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363675/delta-america-united-airlines-layoffs-cash-covid-19-losses-loans-cares-act"&gt;to make it through the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and looking to entice frequent flyers to earn their miles again, any snazzy new feature can’t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Twitter bug temporarily removed the option to switch to the chronological feed on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_kKNyOL4GiS4IiwA2qBqjxVpuSQ=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521285/IMG_1908.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our friend, for whom we feared the worst today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFD8P2"&gt;Twitter has fixed a bug that left some of us horrified when we opened the site (as is often the case, but for different reasons) — those viewing the social network in a web browser found that they &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/twitter-ditching-latest-chronological-feed-option-on-the-web-still-available-on-ios-for-now/"&gt;no longer had the option to switch between&lt;/a&gt; the algorithmic view and the reverse-chronological one. The algorithmic view, which shows tweets out of order, has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;much maligned since it first appeared&lt;/a&gt;, and the bug on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1409976275440185354?s=20"&gt;had people worried&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter was finally starting to force it on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeIaKm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?s=19"&gt;Twitter’s support account says&lt;/a&gt; that web users should be able to change their timeline order again, and a few of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;have confirmed that the button is back on our timelines. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1409981506055929857?s=20"&gt;Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour&lt;/a&gt; called the toggle’s disappearance a “bug,” reiterating what a company spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cntMqD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweets in chronological order on web has been fixed –– the option to switch your Home timeline view to latest Tweets first was removed for some of you on web. We’ve fixed this and the option should now be available again for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1409983835245326336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSqZZh"&gt;Adding to the confusion, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;page explaining the timeline&lt;/a&gt; has a bullet saying that switching between top tweets (aka tweets served up algorithmically) and latest tweets is a feature that’s only available on iOS and Android. Some took this to mean that the option was really going away, but it turns out that the line has been there for years, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190203140705/https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline"&gt;according to the WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible the line is just a holdover from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145089/twitter-latest-tweets-toggle-ranked-feed-timeline-algorithm"&gt;when the “sparkle” button was first introduced&lt;/a&gt;, because it conflicts with information that shows up later in the article: Twitter includes instructions on how to change your timeline order for the web at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CKdSQmJDV6InO9pm2Qg1Fc1BuQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689668/Screen_Shot_2021_06_29_at_2.39.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline" target="_blank"&gt;Instructions: Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s instructions for changing your timeline direction on web, Android, and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ogjqta"&gt;If Twitter has a plan for doing away with the option to view a chronological timeline, it doesn’t seem like it’ll be carrying it out today. For some, that news may come as a mixed bag — maybe being forced to use an algorithmic timeline was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/1409967220650692609?s=20"&gt;the best way to kick a bad habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYXW7N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Extremely glad that Twitter removed the "Latest Tweets" option and is forcing everyone to use their algorithm because now I will spend way less time on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1409949383362289669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Hasan Piker on the problem with YouTube debate culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wf9mi_iyM0HhWRZysFvCy0MmUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521065/acastro_210623_4645_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QFGFK7"&gt;Last week, a pair of YouTube’s most popular creators was set to spar in the marketplace of ideas &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/sam-seder-surprises-steven-crowder-ethan-klein-debate-youtube-2021-6"&gt;in a debate&lt;/a&gt; over the government’s simple, common sense advice to wear masks during a global pandemic to stop the persistent spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97s7R"&gt;The spat grew from a series of videos between right-wing provocateur Steven Crowder and the host of the &lt;em&gt;H3 Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, Ethan Klein, calling one another out for their purported bad takes on mask-wearing. In March, Crowder called out Klein for saying that “you shouldn’t think about” what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells you and just wear the mask, rather than criticizing the agency and its scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UakhL0"&gt;Crowder, who is widely known as the face of the “change my mind” meme, has challenged people to debates in the past, including college students on campuses all across the country. Klein, known for his comedy skits and pop culture commentary, is admittedly not the best debater. So instead of debating Crowder himself, Klein looped in Sam Seder, popular leftist host of &lt;em&gt;The Majority Report&lt;/em&gt;, as a surprise guest to take his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlYqWU"&gt;The “debate” immediately flamed out. Once Seder appeared on-screen, Crowder got squirrelly, slinging insults, and ultimately ditching the entire debate. Soon after recording, both Crowder and Klein released the footage. Both believed to have won by “owning” the other so publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lupA4"&gt;The whole fiasco raised serious questions about debate culture online and how platforms like YouTube and Twitch are influencing politics at large. I asked &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/style/hasan-piker-twitch.html"&gt;Hasan Piker&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Twitch commentator and former &lt;em&gt;Young Turks &lt;/em&gt;broadcast&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist, to talk about it. Piker has been a vocal critic of debate culture without shying away from his channel’s political clout. As he tells it, the “debate me” challenge is just a branding exercise — and it’s one he’s increasingly willing to skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp3nBI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPh8SA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to the Steven Crowder and Sam Seder debate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZqTt"&gt;Personally, I think all of this is just bullshit. I’ve done debates on the internet, and it’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive. I think it can help start a lot of people down the road of deradicalization, but what I have to recognize is that it fosters a really toxic environment. People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top dog debater is. So it turns into team sports. It’s not necessarily grounding your ideology in materialism, and instead, it’s just basically repeating talking points from the new intellectual daddy or father figure that you appreciate or enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWZ4vB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting you bring that up — the concept of team sports. When I watched the “debate” last week, my mind went straight to the Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley debates in the late ’60s. It felt like a moment where culture was beginning to override ideas, largely due to television as the medium for political debate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTCZAB"&gt;I’ll tell you another thing that’s ironic about the Vidal-Buckley debates. Those debates can be TLDR’d into one of them calling the other “queer” as a pejorative and then the other calls the other a “fascist.” If we look at that as the peak of intellectual debates, even back then, ultimately, they can still be reduced to the same shit-slinging operation. And you’re right, it is all about culture and personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVLXBe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of the debate last week, how do you think YouTube as a medium influenced the discussion? Each person was recording and could shape the discussion by changing the camera angles, muting someone, or turning their volume down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCEbqa"&gt;That’s a really unique perspective. I obviously talked about that on stream, but I never thought of the broader implications of it or considered how one-sided that is. It plays into the uneven playing field of the argument. Those decisions to alter camera angles were a deliberate attempt by Steven Crowder to stop his audience from recognizing what had happened in an effort to silence and seize full control ... And that was done in an effort to make himself seem more defensible in the eyes of his audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ytzm1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet has revolutionized the way people get their information. But at the same time, do you think it allows creators to control the narrative and decide their own winner on their platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQy63q"&gt;These debates are rarely about ideas, but instead a personal branding project. That’s probably why it hit so hard for Crowder to try and defend himself. Sorry, I’m simultaneously downloading &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to be playing that later on stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtzR6q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMAGLC"&gt;It’s probably dog shit. I hate golf. But it’s whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCWgaJ"&gt;Oh, yeah. For Steven Crowder, who has built his entire branding about how he is an intellectual type, much like Ben Shapiro has built his brand around being a guy who does debates and defeats liberals in the marketplace of ideas — it hits different. That’s why he had significantly more to lose. That’s what was going on. That’s why he had to take all the actions he did, and that’s why he kept dodging Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VLvb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now I want to get into a conversation about why you do what you do. I know there are a lot of people my age who get their news online and through these streamers. How do you feel about that responsibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e3mNG"&gt;It’s definitely something I think about a lot. I have a pretty stable moral grounding and worldview, and I try to do right by everyone and be as transparent as possible. I communicate that I do have biases just like everyone else. It’s pretty obvious when you come in. I do criticize the Democratic Party quite frequently and the Republican Party even more frequently than that. But that doesn’t mean I’m providing this purely neutral objective analysis. I think all the people who claim to be doing that are lying and benefiting from having the default position be neoliberal capitalism. If there’s injustice and you’re taking a neutral position in the face of injustice, you’re siding with the oppressor. You’re still not neutral. That’s my take on it. That’s why I do my commentary in the way that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNomD2"&gt;I try my best as humanly possible to read up in the limited amount of time I have leading up to a stream to prepare for the stream itself. And on top of that, I’m actively trying to make sure that I’m not misinforming anyone. I also have a pretty solid checking mechanism. If you’ve been in chat long enough, you know that as much as people like to talk about safe spaces or an echo chamber that I’ve cultivated in my community, I am not averse to criticism. I thrive in it. I love it. I look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrtP5I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see streaming and YouTube becoming more popular with younger people looking for new pundits and news online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS6pJ4"&gt;Well, there’s still going to be a need for journalists to make the news. I hope that never changes. I do worry that like — I’m an idiot. I’m an asshole. I don’t want the entire news media to be comprised of other idiot assholes like me. I know that what I do is basically supposed to be the reward after a career of doing journalism, and I get that. Op-eds are supposed to be rewards that you give to people who did 25 years out in like combat zones, for the most part sharking State Department propaganda and lying to them and stuff like that. Still, those people are putting in the work, and they finally get their comfortable office gig in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;or another reputable place, and then that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkyDNO"&gt;Now, what I do is a way to completely bypass that and even go beyond the office-gig economy, which is now turning into Substack and stuff like that. But if everyone wanted to do that, it would ruin everything. I still believe that journalists, like real journalists, should do real news, which I am not. I am not a real journalist. I’m not doing real news. I’m a commentator. I hope that never goes away. That would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIiNt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people that you’re interacting with on Twitch in chat, you’re accountable to them. They might unsubscribe. What’s that relationship like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjS7Vc"&gt;For the degenerate dumbasses that are op-ed writers and commentators like myself, what I do is absolutely a million times harder. I will say this with my chest: what I do, it looks like I’m sitting in a living room and shooting the shit, it is very easy. I’m not going to a fucking coal mine. But in comparison to what Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss do, what I do is a million times more difficult if you are so used to being in an ivory tower where you get very little criticism. All you need to do is just shut it off. Like your comments under your &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article are not going to drastically redefine your op-ed piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5N6RXH"&gt;My entire content revolves around constant back-and-forth communication, and it’s a very different layer of trying to control that. But I love that. I think that’s a good thing. As far as the take economy goes, I think what I do is pretty solid. I think it’s a good thing to have endless amounts of feedback from virtually every single person who wishes to do so, which is why I don’t have a sub-only feed. Some communities, when they grow to my size, the streamer will shut down their chat to subscriber-only. I don’t do that on purpose because I want to have these sorts of conversations with people, and I don’t want the money to prevent them from happening. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk counts on 500,000 Starlink users within the next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MWC Barcelona 2021 Trade Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gjy3uQRXWeJKllICy9n96k6-j38=/0x0:1761x1174/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521037/1326124843.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANxurW"&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet network, Starlink, should have roughly 500,000 users within the next 12 months, Elon Musk said at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference on Tuesday. SpaceX’s current goal, Musk said, is to beam broadband internet to most of the planet by August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCmuot"&gt;The internet network, in the midst of an open beta phase, has launched more than 1,700 satellites to low-Earth orbit since 2018 and recently surpassed a “strategically significant” benchmark of 69,420 active users, Musk told MWC. He said Starlink is already running in 12 countries and expanding. “We’re I think on our way to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v8Y69"&gt;Reaching half a million users in the next year and unlocking global internet coverage — minus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22350643/oneweb-spacex-racing-broadband-internet-arctic-military"&gt;Arctic regions&lt;/a&gt; — in the next two months is a wildly ambitious goal for Starlink. The internet service will be sold directly to consumers in the world’s most rural areas and to governments looking for better military internet connections (among other customers). Many individual users are paying $99 per month for internet under the beta, using a $499 bundle of a self-aligning Starlink dish and Wi-Fi router. SpaceX is promising 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds. Reviews so far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;have been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/spacexs-starlink-early-users-review-service-internet-speed-price.html"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzC5xu"&gt;Challenges abound on the path to opening up commercial service and providing global internet coverage. While the cost of each Starlink terminal is $499 for consumers, Musk admitted at the conference that each terminal costs SpaceX double that, over $1,000. The company has already cut the terminal cost in half from $3,000 and is aiming to reduce it to the “few hundred dollar range within the next year or two,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in April. Musk maintained a key goal for SpaceX is avoiding bankruptcy as it passes through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;deep chasm&lt;/a&gt; of negative cash flow. Starlink’s main competitor, OneWeb, filed for — and since recovered from — bankruptcy last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QgSXP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Filling in the gaps between 5G and fiber”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPNlp7"&gt;Musk said the Starlink team has signed deals with two “major country” telecom operators, but he didn’t name them. He considers Starlink to be “complementary” to existing 5G providers rather than directly competing with them. “You can think of Starlink as filling in the gaps between 5G and fiber and really getting to the parts of the world that are the hardest to reach,” he said. Asked how much he’ll have to invest in Starlink, Musk said it depends how you define investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y23pug"&gt;“Before we go to positive cash flow, it’ll be at least $5 billion, and maybe as much as $10 [billion]. So it’s quite a lot,” he said, adding, “We’ll have to keep investing a great deal after that point” to remain relevant among competitors. The total Starlink investment will round out to $20–30 billion, he said. Once the network is fully up and running, SpaceX hopes it could generate around &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/exclusive-peek-at-spacex-data-shows-loss-in-2015-heavy-expectations-for-nascent-internet-service-1484316455"&gt;$30 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenue with Starlink and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126540/spacex-starlink-internet-space-mega-constellation-ipo-spinoff-gwynne-shotwell"&gt;split it off from SpaceX for an IPO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pE4xRN"&gt;Most of that revenue will fund SpaceX’s Starship system, the centerpiece of Musk’s ambitions to ferry humans to the Moon and Mars. Musk, known for tossing around wildly ambitious development timelines, said at the conference that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434825/elon-musk-spacex-first-orbital-starship-test-texas-hawaii"&gt;the first orbital Starship test launch&lt;/a&gt; could come sometime in “the next few months” — a slightly different timetable than July, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/spacex-aims-to-launch-first-orbital-starship-flight-in-july.html"&gt;Shotwell said at a conference&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Qipt"&gt;“There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1409963681807544320?s=20"&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; to one reporter on Twitter. “Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp;amp; there will be external issues too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJi718"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal agencies use facial recognition from private companies, but almost nobody is keeping track</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facial Recognition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ix5npEQAdLth6W36LrJzLcdWpEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520937/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mQxuse"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-518"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has revealed near-total lack of accountability from federal agencies using facial recognition built by private companies, like Clearview AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKUGTr"&gt;Of the 14 federal agencies that said they used privately built facial recognition for criminal investigations, only Immigration and Customs Enforcement was in the process of implementing a list of approved facial recognition vendors and a log sheet for the technology’s use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BB8Lq4"&gt;The rest of the agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, had no process in place to track the use of private facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoIhkV"&gt;This GAO report greatly expands the public’s knowledge of how the federal government uses facial recognition more broadly by distilling which agencies use facial recognition built by the government, which are using third-party vendors, and how large those datasets are in each case. Of 42 federal agencies surveyed, 20 told the oversight agency they used facial recognition in some form, most relying on federal systems maintained by the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HV02ll"&gt;These federal systems can hold a staggering amount of identities: the Department of Homeland Security’s &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/biometrics"&gt;Automated Biometric Identification System&lt;/a&gt; holds more than 835 million identities, according to the GAO report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApjUk2"&gt;Federal agencies were also asked how they used this technology during racial justice protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, as well as the Capitol Hill riot on January 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aq711b"&gt;Six agencies, including the FBI, US Marshals Service, and Postal Inspection Service, used facial recognition on “individuals suspected of violating the law” in protests last summer. Three agencies used the technology investigating the riot on January 6th: Capitol Police, Customs and Border Protection, and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. However, some information was withheld from the GAO investigators as it pertained to active investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk2kYh"&gt;The use of this technology on protestors and rioters shows how critical it is to have accountability mechanisms in place. The GAO explains if these agencies don’t know which facial recognition services they’re using, they have no way to mitigate the enormous privacy, security, or accuracy risks inherent in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY4hkH"&gt;“When agencies use facial recognition technology without first assessing the privacy implications and applicability of privacy requirements, there is a risk that they will not adhere to privacy-related laws, regulations, and policies,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4t7N"&gt;In one case, GAO investigators asked a federal agency if it was using facial recognition built by private companies, and the agency said it was not. But after an internal poll, the unnamed agency learned that employees had run such facial recognition searches more than 1,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX4XTd"&gt;Going forward, the GAO has issued 26 recommendations to federal agencies on the continued use of facial recognition. They consist of two identical recommendations for each of the 13 agencies without an accountability mechanism in place: Figure out which facial recognition systems you’re using, and then study the risks of each.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juul and the business of addiction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/osqSd454ORhUH585iGW5LKnFc-U=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520820/VRG_ILLO_4652_Decoder_Lauren_Etter_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg’s Lauren Etter on the rise and decline of an e-cigarette upstart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uqYve5"&gt;Several years ago, I went to a splashy launch party for a new tech product, which is a pretty normal thing for tech companies to have. It was at a hip warehouse space in Manhattan, there was cool lighting and a great DJ, free food — the company had pulled out all the stops. And the company had invited a ton of Instagram influencers and model types, so there were lots of beautiful young people there doing exactly what the company had hoped they’d do: taking photos and videos with the new product, talking about how cool it was, and posting it to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRDx0C"&gt;Now, if I was talking about a new smartphone, or a camera, or a laptop, this party would not have stuck out in my mind, but this party was for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/juul"&gt;a product called the Juul&lt;/a&gt;. And the Juul was — and still is — one of the most potent and effective nicotine delivery devices that’s ever been created. Juul’s big innovation was a nicotine formulation that made its vape hit just like a cigarette. And the party kicked off a marketing blitz that seemed pretty directly targeted toward teenagers on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZNHq3"&gt;After that, the Juul became a sensation — and a sensationally dramatic story. The marketing helped, but also it turns out nicotine is addictive as hell. A Stanford tech startup that had been founded to disrupt the smoking industry had upended years of US tobacco regulation, gotten a new generation of teenagers addicted to nicotine after years of declining smoking rates, and eventually found itself valued at $38 billion after a huge $12.8 billion investment from Altria — the company that used to be called Philip Morris. You probably know it by its most famous product: Marlboro cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5K94A"&gt;Then it all fell apart: the lawsuits came, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203670/ftc-sues-to-unwind-altrias-12-8-billion-investment-in-juul"&gt;the FTC sued to unwind the deal&lt;/a&gt;, the valuations of both Juul and Altria collapsed, and Juul itself faces being regulated entirely out of the market in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4QjCg"&gt;How did this all happen? How did a startup that was founded to stop smoking end up in the pocket of Marlboro? How did Altria screw up this investment so badly? And how did a couple of Stanford kids figure out a better cigarette before the cigarette industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQRVmg"&gt;To find out, I invited Lauren Etter on the show. Lauren is an investigative reporter at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; and the author of a new book called &lt;em&gt;The Devil’s Playbook: Big Tobacco, Juul, and the Addiction of a New Generation&lt;/em&gt;. Lauren tells us the story of how the cigarette industry went from hiding and lying about research that showed nicotine was addictive to being one of the most regulated industries in the country — and then, how that provided an opening for Juul to do things the cigarette companies could never get away with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDgovV"&gt;The book is terrific — even if you don’t care about nicotine and smoking, if you’re a &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; listener, you’re going to recognize a lot of themes in this conversation. There’s a big industry that’s slow to adapt, there’s a startup that’s moving fast and breaking things, there are regulators around the world who don’t quite know what to do, and at the center of it all, there’s a big question about our society’s relationship with a product that might be bad for people — and that people still want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFDlDc"&gt;Just a couple days after we recorded this episode news broke that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554290/juul-north-carolina-lawsuit-settlement-teen-vaping-marketing"&gt;Juul has agreed to settle a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; brought by the state of North Carolina that claimed the company’s marketing practices caused a sharp rise in vaping among minors. Juul will pay a $40 million settlement, but it’s also agreed to something else: it won’t use anyone under the age of 35 in its marketing anymore. The party is officially over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XwRnIM"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8617557070" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3epf0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBoU8o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is your first book, and I have to say it was a very impressive first book. We covered the Juul story at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as a tech story, but you’ve written a health story, a really complicated business and regulatory story, and also the story of the tobacco industry and what it has become in this country. How did you start looking at Juul in this way, and how did you end up writing a book about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uPUWd"&gt;I started writing about Juul after the outbreak of lung injuries, this mysterious outbreak called EVALI [e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury]. I started writing about it from a health perspective and trying to figure out what was going on, just like the rest of the nation trying to figure [this] out. Is this related to vaping? So I started covering some of those stories, and then I became interested in Juul as a business story. It was fascinating to me that a company that had found itself in the middle of this public health crisis was a Silicon Valley firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENyewP"&gt;As I embarked on a book, I was really endeavoring to tell the story of Juul, but I quickly realized it was impossible to tell the complete story of Juul without telling the story of the tobacco industry. Those two industries were so intimately intertwined that it became evident to me that I needed to also write about the tobacco industry. That’s why I ended up with these two intertwined narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xv9OZe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give people the really short version of the Juul story. This is a famous product. It was all over the news. Lots of people use a Juul, but it has a really sharp rise, and then a really sharp fall. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzoD9F"&gt;Most people know about Juul having launched in the summer of 2015 with this flashy nicotine device called Juul, and quickly taking off and taking over the entire industry and leading to a youth health crisis. All the teenagers started using it. But actually, the founders of Juul had been working on coming up with a better, healthier, less harmful alternative to the cigarette for years before Juul. Adam Bowen and James Monsees, two Stanford grad students, started working on... it’s almost like a myth and a legend by now. A lot of people know this story. They met at Stanford, in the design school. They were smoking cigarettes out back as they kind of pondered their next project, and they realized that it was idiotic to be smoking this burning stick, essentially shredded tobacco leaf rolled in paper, lit on fire. The same product that people had been using for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I6HuD"&gt;And here they are in the heart of Silicon Valley, where everything is ripe for innovation. And they realized, why hasn’t the cigarette been innovated on? So they set out to innovate the cigarette. As they embarked on that, they found some of these old tobacco documents that had surfaced during the 1990s in the heat of the tobacco wars, and there were millions of documents that the tobacco companies had to hand over, to make public, as a result of litigation that had nearly buried them. They tapped into that, and had many, many iterations of their product before it became Juul. It launched in 2015, ultimately, and just became the most popular e-cigarette on the market. They marketed it on social media, on Instagram, on Facebook, on Twitter. They sent kind of traveling troupes of these nicotine Juul marketers that handed out free samples at parties, on yachts, in the Hamptons, at raves, and it just became extremely popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZaebu"&gt;It became popular among 20-year-olds, and among teenagers as well, middle school and high school students. So that was the moment, as it became just a runaway success, that it attracted the attention of public health regulators, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-new-enforcement-actions-and-youth-tobacco-prevention?utm_campaign=04242018_Statement_Youth+Tobacco+Prevention&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Eloqua"&gt;of the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, of members of Congress. It just became this huge issue, where Scott Gottlieb, the then-FDA commissioner, called it an epidemic of youth usage. So basically, the company found itself under this incredible scrutiny from every angle. And at the same time, the traditional tobacco industry had also been trying to innovate on cigarettes, their declining business. The cigarette had been in decline for decades. Everybody agreed that the business was only going to continue to decline as people realized the adverse health effects of smoking, and it was not as cool to smoke cigarettes anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xeYU39"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6qVJQ"&gt;And so as big tobacco tries to innovate, they cannot out-innovate Silicon Valley. So at the end of the day, Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/20/altria-takes-stake-in-juul-a-pivotal-moment-for-the-e-cigarette-maker.html"&gt;decides to invest in Juul&lt;/a&gt;. In my book, I write that was the moment the glass shattered for Juul. It just attracted so much scrutiny, because all of these years, the founders of Juul had been saying, “We are the anti-cigarette. We’re going to kill the cigarette. We’re going to kill the tobacco industry,” and suddenly they’re in bed with the tobacco industry. That really kind of put them on blast in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86997v"&gt;They were under health regulators’ scrutiny, and their valuation, which once stood at $38 billion, was just tumbling quarter after quarter after quarter. And now, there’s been a huge reorganization in the company. They brought in all these new executives, many from the tobacco industry, and they’re essentially fighting for their survival right now. Juul, like every other e-cigarette maker, has submitted an application to the FDA, and now the FDA has to determine whether or not it’s in the public health’s interest to allow this product to continue to be marketed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PP5Nj"&gt;Basically, we’re all waiting. It’s expected sometime this year, for the FDA to decide whether or not it can be sold. If the FDA does not allow it to go forward, Juul has no product to sell. And if it does, I think Juul is well-positioned to continue to grow and take over the market. So they’re at a real inflection point right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92bo7y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is just a staggering rise and fall. It’s two kids at Stanford looking at a product that they’re using, doing the tech industry thing, asking this kind of hilarious bubble question of, “Why hasn’t anybody innovated this thing,” realizing that actually lots of people have tried to innovate it, using some of that, and then all the way to now potentially facing regulatory doom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl92eJ"&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLEbhN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big innovation with Juul was not really the design or the pods. It was the nicotine formulation. How did they stumble on a nicotine formulation that hits like a cigarette? Because early vapes were really, really harsh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRfCC5"&gt;This is Juul’s secret sauce, the nicotine salts, of course. Early [e-cigarettes], what they did was they essentially just took nicotine and they added some flavors to it. But the problem with just using nicotine is, it’s extremely harsh. It has a high pH level. It burns your throat. Early iterations of e-cigarettes, they could only put in small amounts of nicotine so it wouldn’t be so aversive to your lungs. The problem with that was that it didn’t satisfy smokers. because there wasn’t enough nicotine in it. So they’d have to puff and puff and puff on the thing and it just wouldn’t deliver the satisfaction. So, that had been the number one complaint by e-cigarette users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojc2Se"&gt;So, Adam and James, they had done tons of research. They had delved into these tobacco archives, which contained all kinds of science about nicotine and about tobacco. The science of tobacco smoke and nicotine chemistry is extremely complicated and complex, and they were able to use some early research that showed if you modify the pH levels of tobacco smoke you can deliver different satisfaction levels, enjoyment levels, that type of thing. There’s also a body of research that showed, if you add organic acids to nicotine, it lowers the pH but you can have higher levels of nicotine. Essentially, by adding the organic acids, you create a nicotine salt, and that allows the pH to go lower, but you have a higher amount of nicotine. So what that does is enable you to inhale a large amount of nicotine without burning your throat, without you starting to cough a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9orvT"&gt;I should also point out that they hired tobacco industry scientists. They had them on speed dial. They would call them and they would ask about the different various organic acids and how that could modulate the pH. And they did all kinds of research and they absolutely turned to tobacco industry executives and to the tobacco files, the archives, to help them solve the problem. They eventually did their own experimentation in Dogpatch in their offices there, where they were adding various organic acids to nicotine to see what the most satisfying ones were. And they ended up going to New Zealand where they did their own tests on human subjects, including on Adam Bowen himself, to determine which organic acid in nicotine would give you the highest level of satisfaction, and what would make your heart race the fastest. When you take these little surveys, what would be the most satisfying one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeuyZ1"&gt;So they did all kinds of just really organic research and ended up settling on benzoic acid as the organic acid that was the most satisfying. This enabled them to do something that no other company had really done, which is devise a nicotine solution that had a high nicotine content, in this case 5 percent, which was ultimately marketed, but with a very low aversive component to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQYayn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/21/18105969/juul-vaping-nicotine-salts-electronic-cigarettes-myblu-vuse-markten"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They picked benzoic acid. They have a patent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The patent lists every other kind of acid you might want to use down to citric acid. That prevents anyone else from doing this, right? Was that it? Was there another way around this problem? Because when I first saw that patent, I was like, “Oh, Juul’s going to win. Now they can block everybody else from doing the thing that made their product better than everybody else.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5fI2z"&gt;There’s definitely been IP litigation over this. And there probably will be in the future. I just don’t know how much Juul is going to be able to prevail on essentially owning chemistry. This is basic organic chemistry. I don’t know if it, at first glance, gives them the patent protection or the IP protection, that you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmdgzB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really interested in that arc and sort of pulling apart the bits and pieces of that, but what struck me about your book is that you don’t start with Juul at all. You start with Altria, which is the company that was known as Philip Morris, that made Marlboro, and you start with them in sort of the very late ’90s, early 2000s. And it seems like what the entire cigarette industry was struggling with was, we’re going to be a regulated industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LM4uWb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ll be intertwined with government regulators. We’ll be intertwined with health officials. We have to learn to be that kind of company where the government is kind of always up in our shit. Tell me about that, because there’s a really big parallel, not in terms of the product, but in terms of the attitudinal shift that the entire tech industry is facing right now. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEl9v1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You and I are talking, and Congress is literally talking, about antitrust bills, simultaneously with our discussion today. But it just feels like that attitude shift created the opportunity for someone to not have the baggage and make the Juul, when if Philip Morris had invented the Juul, I mean, their business would have been secured in a different way, but they were just unable to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K869YE"&gt;Yes, that’s exactly right. I started the book in the middle of a hurricane in Puerto Rico, because I felt like it was emblematic of what the industry was going through, the tobacco industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3EzCl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book starts in the middle of a hurricane. You were not in the middle of a hurricane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsskyS"&gt;Right, correct. The book starts in the middle of a hurricane in Puerto Rico, and Philip Morris, the company now known as Altria, had gathered all of its corporate relations officials and executives, and met there as kind of a retreat to talk about this huge moment in the industry where they had to admit that they had deceived the American people, that they had lied, that they had covered up all of this information and evidence about how deadly cigarette smoking was, and it had all come out into the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiJwk3"&gt;The FDA commissioner, David Kessler, at the time, had made it his mission to go after the tobacco industry to bring it under its regulatory authority for the first time. State attorneys general were suing the tobacco industry and the tobacco companies for all of the public health effects and the costs related to treating smoking-related disease, and every week there was a new headline on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times about the misdeeds of the tobacco industry in the ’90s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STDSTG"&gt;It really was this important moment that I thought almost paralleled where we are today with Juul. So, they realized that they needed to have this permission to exist, and Juul essentially finds itself in the exact same position now, where they’re kind of operating only if the FDA gives them permission to operate. They’ve realized that they created a youth usage crisis, or helped create it, and that they have to be incredibly careful about it. But the interesting thing is that when Juul launched, when Adam and James decided to innovate on the cigarette, they had none of that baggage that the tobacco industry had. They had not been through the trenches, and they didn’t approach the industry — this highly addictive product, nicotine — they didn’t approach it with the necessary care in order to give their product a chance at surviving and asking permission from society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Secb3N"&gt;It’s like the motto of Silicon Valley, “Move fast and break things. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.” And that’s exactly the mentality that they embodied early on when they launched Juul, and it’s also the mentality that allowed them to crush the market, to take over, and to basically flood the nation with Juul. So there are lots of similarities, lots of parallels between those two narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgoRXk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, let me ask you about that, because the lack of baggage enabled them to make a product that Philip Morris and the other big tobacco companies had been trying to invent for years, and because of their own regulatory problems and their own wacky international corporate structures, they weren’t really able to do it well. And the Juul team had none of that baggage. They were able to say, “What people want is nicotine,” which the tobacco companies really could not say, given the regulatory scrutiny. And then they were able to deliver the nicotine salt formula in the pods of the Juul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XGl5x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think a lot of people will tell you they’re very happy using a Juul instead of smoking a cigarette, and that is probably a net good, although I have some questions about that too. The thing that I struggle with in this entire story is, “Well, it’s better than smoking.” And so if the tobacco companies were not able to make this product, is it a net good thing that a startup that made a lot of mistakes along the way didn’t need to ask permission to exist, eventually did develop a product that is, in some measurable way, better than smoking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg9nTR"&gt;You’re hitting on the exact controversy, and I think it’s super important to talk about it in this way. First of all, it’s partly a socio-cultural question about nicotine. Why do people use nicotine? Why do they want to use nicotine? It provides pleasure. I mean, it does lots of great things. It provides pleasure. It can help you concentrate. It can help you focus. It can relax you. There are all kinds of appealing aspects to nicotine, I should point out, and this is also a very important point, it’s not the nicotine in cigarettes that kills people. Nicotine has some adverse health effects, but largely not many. There are even some studies showing that nicotine can help in the treatment of serious diseases, including Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnkG5A"&gt;But what kills people when they smoke cigarettes, the deadly aspect of a cigarette, is the combustion. And this is kind of the thing that Adam and James focus on, is the combustion. It’s the lighting on fire, the burning, inhaling these toxic chemicals that form tar droplets that end up affecting the lining of your lungs and causing lung disease. So people smoke cigarettes because they want nicotine. Why do people want nicotine? Well, they’re addicted to it. I think the addiction element is sort of the most important and most interesting aspect to focus on, because what’s so bad about nicotine? Well, you could potentially become a lifelong user of nicotine. So I think when we’re talking about adult smokers, we know the reason they smoke is because of the nicotine. They want the nicotine fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbvlp7"&gt;So why not give them a better, less harmful alternative that doesn’t involve combustion? And that’s the e-cigarette. So it sounds great. I will point out that there haven’t been enough long-term clinical studies to show that there are zero adverse health effects. I think most people agree, and most studies show, that there is a net benefit if you quit smoking and only use e-cigarettes. A lot of e-cigarette users also continue to smoke cigarettes. That’s called dual use. If you’re an adult smoker and you just switch from cigarettes to Juul, for example, you’re probably better off in the long run. The issue revolves around the kids, teens, and young people who become attracted to the product and develop a lifetime nicotine addiction. If you can separate that controversy out from the adult usage issue, then the industry would be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqvaaG"&gt;I think that’s the industry’s plan. The e-cigarette industry’s plan to survive is to focus on the adult smoker. So, back in the 1990s at the height of the tobacco wars, almost 40 percent of teens smoked cigarettes. They were tobacco users. By 2015, when Juul launched, it was down to like 10 percent. So it had been this huge public health coup that they had successfully gotten the youth tobacco use rate down to such a low percentage. So when Juul launched, and other e-cigarettes as well, suddenly you saw this rapid increase in the number of teenagers who were using e-cigarettes. Now, yes, better than a cigarette, but [they’re] still adopting a nicotine habit. Can you prevent youth from getting addicted to nicotine? Because I think most people agree that there’s no real redeeming quality for a teenager to just start using nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qIjAS3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s never been about anything else but nicotine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vRYBuR"&gt;First of all, their brains are not fully developed. There’s all kinds of science and studies showing that nicotine, before your brain is developed, can have all kinds of adverse health effects on brain development. You become more addicted because the pathways in your brain become solidified, and so you develop a greater addictive potential. It’s really a question about, who’s the problem? Where does the problem lie? If we’re talking about youth usage, then I think most people would agree that we don’t want kids adopting a new nicotine habit. But if you’re talking about current cigarette smokers, there’s a pretty compelling case to say that a less harmful product that does not involve combustion, like an e-cigarette, can actually have a net benefit to society. So the problem for Juul was that they didn’t set up the opportunity for themselves to initially go after the adult smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MspX9m"&gt;They ruined their opportunity early on by essentially committing the cardinal sin in America, which is contributing to a new youth nicotine epidemic. I think those two issues often get conflated, and people start yelling over one another. They’re kind of talking about different things, but unfortunately they’re intertwined. There’s a moment in my book where I interviewed Mike Moore, the former famous attorney general who in the 1990s took on the tobacco industry, and he described it to me in a way that I thought was really interesting. He said, “Companies have made billions of dollars getting people to suck something into their lungs.” He says, “I hate to say it so clear, but how could you possibly sell that? There’s only one answer, and the answer is nicotine. It’s never been about anything else but nicotine. Without it, there’s nothing. There’s no cigarettes, there’s no Juul, there’s none of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgJ98V"&gt;That was a powerful conversation, because it highlights and underscores just how dependent these industries are on addiction. One other thing that’s important to point out is that 90 percent of adult smokers today began smoking before the age of 18. Ninety-nine percent began smoking before the age of 25. The whole concept dating back to the 1990s was, if you can cut off the youth from nicotine addiction, you won’t have a next generation of users. From a public health standpoint, that’s fantastic, because then they wouldn’t be smoking cigarettes. For the tobacco industry, that’s a complete disaster, because that means if they do not have the next generation of users, they do not have an industry that has a long life. So for me, the controversial issue is less about whether adult smokers should be using e-cigarettes to quit smoking, and more about the continuation of nicotine addiction that continues to addict new generations of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BRvkI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of the scrutiny around Juul occurred because of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897560/vaping-lung-injury-toll-cdc-investigation-fda-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vaping-related illnesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and deaths that were happening in the Midwest. That led to a crisis of “is vaping bad?”, which is yet another track from “is nicotine bad?” It’s another way to conflate all this. Is vaping bad? What was the result of all that? And how did Juul get caught up in it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sq0pIu"&gt;When the lung injury outbreak happened, everybody just assumed it was Juul, or at least it was vaping, because basically you had these kids showing up to hospitals who had chronic lung injury, almost as if their lungs had been burned, and they were on breathing machines and that type of thing. It was a very serious problem. And then you had adults showing up at the emergency rooms, the same thing. They had these chronic lung injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9IEnN"&gt;I think immediately the media attention gravitated toward Juul because Juul was the most popular product on the market. Juul had been singled out as the one causing the youth vaping epidemic. And now suddenly you have all these kids who vaped showing up at the emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBbzpa"&gt;So it was a huge PR crisis for Juul, and the CEO at the time had this fateful interview where he went on national television and said, “We just don’t know. We don’t know if vaping is safe.” But as the FDA and the CDC began their investigation into the lung injuries, over months, it took them months to figure out that it probably was linked to bootlegged THC products that were being vaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVQQFx"&gt;So these were pods that were laced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955446/cdc-vaping-breakthrough-lung-injury-investigation"&gt;this product called vitamin E acetate&lt;/a&gt;, which is a syrupy, golden liquid that a lot of the bootlegged products were cut with in order to either make it more syrupy or in order to make it last longer, to go further. And so the CDC ultimately said it was most likely related to these products that contained this ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mr3mjm"&gt;By the time that the CDC got around to announcing that, the damage had already been done for Juul. Their product had taken such a hit on the market, people were so spooked by vaping and by Juul-ing, that by the time that the CDC clarified things, it was too late. There were all sorts of people who were furious at the CDC and the FDA for taking so long to come to that conclusion and for wrongly singling out just vaping as the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMay61"&gt;However, I will point out that the CDC, to this day, continues to say that there’s a small percentage of these lung injuries that were tied to nicotine-only products, not the THC products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8q86Y"&gt;Then you heard stories of people who started going back to cigarettes because they were so spooked by the lung injuries. And people saying, “Oh my God, the FDA or the CDC should have cleared this whole thing up earlier.” It was a large misunderstanding, but it was also a catastrophe, and it was really bad for the industry. It was really bad for public health, but it also does underscore that there’s still a lot of research that needs to be done on e-cigarettes to determine if they do cause any long-term health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9sVlX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The focus on nicotine is what enabled Juul to succeed as a company that thought of itself as a tech company, as a disruptive company, in those very heady days of 2015, when tech companies were going to disrupt everything. And they saw a big, lumbering industry. They said, “They don’t even understand their own product. They don’t even understand what they’re selling. We can make it sharper and better with a focus on design, with a focus on delivery, innovation, all of the buzzwords.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhK3vX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Juul a tech company? It seemed like a threshold question for us, right? We’re a tech and science website. We realized we wanted to cover it. And we’re like, well, it’s a tech company. They act like a tech company. They talk like a tech company. Now many years hence, we realize a bunch of those companies were not actually tech companies. WeWork was not a tech company. Was Juul a tech company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jN2jIy"&gt;I think Juul is a tech company, as much as they would like to distance themselves from that now. They sell hardware, there’s software involved, [and] they innovated. They brought to bear the use of technology in order to innovate on a product that had zero technology in it. They disrupted, they raised venture capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xtao6t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a big debate on our team over whether they’re a tech company. And I think for us, what qualifies something as a tech company, is whether you have the margins of a tech company, whether you make a piece of software and sell it over and over again. Juul has a very mechanical product. They have to manufacture the liquid in the pods, they have to manufacture the pods. And they had a lot of, “Oh crap. We make a hardware product with liquid in it,” problems along the way. And that ran right into some very strange regulatory moments that you unpack in the book. I’m curious if you can tell that story and kind of help me understand how they got through it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyWoly"&gt;So essentially, their technology, it’s a battery. It has a little heating element in it. The battery actually heats the pod. You insert the pod and when you suck on it, it triggers the battery to heat up and create the vapor. So, there’s also some electronics inside. What they found early on, and what most e-cigarette companies found, was that the liquid contained in the pod, the nicotine liquid, would leak down into the guts of the Juul device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcdRn"&gt;When you’re a startup and you’re scrappy and you’re trying to gain market share, having these kinds of glitches in the functioning of your technology is very, very problematic. What Juul set out to do was to fix the problem. It wasn’t an easy fix for a variety of reasons. They couldn’t figure out for the life of them why the pods were leaking and how to solve for that issue. They would take the pods on airplanes and over mountain passes in order to figure out, was it the altitude that was causing them to leak? Was there some other design glitch in the manufacturing process that was causing them to leak? But it was a huge problem that they had to solve for internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAVmh6"&gt;The problem for Juul was, at the time, the FDA was cracking down on the industry. And they came out with this law that said, for the e-cigarette companies, that you could continue selling your product, but you couldn’t make any modifications to them. The FDA was essentially trying to freeze the market so there would be no new entrants and they could kind of wrap their arms around this unwieldy market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7gdTbo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Juul took risks tobacco companies wouldn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6LvmX"&gt;So they said, “If you have your product on the market, we’re not going to enforce against you. You can keep selling it until you file this PMTA [premarket tobacco product application] and get the thumbs up or thumbs down from the FDA. But in the meantime, you’re not allowed to make any changes to your product.” I think this is a moment where Juul really embodied the Silicon Valley ideal of move fast and break things, ask for forgiveness, not permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5eXP7"&gt;They actually ended up changing their device. There’s a lot of argument around whether or not the change that they made to the device rose to the technical definition of a modification and whether or not that was a breach of the FDA’s rule. But the fact of the matter is, they did modify their device after what they called the deeming date of August 8th, 2016, at a time when you were not supposed to do it. But Juul was at this moment where they were like, “If we don’t fix this, we’re screwed and we’re going to just get crushed by competitors. But if we do fix it, the FDA will probably never know and they’ll never ask us about it.” And it was a tiny enough modification. They changed the structure of the pod a little bit. They changed some of the internals on the motherboard. They changed some of the way that the product actually worked. They put a new sensor inside of it that would withstand leakage better, that wouldn’t cause it to brick, that type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7edBpy"&gt;I thought that was a really interesting moment for Juul, because the tobacco companies might not have done that even though they face the same risk. And in fact, there was a very heated debate inside Altria because they had a similar kind of leaking issue. And they debated for a long time whether or not it would rise to a modification and be in breach of the FDA’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd3zOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While that’s all happening, Altria is freaking out that Juul exists, that it’s going to steal their market share and destroy their business. They’re paying a lot of attention to Juul. And they’re the ones who find the change before the government finds the change. Why didn’t they just copy the Juul? When I think about big tech companies now, they just relentlessly clone their smaller competitors, all of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3qOMT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t Altria, as it’s looking at the Juul so closely — they’re buying them and realize that they’ve made this change; they’ve already effectively reverse-engineered it to understand what’s going on — why didn’t they just copy the Juul?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9aaQ"&gt;It was a question I just kept asking over and over again. How could Altria have been so behind or so clueless? Exactly your question, I would ask that. And the answer is sort of multifaceted. Altria was, number one, they were late to the game. When they introduced their very first e-cigarette product, they called them “cigalikes.” It was one of those that looked like a cigarette and it had e-liquid inside, but it was really trying to approximate a cigarette. It was cylindrical. It was wrapped even in this paper material, it was white, it had a glowing tip, so when you sucked on it, it looked like a cigarette. That was the first product that they put out on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsM4rw"&gt;That was around 2013, 2014, then Juul hit the market in 2015. And yeah, they start doing the teardowns of Juul, just like they do with any other product; figuring out, “What is this thing? It looks like no other product on the market. We’ve never seen anything like this before.” And they honestly debated for so long whether or not it was going to be a threat to their product and to their industry. And they had different management before Howard Willard, [the current CEO of Altria], took over and ended up doing the deal with Juul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXaLGu"&gt;But at the time, the management was very circumspect about the long-term viability of the e-cigarette market. They thought that regulators were not going to tolerate another nicotine product on the market without going through lots and lots of regulatory hurdles. They believed that this market would not last for long and that they didn’t really need to pour tons and tons of money into it in order to innovate. They already had sort of gone down that road, but a little bit reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dg2Zy"&gt;Altria, their future plan before Juul came around, was that their harm reduction play was going to be in smokeless tobacco and snus. That’s what they were thinking. They were thinking of going in the direction of, people are going to use nicotine in a pouch. When Juul hit the market, they were just kind of already behind the ball, even though they had done decades and decades of research. And by the time they realized it was actually a threat to them, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/rules-regulations-and-guidance/fdas-deeming-regulations-e-cigarettes-cigars-and-all-other-tobacco-products"&gt;the FDA had implemented the deeming rule&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2016. And all the companies were forbidden from putting any new product on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZu48w"&gt;Altria dragged their feet for so long and kind of underestimated the trajectory of the market. By the time that they realized, “Oh shit, Juul is actually this crazy product that’s just eating our market share,” they couldn’t do anything about it. They could not introduce a new product to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyXfwL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the FDA has the deeming rule. At the same time, Altria knows that maybe it could kill Juul by going after the regulators. It seems like the cigarette companies wanted to be seen as the responsible adults, even though they sell cigarettes, and they wanted to cast the tech companies, the vape companies, as being reckless upstarts. At some point, the Trump administration gets involved. The whole thing becomes very politicized, and Altria ends up making this gigantic investment in Juul. How did that all come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsbRaE"&gt;So in this bout of desperation, when Altria is realizing that Juul is an actual threat, they actually start scouring the globe for products that they could just simply buy, that had been on the market prior to August of 2016. They ended up finding this Chinese manufacturer that had this product that they could prove had been on the market prior to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZHrGP"&gt;So they did introduce this, what they deemed to be their competitor to Juul, which was MarkTen Elite. It looked kind of similar to Juul. It had the battery and it had the little pods. This was Altria’s very first pod product. And they didn’t introduce it until, I’m forgetting the date right now. I think it might’ve been 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dno69b"&gt;But the problem with that product is that it was absolutely terrible. It didn’t have the nicotine salts like Juul. It was ugly. It didn’t have the form factor, didn’t have the Silicon Valley je ne sais quoi, and people didn’t really like it. But Altria tried flooding the market with that product. They would figure out, “Where’s Juul doing really well in sales? Let’s go there and just try to cut the price of their product to have this price war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJmPSm"&gt;They really did put up a fight for a while. And they realized that there was no hope. MarkTen Elite was a terrible product. Everybody knew it. It was almost an internal joke where they were just like, “It’s pathetic, that we’re trying to compete with Juul when they have 60, 70 percent of the market and our product isn’t even close to what they have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSsxnG"&gt;Once Howard Willard became the CEO of Altria, he was of a mindset different from his predecessor in that he thought they should consider doing a deal with Juul. Like, “Let’s try to buy Juul. Instead of competing, let’s just try to buy our biggest competitor and make them part of our brand portfolio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ4gyL"&gt;And that had been a strategy that Altria had used for years. In the smokeless market, when they couldn’t figure out how to make a brand that was competing with Copenhagen, they just went out and bought it. This was sort of an old playbook for the tobacco industry. And so they started thinking, “Well, let’s buy Juul.” They engaged in negotiations over a very long period of time, starting in 2017. And there was all this back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4tdP6"&gt;Altria initially wanted to just buy Juul outright. And Juul immediately was like, “We have no interest in selling outright. We want to retain control of the company.” And so there are all these negotiations going back and forth and they ultimately decided to invest $12.8 billion into Juul for a 35 percent share; at the time, the company was valued at $38 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Os3USQ"&gt;I should point out, this entire transaction, the Federal Trade Commission has sued... What happened was, Altria, weeks before the deal was announced in December of 2018, they just took MarkTen off the market, their Elite product. They told the FDA, “We’re so concerned about the youth usage issue, that we want to be a team player. We want to show you how responsible we are and how concerned we are for public health. We don’t want kids using these pod products. So we’re going to be responsible and we’re going to remove MarkTen from the market.” That’s what they told Scott Gottlieb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWJ5j3"&gt;Well, less than a month later, there was this announcement that Altria had purchased a 35 percent stake in the biggest pod product on the market, that had been seen as the biggest contributor to the youth usage issue. Scott Gottlieb was furious. The FDA felt like this was just entirely duplicitous and basically just said that they were playing the FDA like a fiddle.  Then months later, the FTC sued to unwind the deal between Altria and Juul. They alleged that it was anti-competitive because Altria took its MarkTen product off the market and colluded, in order to gain a larger market share. The trial is going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4azkAx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t it kind of make no sense, though?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsgc9J"&gt;It depends on the way you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYRV09"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a crap product. You know you’re not going to succeed. The nicotine salts are patented, you can’t go after them. You shut it down to buy the small company that makes a good product. That’s just Business 101. What is the actual collusion there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irLckc"&gt;The idea is that Altria could have competed in the market that they had intended to compete in, had there been another large player with deep pockets in the market like Altria, they could have fostered a more competitive market. They claim that there was a quid pro quo, that Altria took its MarkTen off the market in order to do the deal with Juul, and that was anti-competitive, that resulted in monopolistic behavior. Of course, Altria is arguing exactly what you’re saying right now. They are &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter"&gt;currently before the FTC&lt;/a&gt;. All of their executives are being interviewed, they’re testifying, and that’s exactly their argument, that this was a product that was so bad it had no future, it was the shittiest product on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYnCUn"&gt;I mean, it’s a hilarious argument for a big tobacco company to be making: “We were terrible at innovation. Our product was the worst and we sucked, and so we had to basically take the product off the market.” It’s a complicated issue. Like I said, the FTC will decide. The deal could be unwound and that would be something, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2hlHY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The structure of the deal is really strange. A lot of Juul employees just got huge amounts of cash and walked, which is not usually how these kinds of deals work. You get stock, you have a vesting period. There’s all this stuff that makes you stay after an acquisition, but it feels like a lot of Juul employees and investors got huge checks and bounced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqTe7"&gt;Yes, it was a highly unusual deal. The $12.8 billion that Altria paid for its stake was structured as a special dividend. What that meant was that none of the existing shareholders had to sell their stock. They just got a check for $12.8 billion. Some of that was distributed to employees, a billion dollars in bonuses paid out to employees depending on their tenure. Some of them got hundreds of thousands of dollars just as a special bonus. Others got more than $1 million. Of course, the largest beneficiaries of that deal were the board members and the founders. So the single largest shareholder at the time, Riaz Valani, made around $2.6 billion just like a windfall. Nick Pritzker, the Hyatt billionaire, he made $1.7 billion. Bowen and Monsees each got about $650 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3feQj"&gt;It was highly unusual. Oftentimes, when you bring in that type of investment and that type of capital, you’ll use it either to pay down debt or to go to your company’s operations. This was just a chunk of money that was just divided up among them and they got that. So almost none of it went back into the company. In fact, none of it went back into the company. So yeah, it was a sweet deal for Juul, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DKujz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like Juul had so much leverage because it had a product people liked better than cigarettes it was able to just extract, for itself, a cashout. They basically sold the problem to Altria.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ5lMW"&gt;That’s the most amazing thing about this deal. The fact that Altria paid that amount of money is just reckless, in my opinion. It’s like everybody knew the company was coming under this regulatory scrutiny, that they had this lung issue that they had been entangled in, that they had been fingered as the single largest contributor to the youth epidemic. I mean, there were so many risks in investing in this company, but it was almost a byproduct of just sheer momentum and desperation that ended up in this $12.8 billion payout. Altria basically had its back up against the wall. Juul had them over a barrel. They were so desperate to have this product that they could sell, that would actually give them a foothold in the e-cigarette market, that they paid this huge sum of money. I think it was a terrible deal. I think everybody agrees it was a terrible deal except for Bowen, Monsees, Pritzker, Valani. They made out pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ufn3YT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like a really strange moment for the FDA, for public health officials to be talking about regulating various health and tech companies. Obviously, we came through the pandemic, the FDA and public health were politicized. There’s a lot of lack of trust in institutions. Smoking rates rose during the pandemic, which is one of the odder effects of a respiratory illness, I think. What happens next? How does this all come together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7F6ul"&gt;It’s actually fascinating. The FDA is trying to carry out this long-term plan that began under Scott Gottlieb, but that had actually been talked about for decades. They call it the Tobacco Endgame. What that means is the FDA has decided that there’s a huge potential public health benefit in getting people off smoking cigarettes onto potentially less harmful products, like Juul. It’s so strange because the FDA had been going after Juul for so long and there’d been the whole explosion of the youth issue and how that just subsumed the agency. And now, as they talk about this plan that the FDA has — and it’s going to go through the regulatory process, it’s going to take years — but the plan is that they’re going to reduce nicotine in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXNyeP"&gt;The idea being that, again, if there’s no nicotine or minimally addictive amounts of nicotine in cigarettes, people aren’t going to use them, so they can essentially get rid of the cigarette. That’s the FDA’s strategy to get rid of smoking. As part of that strategy, if there’s a category of people that can’t get the nicotine from their cigarettes, but they still very much want it, the FDA would like to have a suite of products available to the public that will give them their nicotine fix without being as deadly as a cigarette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afl1pz"&gt;This has been an issue that Mitch Zeller, who is the head of the [FDA’s] Center for Tobacco Products, has been working on for decades. &lt;a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/22/suppl_1/i40.full.pdf"&gt;He’s written all kinds of articles&lt;/a&gt; and studies about it, literally dating back to the 1990s, and this whole idea of this harm reduction plan, that if you can just provide people with a less harmful alternative to cigarettes, then you could save a lot of lives. And it’s very much like what Adam and James talked about, the Juul co-founders, early on. If the FDA approves Juul or authorizes Juul to continue to be marketed, it could actually position Juul to be the product that smokers turn to, because they no longer have their nicotine in the cigarettes and they’re searching for something else. There are other products on the market that compete with Juul, but I think a lot of people agree that Juul remains the most popular and is one of the most effective nicotine delivery mechanisms out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMAREh"&gt;So it’s just fascinating to me that the FDA, in carrying forward with this nicotine reduction plan, could actually be setting up Juul for a resurgence, another life, act two, however you want to say that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peT059"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve noticed there’s a lot more nicotine replacement or nicotine delivery products in the market lately. Just at my local CVS, the shelf behind the counter of nicotine stuff has gotten bigger. There’s more flavors. There’s new kinds of lozenges. There’s more exciting kinds of gum. It seems like they’re becoming consumer products in a way that, I don’t know, Nicorette never thought of itself as a consumer product. Is that a shift that was precipitated by Juul? Or is that a new market opportunity created by the FDA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz2dEW"&gt;I think there’s this realization that this is a huge market. The market for nicotine products is $800 billion globally. I mean, it’s a massive market, and that includes lozenges, patches, all of that, including e-cigarettes. I think this gets back to what we were talking about, the socio-cultural question about nicotine use in America. I think businesses realize that this is a market that is not going away. Even if people aren’t getting nicotine from their cigarettes, they’re going to continue looking for nicotine in other places, whether it’s through Juul, whether it’s through a lozenge, whether it’s through a patch, I think that we’re going to be a nation of nicotine users and nicotine addicts. I don’t see that changing anytime soon and I think businesses have recognized that there’s an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQDVus"&gt;Certainly, the advent of Juul thrust that market forward with maybe greater velocity, seeing just how much money can be made and seeing how popular it is, that type of thing. But certainly, as the FDA moves forward in reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes, that market is only going to continue to grow. I think that the industry is transforming from the tobacco industry to the nicotine industry. And so I think we’re going to see a lot of innovation in the nicotine industry and there’s going to be more nicotine products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6ilV9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the FDA has changed its approach? I mean, we think about the FDA, at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as regulating health technology. Apple’s going to put another sensor on your watch. They’re going to make some claims about what it can do. The FDA should probably step in and verify those claims or prevent Apple from making those claims, or whatever it is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DGtQy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the flip side, there is the pandemic. It’s unavoidable that a bunch of public health mandates got deeply politicized and a lot of people in America are just like, “Don’t tell me what to do. I’m an adult, I’m going to take whatever risks I want to take, and that will be the end of it. Get out of my hair.” And those things seem like a collision course and the nexus of that collision is nicotine products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaSspP"&gt;This is one of the most politicized products in the world. You have the tobacco industry right now, as we speak, going to great lengths to try to influence the FDA to reeducate Americans about nicotine. Altria has told the FDA that they believe that some of the funding that they’ve been using on anti-vaping campaigns should also be used on teaching Americans that nicotine isn’t unhealthy. So the FDA is under huge pressure by the industry to go in this direction of harm reduction. And, of course, you have the anti-vaping people, the youth tobacco prevention people who want to see less of these products on the market because they continue to pose a threat to young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="795BQA"&gt;I think the FDA is in an impossible position. If they do not approve Juul, I think there’s going to be lawsuits all around. It would look terrible for the FDA to single-handedly put an American company out of business, which is what would happen if they don’t grant this regulatory authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSBxqU"&gt;And at the same time, they would be removing from the market the exact type of product that the FDA is in a way endorsing or facilitating, when they say that we’re going to take nicotine levels down and we want Americans to use a less harmful alternative. So it’s a very complicated, controversial issue that has so many different facets to it that there’s absolutely all kinds of political pressure and lobbying going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHj2A6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading your book, looking at the history of the research and how it’s politicized, it seems like the cigarette companies just created a lot of noise in the research. They paid for a lot of studies. They said, “We can never really know this stuff.” It feels like there are echoes of it now, where you can pick a study and it says what you want it to say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VcQBX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a strategy that Juul is using now? Is that a strategy you see other companies using? It seems like the tobacco wars, as you call them, became the focal point for what we can actually twist science to say whatever we want it to say, or at least create confusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J47le"&gt;The way that the tobacco industry just obfuscated and lied and covered up scientific research, and at the same time paid scientists to generate studies that would support their conclusion — One of the reporters back in the 1990s called it the largest misinformation campaign in American business history. There was an extraordinary amount of lying and deceit by these tobacco companies. And I do think that’s causing a huge challenge for Juul right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky9I0c"&gt;One, because anything they put out is going to be immediately doubted as just being another study that’s been bought and paid for by the tobacco industry. It’s making it very hard for the company to come up with any credible science that people are actually going to take hook, line, and sinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPLCev"&gt;There have been some issues recently where a public health journal that &lt;a href="https://www.juullabs.com/ajhb-monograph-publication-april-2021/"&gt;Juul essentially paid for published a series of studies&lt;/a&gt;. And there were all these disclaimers saying that these were people who worked at Juul, scientists at Juul, consultants who were hired by Juul. Literally the entire journal was articles written by people paid for or employed by Juul. And it caused a huge controversy in the public health community and among researchers and scientists who were saying, “Well, this is happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNvwEY"&gt;Now, Juul will say that these were legitimate studies that they did that deserve to be in this public health journal. But to me, what I found most fascinating is just the reaction to that, where immediately people jumped on that and said, “This is exactly like tobacco 2.0. They’re using the same tactics. They’re buying health journals and they’re engaging in those same types of tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pImEQ3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of the focus of the controversy and a lot of the focus in your book is that Juul’s marketing to teenagers, to influencers, to social media, created the crisis for itself, that they had an initial marketing plan and they hired a flashier marketing guy. And he was like, “We’re going all in.” New York City-cool, billboards with models, the whole deal. And that created the problem. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqRrn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I actually went to the Juul launch party that you describe in a warehouse full of influencers and beautiful people taking selfies. The whole thing, literally, it was full of Juul vape. It was an incredible party. And I walked out with a Juul, and I was immediately addicted to a Juul. It was great. I hope my mom doesn’t listen to this. I have since quit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw5Za7"&gt;Good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3WkbT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the problem that it was just too cool? It’s such a weird aspect of this controversy, that one of the things that set Juul on the path of destruction was that it was perceived as cool, which is what every business person wants their product to be perceived as. Is the heart of the problem that they hired the wrong marketing guy and they chased “cool” instead of, I don’t know, being perceived as medicine or a back brace or something that would just never be as cool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QDy8Z"&gt;Absolutely. I think that is and was their biggest misstep. I think had they treated the product with the requisite care that an addictive product should have, then they would have been better off. Instead, they hired a marketing staff whose sole focus was making this product as flashy and attractive as possible. They treated it as a gadget, as the next-generation iPhone, and that it was a fashion accessory. They gave it to models on runways at the New York fashion show, so literally it was a fashion accessory, and they treated it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgRF0m"&gt;And the way that the early ads had pictures of these young, beautiful people using the Juul, there was no mention of nicotine. There was no mention that this was an addictive product. It was just suddenly this cool thing that you had to have in your hip pocket or in your whatever, in your hand, if you wanted to be a trendsetter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twXuLu"&gt;I do believe that that was their original sin. However, it also launched their product in a huge way. I think Juul likes to distance themselves from the “&lt;a href="http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/images_pods.php?token2=fm_pods_st655.php&amp;amp;token1=fm_pods_img35520.php&amp;amp;theme_file=fm_pods_mt068.php&amp;amp;theme_name=JUUL&amp;amp;subtheme_name=Vaporized"&gt;Vaporized&lt;/a&gt;” campaign and say, “Oh, the Vaporized campaign didn’t really work. And it wasn’t until later that the product took off.” But there is no doubt that the Vaporized campaign gave it this original cachet and that launched it onto Times Square billboards, that launched it into magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZCPOA"&gt;And by the way, these were advertising tactics that the tobacco industry was literally banned from engaging in. They hired people who knew nothing about tobacco to do their marketing and who knew the most about how to make a brand pop, how to make a product be super desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTuymu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have struggled with this one forever. If you make a product that 40-year-olds think is cool, it is likely that 20-year-olds will think it’s cool. And the real win of the Juul was the nicotine salts. There were lots of vapes at that time. They all had different kinds of designs, and maybe they weren’t designed by Yves Behar or whoever, but the reason the Juul won was because the product was more effective at delivering nicotine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td8sVk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If an uglier product had been effective at delivering nicotine, it might well have won. And to me, I can’t unpack that in my brain. Yep, they did an Instagram campaign, but really at the end of the day, they made a product that was “good.” They made a product that was really good at delivering nicotine to people, and that’s the thing that made it successful, not a handful of billboards in Times Square.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncVc5U"&gt;I think certainly the design and form factor of their product made it successful in addition to the nicotine solution. But I think one thing that we haven’t really talked about is that not only did they use nicotine salts, but they had the highest amount of nicotine on the market. At the time, it was 5 percent nicotine. Well, it still is, but no other e-cigarette on the market had 5 percent. It was a huge amount of nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBpQu"&gt;So I think you can’t really separate them out. It’s like, could they have made an ugly device that was cloistered somehow or that was not marketed, m1 and just put in a little box behind a CVS counter that looked like some sort of inhaler and would have been more like a medical device? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6sQj5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was thinking about orthopedic shoes. Should they have made orthopedic shoes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdZJWi"&gt;I really do think that if they had been focused on the adult smoker market, that they should have and probably would have chosen a different marketing campaign. I think that is clear. So whether or not the marketing campaign is the reason for the catastrophe that followed with kids using it, I think it’s undeniable. Of course, if you’re going to show up at a rave and there’s going to be a Juul container pop-up store there, they were absolutely designing it to be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX8zBQ"&gt;I think that there was another way that they could have done it that would have involved less flashy marketing and that would have been tailored toward adult smokers, which they claimed that it was. So I do think that the marketing played a role in it, for sure. And now whether or not there was the intent there, I think that’s a pretty big remaining question that is going to be litigated in courtrooms across the country, is whether or not they intended to market to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoktyu"&gt;Maybe they just intended to create a great product, just like Steve Jobs. Or maybe they intended to just do the best that they could. And I think that Adam and James did, actually. I think they just surrounded themselves with the wrong people. I think they made an error in judgment when they brought on Richard Mumby, [the chief marketing officer at Juul] and when they brought on other people whose sole goal was to make the product cool. I think that that was the wrong marketing strategy for them, and I think it backfired on them in a huge way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHxlHL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Mumby is the marketing guy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Kygwn"&gt;Yes. He was ultimately the chief marketing officer at Juul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh3mJa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laid low by the wrong marketing guy, a cautionary tale for all of us. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gpjts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said that you approached this book as a business book. That’s what got you interested in the entire story. We’re talking a lot about making markets, understanding markets, and governments constraining markets. Let’s end with a broad question. What is the biggest business lesson that you’ve taken away as you’ve looked into what happened to Juul?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oop4mn"&gt;I think it’s pretty clear to me that the biggest business lesson is you need to know who your customers are and you need to be responsible. I mean, it almost sounds cliche, but you can’t go out of the gate like a bull in a china shop. You have to approach the market responsibly and anticipate regulatory questions if you want to have long-term viability. Now, certainly people would argue that that’s not the way to go. No Silicon Valley entrepreneur or investor would get behind a company that was moving slowly, that was asking the FDA for permission. But I think in this instance, especially when you’re selling a highly addictive product, there just needed to be a higher level of care given to that particular product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcjM7w"&gt;Juul was selling a highly addictive product and they treated it like an iPhone or a watch or some other gadget. I think that they should have recognized what they were selling instead of trying to make it be something that it isn’t. I mean, it’s both of those things, but I think that they should have had a higher level of care and I think that businesses probably could benefit from that. In the long run, I think that they realize that’s not the way that you grow fast. So I think that there’s a very big tension between those and I understand that, but I do think that Juul would have bought itself longevity had it not just crushed the market like it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxEdIc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren, thank you for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It is a great book and out now. Tell people where they can go find it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4d8wy"&gt;Thank you so much. It was great talking to you. You can buy my book anywhere books are sold. Your local bookstore would be the best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zOIgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Prime Day, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to its lowest price of $25. However, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $45, $5 off its regular list price.

The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now it’s available with the same $5 discount as the standard Dot at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was released in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. It’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $85&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now.

    <title>Nacon RIG Pro Compact review: compact with caveats</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a crowd for a mini Xbox controller, but this one doesn’t get everything right&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="o2oP8U"&gt;Accessory brand Nacon recently put out its $50 RIG Pro Compact wired controller for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; (and Xbox One) consoles and PC, and I was immediately drawn to it. It doesn’t try anything revolutionary, but I have a thing for controllers that drastically alter the shape of the console maker’s reference design. In this case, Nacon’s is a tinier, shorter take on Microsoft’s latest controller, but the analog sticks and triggers feel just as large — some of the buttons are actually larger. There’s less distance between where your thumbs lie on the sticks and where the triggers are, which should be a boon for people with small hands or those who just want to feel like everything is easily within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrglXo"&gt;It’s a good-looking little controller. But setting the form factor to the side momentarily, one of the main features of the Rig Pro Compact is that it has a 3.5mm audio port for headphones and that it unlocks access to the Dolby Atmos app on PC and Xbox once you plug it in. With it, you’ll get Dolby’s spatial audio advancements through wired headphones or headsets you connect to the Pro Compact. It’s a nice incentive if you’re looking for a wired controller, but I don’t consider this to be a must-have feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7a2SGm82U79FeuWs2p8FlOhwuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521465/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all-plastic controller has a slightly grippy texture on its underside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XkNfdG"&gt;Whether you should buy the Pro Compact depends mostly on the size of your hands. As I mentioned, it’s a shorter controller from top to bottom than Microsoft’s, so there’s less distance between the triggers and buttons. That change, while beneficial for many, has a few knock-on effects that might negatively impact your experience with it, as it did for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xqXIdD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10629929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cInoon"&gt;I have medium-sized hands and their small grips tuck comfortably into my palms, but the rear section of the controller’s housing for the triggers gets in the way of where I’d normally rest my index finger knuckles on Microsoft’s controller. This likely won’t be problematic if you’re someone who keeps both sets of pointer and middle fingers at the ready on shoulder buttons (though, I have yet to meet anyone who uses a controller like this). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K6unc"&gt;Another change that might be an issue for more people is the relocation of the view, menu, and share buttons. They’re much closer to vital controls on the Pro Compact than they are on Microsoft’s controller. This one’s more nitpicky than the last, but it leads to accidental presses during gameplay. The menu button is &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;close to the X, A, B, Y buttons that it looks and feels like it belongs in that cluster of inputs. On the topic of buttons, the tactility of each face button feels spot-on compared to Microsoft’s controller, though around the back the rear triggers feel like they have a shorter pull, which makes them less satisfying to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2wu910mmY5kfGJ-htNBFLcpoaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521467/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is within reach, for better or worse. I accidentally tapped the menu, view, and share buttons during gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nacon Pro Compact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q15YyYBl0008U5xhxEaY97skqkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521464/cfaulkner_20210511_4581_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I usually like to rest my middle fingers around the grips, but the rear trigger housing gets in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIHcBI"&gt;One of my favorite things about the Pro Compact is its companion app available for Xbox and PC that lets you tweak the sensitivity of both sticks (in addition to their respective dead zones). It also allows you to remap every button on the controller to your liking, change the actuation distance of the triggers, and toggle the directional pad between four-way inputs to eight-way for more control options. The vibration can be toggled on or off in the app, as well. Microsoft lets you adjust many of these settings with its own controllers, but not every third-party company goes through the effort of making their own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVSS1V"&gt;If most of the controllers on the market for Xbox or PC are too big for your hands, the Nacon Pro Compact is fairly easy to recommend giving a try at $50. It’s one less thing to connect wirelessly or manage battery levels for, and its 9.8-feet braided cord is lengthy and has a breakaway connector to let it safely detach if there’s force applied to the cable. That’s all great, but if you don’t have any issues using Microsoft’s own Xbox controller from an ergonomic standpoint, there isn’t much here that’ll make your time gaming more enjoyable. I fit into the latter group, and while I could enjoy casual gameplay with the Pro Compact, it’s tough to turn away from the more familiar, comfortable curves of Microsoft’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A second exploit has emerged in the sad WD My Book Live data deletion saga </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlZ8MU"&gt;It looks like there may have been more than one exploit used to cause the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549677/wd-my-book-live-data-deletion-unplug-lan-cable-threat-actor"&gt;mass deletion of data&lt;/a&gt; from WD My Book Live NASes last week, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When news broke that people were finding that their data was missing, some (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555959%2Fwd-my-book-live-second-exploit-authentication-factory-reset-without-password-root-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;including WD itself&lt;/a&gt;), pointed to a &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18472"&gt;known exploit from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed for root access of the device. However, it appears as though there’s more going on than was initially suspected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqfxjK"&gt;If you have one of these devices, you should unplug it from the internet before reading any further — it’s clear at this point that your data is at risk if the device is online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOZl9M"&gt;The second exploit, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t give an attacker full control over the device like the other exploit. It just allows them to remotely wipe the device without having to know the password. Tragically for those who lost data, it seems that code that would’ve prevented this &lt;a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/"&gt;was actually present&lt;/a&gt; in the WD My Book Live’s software, but it appears to have been commented out (or deactivated) by WD at some point — because of this change, the software didn’t run authentication when asked to do a factory reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9qV8X"&gt;WD had stopped supporting these devices in 2015. While the exploit has been around since at least then, it’s not necessarily a scenario where an obvious security issue persisted through years and years of updates. The question still remains, though, as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; hackers decided to factory reset the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlURsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; has a wild theory, based on &lt;a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/"&gt;analysis by security firm Censys&lt;/a&gt;: the data deletion happened as the result of a fight between hackers, with one botnet owner potentially trying to take over or disrupt another’s. One hacker (or group of hackers) was using the known exploit to control the devices for some nefarious purposes. Then, another entity used the unknown remote wipe exploit to erase those devices. It likely would’ve removed the first entity’s access to the hardware — but users’ data was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0zoEK"&gt;The theory does make sense, given the competing nature of the exploits used. (Why would a hacker burn a previously unreported exploit to factory reset the machines after already having root access?) For its part, WD told &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;that it could confirm that both exploits were used, at least in some cases. The company said it was “not clear why the attackers exploited both vulnerabilities,” but noted that it would update its security advisory about the second exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5GOXz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; didn’t immediately receive a response when it reached out to WD for comment on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
