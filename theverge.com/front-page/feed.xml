  &lt;p id="rNa2z5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s Streambar&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few double-duty soundbars out there that can also connect to your TV to stream TV shows and movies in 4K HDR from all sorts of services, like Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more. If that sounds appealing to you, this compact 14-inch soundbar is just $100 at a variety of retailers today, costing $30 less than usual. The Streambar has four full-range drivers, and on its back is an HDMI port, an optical audio port, and a USB port. This soundbar can be wall mounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WYMRX4"&gt;Acer’s excellent 13.5-inch 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 713 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s $429 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $629. My colleague Monica Chin rates the Spin 713 as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best Chromebook you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt; because of its 3:2 aspect ratio QHD display, a backlit keyboard that’s comfortable to type on, and a processor capable of handling a heavy load of tabs with no slowdown. We’ve occasionally seen it sell for $529, but this is a much better deal that seems to be exclusive to Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vi69Sq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxArUu"&gt;If you’re a Costco member, you can get a good deal on the Apple Watch SE. This model usually sells for $270, but members can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/apple-watch-se-40mm-gps.product.100457716.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm model with GPS connectivity for $240&lt;/a&gt;. This $30 price cut might not be worth getting a membership for on its own, but current Costco shoppers might want to check this deal out. You can also get $30 off the larger 44mm-sized SE, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/apple-watch-se-44mm-gps.product.100688310.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $270&lt;/a&gt; instead of $300 at Costco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UHrjmp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btajOn"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;miniseries from HBO is available on UHD Blu-ray disc with a collectible steelbook case &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741000996008832876#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy for $30&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual $45 price. These discs will work with standard Blu-ray players that aren’t capable of true 4K output, and it includes a digital copy of the show. This specific bundle is exclusive to Best Buy, and it costs a few dollars less than the standard version available at other retailers that doesn’t include such a hauntingly clever case design inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Scream&lt;/em&gt; by Edvard Munch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible with older phones that have a Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series chipset, it’s at the discretion of each OEM whether to add support. It seems more likely that companies will make the big effort to implement improved haptics in upcoming phones than adding it to older models. As for which newer models will feature the framework, none have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNU9eK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VTX comes with “no performance trade-offs,” says Lofelt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsR6Fl"&gt;Ahead of this announcement, I got to actually feel the difference myself that Lofelt’s improved haptics can make on a phone through software tweaks only. The company sent over a custom Google Pixel 4 packed with demos that show off how its vibrations feel compared to the stock Android implementation (the same setup can’t be duplicated on other devices). Compared to phones designed to take full advantage of Lofelt VTX’s integration with the chipset, this Pixel 4 was running the haptics tricks through the application layer as a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m54Hgt2LU3SXibxUiEMAat33Vzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522947/lofelttoggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lofelt’s app let me feel the difference between stock Android vibrations and the company’s own — and the difference was noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vih4G"&gt;Each of the demos featured a toggle that lets you switch between the stock Android vibration and Lofelt’s refined haptics, as shown in the bottom right of the picture above. One instance ran through a few scenarios in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrations varied in strength and duration depending on the kind of gun being shot, and I was able to feel distinct pulsations of a helicopter soaring through the sky. A demo for &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9: Legends&lt;/em&gt; let me feel the roar of an engine through haptics, as well as the fast, crunchy pulsing of the vibration motor when the car ran over a dirt median. Even though the Pixel 4 and earlier models don’t natively support VTX, these demos were far more expressive than standard Android phone vibrations. If you’re someone who takes mobile gaming seriously, to the point of owning something like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi controller&lt;/a&gt;, haptics could make your favorite games feel more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPUkDo"&gt;The big challenge for Lofelt isn’t in proving that these sorts of immersive haptic experiences are worth building (give the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lofelt-studio/id1482238306"&gt;Lofelt Studio app for iOS&lt;/a&gt; a try if you need convincing yourself). The real work is ensuring that as many phones as possible can eventually get them, and that it won’t take too much effort for developers. That’s where Lofelt’s AX (adaptive experience) signal processing tech built into VTX comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0AHjL"&gt;According to Lofelt, AX converts a universal haptic signal into vibrations that play to the strengths of each individual phone, taking into consideration its haptics driver, actuator hardware, and control algorithms from the manufacturer. The goal is for Android devices to catch up to Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine that’s in modern iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d67vsXP1TXxgnEht8c6zjiSlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955672/akrales_201012_4137_0103.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Older phones with the Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series can be updated as OEMs see fit, but you’ll likely find better haptics in new phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LNUdA2"&gt;App and game developers can design advanced haptics using Lofelt Studio, which integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Xcode, and create a universal .haptic file that works across multiple devices. According to Lofelt, these files contain “universal parameters, such as whether the haptics should include smooth, continuous signals or more punchy, dynamic events.” In other words, you’ll only need to build it once, then the framework can deliver a consistent experience across different phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERQJA"&gt;Existing games and apps running on supported Snapdragon hardware won’t be left in the dust. Lofelt claims that framework will also be able to convert the audio stream coming from an app into vibrations in real time without any hardware or coding modifications. So, you won’t necessarily need to wait for every developer to create bespoke haptics in order to start feeling some tactile enhancements with apps you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3gtcJ"&gt;Lofelt says that its VTX framework comes with no performance trade-offs, and that it aims to deliver better haptics “while minimizing the impact on battery and actuator.” That sounds great, and the demo I tried feels ready for deployment. But now, the wait begins for some phone manufacturers to kickstart what could be a big, positive change for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are uncomfortable with digital health tools used to control COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3GDGazX19HQe0rdDrH0m93t-Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310908/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Bb4sh"&gt;Most people in the United States don’t want their digital data used to control the spread of COVID-19, a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10918?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=051921"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found. More than half of the people in the study remained wary of sharing their data in different scenarios, including a smart thermometer company sharing information with public health officials, or using the Google and Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;exposure notification app&lt;/a&gt; to track infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgKd6k"&gt;“I was surprised a bit about the degree of skepticism when the potential benefits are so high,” says study author David Grande, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vaGiT"&gt;Grande and his team collected survey responses from 3,547 US adults during July 2020 about their attitudes toward the use of digital information to respond to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LeGJ"&gt;The survey asked whether or not they approved of using aggregated data pulled from social media to set health policies or contact people for COVID-19 testing. It asked whether they were okay with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data from smart thermometers being used for either health policies or contact tracing. It asked about three versions of the Google and Apple exposure notification app: one where using the app and any data sharing with health officials is optional; a second where using the app is optional but it automatically shares data with health officials; and a third where the app is mandatory. Finally, it asked whether people approved of the use of cellphone data to enforce quarantine and identify people at high risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4ymnU"&gt;The lowest support was for monitoring social media to set health policies — only 28 percent of people approved or strongly approved of that scenario. The highest level of support was for a version of the Google and Apple exposure notification app where use was optional but information was shared with health officials, of which 43 percent of people approved or strongly approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8m3uim"&gt;Grande thinks people may be more interested in the exposure notification app than official use of social media data because they get a more direct benefit, even though it’s a more invasive tool. “Some of the other uses, people may think, ‘I’m contributing my data for the common good but how is it going to protect me as an individual?’” he says. A tool that was developed to tell people if they’ve been exposed to a virus may seem worth the trade-offs around privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AWtTys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives. I thought that people would be more accepting” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Azr5PQ"&gt;Still, that program only had explicit support from less than half of the people surveyed, even though the survey went out just as the country was coming out of the first wave of COVID-19 and lockdowns. “Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives,” Grande says. “I thought that people would be more accepting.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxuQEM"&gt;Having personal experience with COVID-19, like a family member getting the disease, didn’t impact people’s approval of these tools, the study found. Neither did living in an area with high rates of COVID-19. People who were politically conservative, though, were less likely to support the use of digital data to manage COVID-19 than people who were liberal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CimmVB"&gt;In general, people tend to be worried when they start hearing about the collection and use of health data, Grande says. Their personal digital data might already be collected by companies and used for things like advertising, but it might not be as apparent — and they’re not asked direct questions about it. People also don’t realize that virtually all of the data collected by companies can be analyzed to infer things about health, like their mood or behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nJoW3"&gt;“I suspect that if we ask people direct questions about many commercial uses of their data that are currently taking place, we would see much greater resistance to those,” Grande says. “It’s just that many of those other uses aren’t so visible to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrzAC"&gt;The results of the study show that if they want people to use digital tools, public health officials will have to underscore the privacy protections that they have in place, and point out the direct benefits for users. A large chunk of people who responded to the survey said that they neither agreed nor disagreed with the use of data in the various scenarios — a sign that they could be persuaded. If most of that group backed something like the exposure notification app, officials would have close to two-thirds of people in support, Grande says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6D2ZT"&gt;“Through effective policies and communication, I think we can convince people that — assuming that protections are in place — these are a good idea,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpeqS7-xZs5K93r7a7GER8zE018=/0x0:895x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310906/Under_Embargo___Snapdragon_778G_Press_Note_Final_11__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different cameras at once. You can easily switch between different cameras’ video feeds during recording ala &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/control-your-shots-with-directors-view-on-galaxy-s21-series/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s director view&lt;/a&gt; on the Snapdragon 888-powered S21 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzGLZ"&gt;The processor also supports cameras with staggered HDR sensors like the 50-megapixel chip in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for better HDR video recording. The 778G also includes some improvements for more GPU-efficient mobile gaming, and things like better noise suppression and camera experiences on video calls. Both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G are supported, as well as Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PGoBr"&gt;In “more 5G in more places” news, Qualcomm is also making M.2 reference designs available for current OEM customers of its X65 and X62 5G modems. This makes it easier for laptop, desktop, gaming, and IoT manufacturers to incorporate 5G connectivity into their products. The company is also debuting a new X65 5G modem, which Qualcomm says is more energy efficient and offers wider support of mmWave frequencies. It will start appearing in commercial mobile devices later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify enters the virtual concert business, starts selling $15 tickets to events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jDAwIgkefm7JvFJkkJxkqe0VPY=/0x0:1227x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310892/spotifylivestream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify is hosting virtual, prerecorded concerts starting in May.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQywgq"&gt;Spotify is entering the virtual concert business, just as in-person concerts are becoming more of a possibility. The company &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can now buy tickets to five different concert streams, which will air throughout May and June. Initial artists include The Black Keys, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Leon Bridges. The streams all are prerecorded but can only be viewed at a given time through the web browser. The shows aren’t available on demand, and they aren’t accessible through the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79LZSv"&gt;Tickets cost $15, and viewers must have a Spotify account to watch the show. (Viewers can set up a free Spotify account during the ticket-buying process if they don’t already have one.) You can check out the &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/faq"&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; for more details, but notably, tickets are tied to individual users’ accounts, so they’re non-transferable, and if you end up missing the show, you can’t get a refund. (Spotify says each artist’s recording will air at four different times to account for the world’s various timezones, so buyers have to select their preferred time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS7CL"&gt;Spotify previously participated in the concert ecosystem by allowing artists to list shows through its app and link out to ones from specific partners, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15810710/spotify-eventbrite-integration-concert-recommendations"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, the company said it &lt;a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-generated-40m-in-ticket-sales-last-year-now-its-accelerating-its-presence-in-live-music/"&gt;generated more than&lt;/a&gt; $40 million in ticket sales through its Fans First program, which gives fans extra perks, like early access to tickets. It also hosted its own in-person events tied to its playlist branding, including Rap Caviar and Viva Latino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fAodK"&gt;During the pandemic, the company started listing virtual concerts, too. Fifteen dollars for these prerecorded concerts feels a bit steep, especially because it isn’t much different than live sets you can likely find from late-night shows or other specials for free on YouTube or Instagram Live, but it seems like Spotify is trying to find a new revenue stream and way to keep fans engaged during a time when most have been disconnected from the idea of live music. It’s unclear if the company intends to keep up the virtual concert series. For now, these five shows are all the commitment we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyTbmr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China releases first images from its Zhurong rover on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcYr2EHpT8Ept2uc7VEHMrSE5UA=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310749/E1wEz5VWYAINTeA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqRu1w"&gt;China’s Zhurong rover has beamed back its first images from the surface of Mars after landing on a vast plain called Utopia Planitia. The rover plunged through the Martian atmosphere last Friday, bundled together with a lander after separating from China’s Tianwen-1 probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hHHok"&gt;The new images released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) show the two robots meticulously executing their first post-landing steps: the lander extended a tiny ramp to help Zhurong put its six wheels on the Martian surface for the first time. And Zhurong unfolded its four wing-like solar panels and a communications antenna, as seen from one of the rover’s navigation cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyrxLqkuPlBnWb7lJHpHEBG4ENk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525317/E1wE0EBXEAU0sI5.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A shot of the backside of Zhurong taken by a navigation camera, showing the rover’s antenna and solar panels deployed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBnnoq"&gt;The Tianwen-1 mission, which arrived in Martian orbit in February, is China’s first trek to Mars. Until last week, only the US had been able to successfully land and operate rovers on the Red Planet. NASA’s most recent rover, Perseverance, landed in February at Jezero Crater, a little over a thousand miles from China’s landing site at Utopia Planitia. (NASA’s Viking-2 mission also landed at Utopia Planitia in 1976.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQcB2f"&gt;Surviving the dive through Mars’ atmosphere — the “seven minutes of terror” — is the hardest part of any voyage to the planet. CNSA also released images of the landing phase in action: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a_gB7GNu8HGezjTBMrIgD7RCQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525334/landing.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CNSA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RcrtJh"&gt;Tianwen-1 launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in China’s Hainan province on July 23rd last year, setting off on its seven-month trek to the Red Planet. Now, with Zhurong preparing to rove Utopia Planitia, China has its first robotic laboratory on Mars. The rover’s instruments will work to study the planet’s geology and climate during its planned 90-day mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks court to rule iOS is not an ‘essential facility’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lj2NFTGo5oCxlnN603zOw__94tU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310699/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfvrvd"&gt;After two and a half weeks in court, Apple is taking aim at one of the central elements of Epic’s antitrust case. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20761616-apple-motion-to-dismiss-essential-facility-claim"&gt;In a filing Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;, Apple asked the court to dismiss one of the 10 counts alleged in the initial complaint, arguing Epic had failed to establish any evidence for the charge that Apple had violated the essential facilities doctrine by failing to provide access to software distribution tools on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cptEsS"&gt;“At trial, Epic adduced no proof in support of this claim,” Apple’s filing reads. “On the contrary, Epic’s principal expert expressly disclaimed any opinion on essential facility, and (in response to a direct question from the Court) rejected the notion that iOS should be treated as a public utility. The Court should enter judgment for Apple on this claim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ccReMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform,’” says the judge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A1oReY"&gt;Filed as a motion for partial findings, Apple is pushing to split off the essential facilities charge from the other nine charges made in Epic’s initial complaint. In essence, Apple believes it can win a quick victory on this specific point. That won’t settle the case entirely since the other nine charges still require a ruling, but it would be an unexpected and embarrassing loss for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6KoVn"&gt;Epic hasn’t talked about the essential facilities doctrine much in court, and Apple’s lawyers are responding in part to vocal skepticism from the court. On May 12th, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers specifically confronted Epic about the weakness of its evidence for the charge. “I’ve heard quite a bit of evidence throughout the trial regarding how big Apple is and how anticompetitive it is,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1392558985643970564"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers said&lt;/a&gt;. “It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform. And there are only two of these platforms, and because there are only two platforms, all these competitors can’t succeed without access to these platforms.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdqrB"&gt;Epic’s counsel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392558958972391424"&gt;clarified that&lt;/a&gt; it had “not abandoned that theory” — but it hasn’t substantially raised it in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WYHR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” argues Epic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qpA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_facilities_doctrine"&gt;The essential facilities doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is a long-standing element of antitrust law that prevents dominant firms from using bottleneck services to box out competitors. &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/224/383/"&gt;In a foundational example from 1912&lt;/a&gt;, a railroad consortium prevented competitors from offering passage to and from St. Louis by denying access to switching yards around the city. The Supreme Court ruled that the arrangement was an illegal restraint of trade, establishing that companies must provide reasonable use of facilities that are essential for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnUoX"&gt;In its complaint, Epic argues that app distribution on iOS is the same kind of bottleneck, charging that Apple has used its control over the iOS platform to prevent Epic and other competitors from offering competing app stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQU0Z"&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” the complaint argues. “Through its denial of its essential facility, Apple maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKEwJA"&gt;But Apple is now countering that Epic has reasonable access to iOS through the App Store itself — and that iOS customers are plainly not essential to the operation of its business since the company has been broadly successful without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QIGvj"&gt;“Epic’s own experience, as established by the trial evidence, confirms that there is nothing ‘essential’ about iOS,” Apple’s filing reads. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was a success before it was made available on the App Store, and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s revenues from iOS (prior to its removal) accounted for just 7 percent of its total revenue. And native apps are not the only way Epic can reach iOS customers—it also is free to distribute its products (including by selling V-Bucks) to iOS customers over the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbx0cb"&gt;Apple’s motion asks for a hearing on the issue on Monday, May 24th — or “as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest returns June 10th with a ‘world premiere showcase’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VniRdNqzfc_uWS6LUYy-HyTc7rE=/0x0:4095x2730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310561/1193629349.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xLwq0h"&gt;Summer Game Fest is back this year, and it will start on June 10th with an event called “Kick Off Live!” that’s billed as a “spectacular world premiere showcase” with “more than a dozen” world premieres and announcements. The show, which will begin at 2PM ET, will be hosted by Geoff Keighley, who you might also know as the host of The Game Awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgGjP4"&gt;Kick Off Live! is just the first of many events that will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363385/summer-game-fest-returns-back-june-geoff-keighley"&gt;part of Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the publishers confirmed to be participating in Summer Game Fest include 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Microsoft Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emhlfe"&gt;This first event will also feature a performance by Weezer, “who will debut a brand new, stream safe game soundtrack song that can be freely streamed on Twitch, YouTube and anywhere else without being blocked or losing monetization,” according to a press release. (So it seems like we won’t see a repeat of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1362901765029527553"&gt;what happened with Metallica’s performance at BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiKfSo"&gt;Summer Game Fest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; to let publishers showcase their upcoming games after some of the industry’s biggest events were restricted or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many gaming events have been affected by the pandemic this year as well, forcing some, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"&gt;GDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt;, to shift to digital formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="O82Sgq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how E3’s all-virtual event will work this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433781/e3-2021-virtual-event-free-public-app-online-portal-livestreams"},{"title":"The 2021 Game Developers Conference won’t have in-person gatherings after all","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Official NBA jerseys are coming to Fortnite this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVHSPce7FyQoXxdHsDTFSQpvA2Q=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310537/NBA_partnership_announcement_image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fepGFp"&gt;Soon you’ll be able to fight to the death in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; while representing your favorite NBA team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79fNwK"&gt;Today, Epic revealed the latest collaboration for its battle royale game, which includes new purchasable characters that can don the jerseys of all 30 NBA clubs. They’ll be available in the in-game shop starting May 21st, along with basketball-related emotes and tiny basketball net backpacks. As part of the crossover, two NBA stars — Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young — have also hand-picked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lockers that players can purchase starting next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxB9GC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10507966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbvvtm"&gt;This is just the latest in Epic’s push to bring the world of sports into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In 2018, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064380/fortnite-nfl-skins-football"&gt;a collaboration with the NFL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;this year nearly two dozen soccer clubs were featured in the game&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;a virtual version of Brazilian superstar Neymar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6BeLV"&gt;The NBA crossover shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, given that some details — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417523/fortnite-party-royale-lebron-james-zion-the-rock-epic-apple"&gt;including reference to an arcade-style &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; basketball game&lt;/a&gt;, and an event featuring LeBron James — came out as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Apple vs. Epic&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;. Some of that may still be on the way. Epic says that next week there will be NBA-related news for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s creative mode, with details on May 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wujata"&gt;In the meantime, you can finally fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357140/fortnite-primal-update-egg-hatch-dinosaur-raptor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; raptors&lt;/a&gt; while wearing a Toronto Raptors jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Deathloop’s death loops work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcQzHtLrWpivSCqGZzFuOrg1AcM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310572/DEATHLOOP_MAY_01_8637260941513cc78b5.14268356.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An early look at the next game from Dishonored developer Arkane Studios&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mAiZJv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is a game about, well, death loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TejyDB"&gt;The next release from &lt;em&gt;Dishonored &lt;/em&gt;developer Arkane Studios, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the role of a man named Colt who wakes up in a strange-yet-stylish 1960s-inspired place called Blackreef. Like the studio’s past work, the game is a first-person action / adventure where players can use different weapons and supernatural skills in order to tackle problems — which usually involve murder — in different ways. But there’s a twist when Colt discovers he’s stuck in a time loop. As soon as he dies, he goes right back to the start of the same day. In order to break that cycle, he’s told, Colt must kill eight characters called “visionaries” before the day is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfFez3"&gt;It’s an interesting premise, but also one that raises a few questions. Namely: how do the loops actually work in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhqrSk"&gt;Dinga Bakaba, the game director on &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, provided some insight during a recent hands-off demo. The main thing, it seems, is that this is a game all about player freedom. Early on, players will be guided through the world and story — there are even on-screen prompts representing Colt’s memories, which serve as a tutorial of sorts — but eventually, things open up. Players will explore four different districts, and there are also different time periods that change what’s going on; one area might be very different in the morning versus the evening, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Deathloop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5AZjv5dhjDKdw5947ymwjAODBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523466/Deathloop_Map_of_Blackreef_863726099713bed9a51.13118819.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1FTIWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re very free with your progression.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaWkAl"&gt;“Now you have this moment where you can choose between the four districts,” Bakaba says of when the game opens up. “And then you go into a district, you do something and you get out, and then time moves to the next period. At this moment, so that you’re not lost, you end this opening section with a pair of leads, like an investigation. All of these leads have steps; it could be something like go to Aleksis’ space and go through her stuff to know more about Egor, or something like that. Those are your goals. That’s how you progress. You can also do those steps in the order that you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LV3CB5"&gt;He adds that “You’re very free with your progression. It’s not a game where a day is something that you do from beginning to end, and when you die, you have to restart the whole game over and over. That’s definitely not the case here. It’s about what you are doing in the world that keeps resetting itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKHAHn"&gt;This also means that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has a unique approach to time. Once you’re in a district, there’s no time limit. You can spend as much or as little time there as you need inside of it. But as soon as you exit to go somewhere else, time will move forward. Here’s how Bakaba explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3TCWEt"&gt;When you start the day, you start the day in the morning, and you can choose where you want to go. When you’re inside the district, you can take however long you want, and it’s when you exit that we move from the morning period to the noon period. And same thing, you can choose where you go. Basically time advances each time you exit one area. If you die and you’re out of rewinds, you’ll go back to the beginning of the day. And you can choose to skip a time period to go directly where you need to be, or where you want to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K9yzjg"&gt;This might make &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; sound a bit like a roguelike, a genre most recently popularized by games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where players explore procedurally generated worlds but have to restart once they die. (Bakaba notes that “&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is a really great game, I’m having a blast with it.”) Arkane even has some experience with the genre through &lt;em&gt;Mooncrash&lt;/em&gt;, a roguelike expansion for &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;. But Bakaba believes that there are some fundamental differences that make &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; different from more traditional roguelikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNWSJQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10506789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ViSCPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not about difficulty. It’s about having this feeling of mastery.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkzBjG"&gt;“My belief as a designer is that it’s not [a roguelike],” he explains. “There are a number of reasons for that. First of all, I think a good roguelike is about overcoming challenge, it’s going through these areas that are familiar but not the same. So you go through the first biome, and then you get to the next biome that’s even more difficult, and then you get to the ending and you’re super happy because that was super, super hard to get there, and you had to be both very skilled and lucky to get there. Which feels really nice, and lends itself to replaying. &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; is probably my favorite roguelike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcg2hm"&gt;“But here with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; it’s a bit different because getting to the end of the day isn’t an objective at all. It’s not even a milestone for the player. So there is no increasing difficulty, and there is no repetition. It’s weird to say that about a time loop, but there’s no forced repetition in the sense that if you don’t want to do the morning section, you can just jump to the night. It’s your choice. You’re really free to use the space and use the time to your liking... You get to this point where you’re basically a superhero in this world. At this point it’s not about difficulty. It’s about having this feeling of mastery, which for us is very important in this time loop fiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zzXduo"&gt;It all sounds very cool, but it’ll be some time before we get to experience those loops (and deaths) for ourselves. &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is slated to launch on September 14th on PC and the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
