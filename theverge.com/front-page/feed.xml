    <title>Huawei’s next folding phone is coming on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkhnGnxiwkQIkLnmrqkWocgmnoU=/0x0:690x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761147/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KEqkw4"&gt;Huawei will announce a new flagship foldable phone later this month, according to a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K0bsQcYma"&gt;Weibo post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s official page. Based on the name, the Mate X2 sounds like it should be a more substantial followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;original Mate X&lt;/a&gt; than Huawei’s last foldable phone, the faster and slightly tweaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lFCft"&gt;Unless Huawei is being deliberately cryptic, the teaser image for the Mate X2 actually suggests that the phone could possibly switch to a different folding screen design with the flexible panel on the inside, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Mate X phones had a single panel that wrapped around the outside when closed, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole’s Flexpai devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzTHsP"&gt;Otherwise, there’s not much in the way of details on the Mate X2 yet. It’s likely that it’ll have the same Kirin 9000 processor found in the Mate 40 Pro, and of course Huawei probably still won’t be able to include Google apps and services on board, limiting the device’s viability outside of China unless something changes unexpectedly quickly with the new Biden administration’s approach to sanctions. Huawei’s hardware is always worth paying attention to, though, so stay tuned for more news and details on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This hypercar is China’s first Belt and Road electric vehicle project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGjN1FpR9y9fq633G-tmexhqCig=/0x61:2047x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761011/473ADF4A_12AD_49FD_A400_E6F67E8D930A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Silk EV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QaDl3Y"&gt;A new engineering and design startup called Silk EV headquartered in Italy’s venerable Motor Valley is more than just another attempt at making an electric hypercar. It’s also the latest arrow in the quiver for China’s massive Belt and Road project, though the first that deals with electric cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN9aT0"&gt;Silk EV announced on Tuesday that it will co-develop an “ultra-luxury hypercar” called the S9 in the home region of Lamborghini and Ferrari with First Automobile Works (FAW), China’s original state-owned automaker. The S9 will be part of the Chinese automaker’s longstanding Hongqi brand, which means “red flag” and was once exclusively made for high-ranking Chinese government officials before becoming more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgOVz7"&gt;The two companies didn’t release any specifications about the S9, or any photos, save for a teaser image. In a press release, Silk EV said the vehicles it makes with FAW will “combine a dynamic, sustainable, and exclusive driving experience with the use of cutting-edge technology and innovation, delivering to China and the world the next-generation of luxury new energy vehicles.” One of the few things announced Tuesday is that the car is being designed by Walter de Silva, who has styled vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Audi, and Lamborghini, and headed up design for the Volkswagen Group in the late 2000s and early 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxAZET"&gt;China’s Belt and Road initiative is a massive effort to spin up infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe, and Africa that, in total, roughly trace the old Silk Road. The projects span dozens of countries and vary in size and scope. There are massive railways, hydropower plants, dams, and bridges. And in some places, like Djibouti, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11304.pdf"&gt;China is attempting to do nearly all of the above&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JowODN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Belt and Road has, until now, been more about infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysxqGA"&gt;While the Chinese government frames the Belt and Road initiative as one &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OubM8bD9kck"&gt;ripe with diplomatic and economic opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, the country has been accused of saddling some of its smaller partners with debt, leaving them susceptible to Beijing’s influence. Other projects have been criticized for favoring, or even requiring, the use of Chinese construction companies during &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative"&gt;unusually opaque bidding processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu9Pap"&gt;The best of China’s many EV startups have long aimed to expand outside the country, though only one — XPeng — has followed through on that promise &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;after beginning deliveries to Europe in December&lt;/a&gt;. Larger, more established automakers have kept their focus on exploiting the vast opportunity for consumer electric vehicles inside China, especially after the government began favoring clean energy vehicles a few years ago. (Commercial vehicles are a different story; major automaker BYD, for instance, sells electric buses in the US.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd8zvF"&gt;With electric vehicle technology maturing, and China controlling the bulk of the supply chain, an outward expansion from an established player only makes sense. And FAW is an unsurprising partner for Silk EV. Not only is the company’s Honqi brand recognizable throughout China, but FAW has shown an interest in electric vehicles, having helped kickstart EV startup Byton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W5O7c"&gt;Byton once had its own global ambitions. But it ran into financial trouble last year and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;now retreating from the US&lt;/a&gt; and reportedly being rolled up into FAW. (Former CEO of Byton Carsten Breitfeld, who now helms Faraday Future, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875328/byton-carsten-breitfeld-first-auto-works-chinese-government"&gt;accused the Chinese government of exerting influence on the startup through FAW in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HApV4u"&gt;While Italy makes sense as a target market to make and sell a hypercar, it’s also a logical political partner for a project like this, as it was the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-china-president-idUSKCN1R40DV"&gt;first G7 nation to endorse the Belt and Road initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epV2j"&gt;Xu Liuping, the chairman and party secretary of FAW, said in a press release that the joint venture with Silk EV “marks a major milestone under the Belt and Road initiative for China, Italy and the global automotive industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPUoWn"&gt;“It is a unique opportunity for FAW to build on its legacy of carmaking excellence in Jilin province — the center of China’s automotive industry — and for FAW Group to come together with Italy’s Motor Valley — renowned for its luxury and racing automotive heritage, integrated ecosystem, and world-class engineering — to become the new benchmark in new energy vehicles,” Xu said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Cyberpunk 2077 security exploit makes installing mods risky business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3YvDPiRl_8CpmUj2bTUEkT02yU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760452/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiPRVQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red has warned players that installing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; mods or custom save files on the PC could pose a security risk (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the company’s tweet, there’s apparently a “vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs.” The game’s official mod tools were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252373/cyberpunk-2077-official-mod-support"&gt;just released last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcAmqN"&gt;The company warns users not to install files from unknown sources, though &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that pretty much rules out all mods unless you can read and understand their code. When you’re dealing with a vulnerability that could potentially lead to arbitrary code running on your computer, it’s probably best not to risk it until a fix is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="slw3Z0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you plan to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CyberpunkGame&lt;/a&gt; mods/custom saves on PC, use caution. We've been made aware of a vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs. Issue will be fixed ASAP. For now, please refrain from using files from unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED CS (@CDPRED_Support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPRED_Support/status/1356604047671898112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5n7rV"&gt;This isn’t the first problem CD Projekt Red has faced with the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; mod system — the company also had to ask players to stop installing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253112/cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves-sex-mod-ban"&gt;mods that allowed them to have sex with Keanu Reeves’s character.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GameStop stock roller coaster has come to the dip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jw82xSwkSVKVbtxGqKKUfAJ689k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760120/slack_imgs.com.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbFmvo"&gt;It hasn’t been a good day for WallStreetBets, as GameStop’s stock has plummeted today. AMC, the community’s other bet, dropped as well. But unlike previous dips, the stocks don’t appear to be rallying. Prices stayed low for the entire trading day, something that hasn’t happened since WallStreetBets became a household name one week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIMZV"&gt;When the market closed today, the price of GameStop was $90 even, an 81 percent drop from GameStop’s peak at $483, and a 58 percent drop from its price of $218 on Friday evening. AMC is down too, closing today at $7.82, which is a 61 percent drop from its peak at $19.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDB84w"&gt;It’s hard to believe that in August of last year, GameStop was trading at $4.50. Between then and last week, some investors bet that the stock was undervalued, driving it up to around $30 a share. Then, the WallStreetBets subreddit decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;it would take the stock to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, punishing those betting against it and attempting to make money in the process. The idea of buying at $4 a share and selling for $400 obviously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;captured the public’s imagination&lt;/a&gt;, and millions rushed to give trading a try as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;the GameStop meme&lt;/a&gt; went mainstream — taking AMC and others along for the ride as investors realized they could pump those stocks too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graph of GameStop’s stock price over the past week." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7KU23LfjouhdsxlIZEjyVmHlQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277376/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.57.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s stock over the past week, with a big ‘ol dip today. If this was a roller coaster track, it’d be a lot of fun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A graph of AMC’s stock price over the past week" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRv75OA9UEH9RShZWeVscrNyOXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277377/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.57.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it’s not the same picture, just the same shape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T82PDq"&gt;As to whether this is the end of GameStop’s wild ride, it’s almost impossible to tell. The past week’s peaks, dips, and drops have been detached from the underlying businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfZbAJ"&gt;Part of that is the culture of WallStreetBets itself. Praising people for not selling their stocks, and ridiculing those that do is a recipe for a community that’s going to be stubborn. And now it’s started telling itself that the drop is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/"&gt;due to hedge fund market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owGj8F"&gt;If this news has made you feel like reading about other stock market shenanigans, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; has an article &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html"&gt;that compares what’s happening now to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze&lt;/a&gt;, and Vox’s &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22262271/gamestop-bubble-robinhood-henry-blodget-interview"&gt;has an interview with Henry Blodget&lt;/a&gt;, who was involved with the Dotcom bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWQ7E"&gt;As for the people who have deep losses from today’s dive? They’re hoping for a rally, so they can at least sell for what they bought in for. Some, like Dutch student Evan Oosterink, are counting on it — he bet about $10,000, which represented “years of savings from his parents and some government college loans,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/gamestop-stock-plunge-losers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt; He lost about $9,000 today, but is still holding the stock in the hope that he can recoup his loss. “Being a part of WallStreetBets, it’s like a religion you’re devoted to,” he said to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VfUu0E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was lovely reading those stories on Reddit about how GameStop stock changed their lives and will help them pay medical bills, save pets etc and I really, really, really hope they sold &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kcjwf4NNnN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kcjwf4NNnN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1356615785280602119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next macOS Big Sur update should make iPad apps look less awkward on the Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eiVcuQ_-cPPj7W5HLErWfl5YFQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760005/akramer_201113_4290_0023.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEfu9W"&gt;Apple just yesterday released its latest update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; with improved Bluetooth reliability and a handful of bug fixes. And today, it’s rolling out the first beta of macOS Big Sur 11.3, which will bring further refinements to Safari, Reminders, Apple Music, Apple News, and other apps. This update will also try to improve the experience of running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs, which can still be a little awkward at this early stage (and without a touchscreen display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxHDgd"&gt;iPadOS apps will now appear larger than before — if your screen size allows for it — and beta testers will find a new preference pane for iPhone and iPad apps that’ll let them better personalize the “touch alternatives” keyboard commands. Touch alternatives allow for “keyboard alternatives for tap, swipe, and drag gestures, and enables multi-finger gestures using the option key and a trackpad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c8j3Kj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TPnC0Y"&gt;Big Sur 11.3 will make Safari’s start page more customizable, letting you rearrange the different sections (favorites, Reading List, Siri suggestions, etc.) to your own liking. Developers will gain the ability to make extensions that run on the new tab page, and they can also take advantage of a new web speech API to integrate speech recognition on their web pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASHWiF"&gt;As for the Reminders app, you’ll be able to sort your reminders based on title, due date, priority, or creation date. And with this update, Apple will let you easily &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; your reminders if a paper copy might prove helpful when running to the store or completing other tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3YSYK"&gt;Apple Music gets small tweaks like a shortcut to your “Made for You” personalized playlists and mixes. Live and upcoming special events will be highlighted in the For You tab, as well. The Apple News app is undergoing some design improvements in the Apple News Plus tab to make your magazines and newspapers easier to reach (and download). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMd199"&gt;And like the upcoming iOS 14.5 update, macOS Big Sur 11.3 adds support for the latest Xbox and PlayStation DualSense controllers; the same compatibility is coming to Apple’s mobile devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;as part of iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another SpaceX Starship nails clean test flight, but explodes on landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8npTmWOZcXIP4itqoW_RehdKC4=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759903/spaceship_crash_space_x.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NofPJn"&gt;SpaceX’s latest Starship prototype launched on Tuesday, soaring miles above its South Texas facilities in a successful flight demonstration before exploding during the landing attempt. It’s the second failed landing in a row, after a previous prototype, SN8, launched and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;failed to stick the landing in December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5wSAQ"&gt;This week’s launch demo — one of many in the books already — follows weeks of tension between SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration, which approves test launches like this one. During its high-altitude test launch with SN8 two months ago, the company violated its FAA launch license. This triggered an investigation that held up today’s SN9 flight and frustrated SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a7ctV8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX launched the thing anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UKOxg"&gt;In a statement Tuesday morning announcing SN9 was clear to fly, the FAA confirmed the previous violation: Before SN8 launched, the agency had denied a request from SpaceX to waive public safety limits associated with the flight, but SpaceX launched the thing anyway. It’s still unclear what safety limits SpaceX wanted to waive in connection with the launch. The FAA declined to specify and SpaceX has yet to respond for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeUvD1"&gt;On Tuesday, with fresh FAA approval for a flight plan that “complies with all safety and related federal regulations,” the 16-story-tall rocket lifted off from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas test facilities around 3:30PM ET under clear skies, reaching an altitude of 6.2 miles (10km) — a bit shorter than SN8’s target altitude of 7.7 miles. After that, SN9 shut down its three engines to begin a free-falling dance back to Earth, tilting on its side to test new aerodynamic flaps and attempt a “belly flop” maneuver. If all had gone well, the rocket would have landed vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lto3dKdhzczNI3XoXx12q_ZheY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277204/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.31.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SN9 just before it’s untimely end.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Otrm3I"&gt;Instead, SN9 slammed into the ground at a roughly 45-degree angle, perishing in an explosive fireball just like SN8. “We had another great flight up to the 10km apogee... we’ve just gotta work on that landing a little bit,” said SpaceX engineer John Insprucker, who usually only narrates the company’s live video feeds for routine Falcon 9 launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwpek7"&gt;The FAA opened an investigation into the SN9 landing explosion, it said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that “although this was an uncrewed test flight, the investigation will identify the root cause of today’s mishap and possible opportunities to further enhance safety as the program develops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vv6h8"&gt;The landing explosion sprayed debris on SN10, another Starship prototype that stood ready for SpaceX’s next test flight. The company wheeled SN10 out of its towering, rocket-shaped facilities last Friday night to make room for future prototype construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAqbfO"&gt;On the live stream, Insprucker reminded SpaceX’s audience that the SN9 flight, though it ended in a dramatic explosion, was a test, and a number of test objectives were met. It was the “second time we’ve flown Starship in this configuration, we’ve got a lot of good data, and the primary objective to demonstrate control of the vehicle in the subsonic re-entry looked to be very good. And we will take a lot out of that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iCloud for Windows version that let you sync Apple passwords is no longer available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENAPCS-OGtplT01iFYBniRzXrSI=/0x191:1646x1288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759891/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_2.06.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aRJcj0"&gt;Apple’s rocky rollout of iCloud password sync on Windows has hit another bump: you can no longer download the version of the app that allowed syncing passwords from your Apple devices with your Chrome web browser on a Windows PC (&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-pulls-update-supports-icloud-keychain-windows-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmexperts+%28Windows+Central%29"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Version 12 of Apple’s iCloud for Windows app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;released last week with supposed support for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, but the Chrome extension to make it work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;wasn’t available until two days ago&lt;/a&gt;. Now, version 12 is gone from the Windows Store, with version 11.6 taking its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zfrDY"&gt;Weirdly, the changelog on the Windows Store still says that the password syncing functionality is present. However, upon downloading, the app shows the version as 11.6 in the top right. We verified this for ourselves, and you can see there’s no password sync option in our first screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7oNrUboWdOSOEC6x_1IIm2O0NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277292/icloud_11_6_windows_store.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The version of the app we downloaded today, 11.6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_KytxKImNL0D4_h7hiRU8q4Gms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263753/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Version 12 of the app with the passwords option, downloaded January 27.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YwPEQX"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/apple-pulls-icloud-12-icloud-passwords-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the late-to-the-party Chrome Extension is still available on the Chrome Web Store, at least for now. Anyone still on version 11 of the iCloud for Windows app, though, won’t be able to upgrade and take advantage of the extension anyhow. But if you currently have version 12 on your computer, Windows won’t make you downgrade to the previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ4mX"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple pulled the update — the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj/"&gt;reviews for the Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; aren’t good, but many of them are users reporting that it doesn’t work on Mac, which it’s not designed for. Whatever the reason, this has been one of the messier rollouts I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory. The story, it seems, is the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;the last time I wrote about iCloud Passwords for Windows&lt;/a&gt;: if you want them, you’ll have to wait a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38qlEt"&gt;Apple was didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is stopping some people from posting feed photos to stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ScEb4_-npAzLyPdoND6uGBMCPqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759782/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQe0RZ"&gt;Instagram is disabling the ability to share (and reshare) posts from your feed to stories as part of a test to see how it changes engagement with the popular feature. The company announced the change in a notification banner sent to users in “select countries” where the test is being conducted, &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-tests-removing-the-option-to-share-feed-posts-within-stories/594255/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Media Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;writes. We’ve reached out to Instagram for specifics on exactly which countries are participating and will update if we hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvh9UE"&gt;“We hear from our community that they want to see fewer posts in Stories,” the notification starts. “During this test, you won’t be able to add a feed post to your Story.” Resharing posts to stories is a fairly common practice, though it does create situations where you’ll see a post in your feed and then immediately see that post duplicated in your friend’s stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xEelxU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;instagram users: I wish people stopped sharing so many feed posts to their Stories&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;instagram: &lt;a href="https://t.co/KQkBbVY45v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KQkBbVY45v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1355090232316743685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6l7VZq"&gt;However annoying this situation may be, it’s worth noting that sharing posts to stories is how many artists, businesses, and organizations get in front of users, due to Instagram’s algorithm favoring friends and family. For example, shoving feed posts in stories opens up the opportunity for the mutual aid organization in your neighborhood to get more donations. Taking away the ability to reshare is responding to a behavior Facebook and Instagram encouraged in the first place by placing stories so prominently in the app and offering the ability to share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWIPWw"&gt;For now, disabling reshares remains a test, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;the changes to likes&lt;/a&gt; the company considered and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/10/21429144/instagram-redesign-test-reels-shopping-adam-mosseri-interview"&gt;the variety of new app layouts it has prototyped&lt;/a&gt;. But the timing is a bit ironic: Twitter is currently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1337111365757100033?s=20"&gt;testing the ability to share tweets to Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt; as stickers. So you might start seeing a lot more reshares in your stories from an entirely different social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7UHfl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For some of you on iOS, we’ll be testing sharing a Tweet as a sticker to Instagram too! Tap the Instagram icon in the Tweet share menu to add the Tweet as a sticker in a Story.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1337111365757100033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>TikTok reduces India staff after long-standing countrywide ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikTok Banned In India" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcO9_NPjD5NuV6g52bSKM1wjps0=/0x104:5035x3461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759734/1223851409.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWGo7c"&gt;More than seven months after India issued a countrywide ban on TikTok, the app is significantly reducing its staffing in the country. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/TikTok-gives-up-on-India-months-after-government-ban"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok was “essentially withdrawing” from India, citing sources familiar with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arbpl7"&gt;Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that it was reducing its workforce in India but disputed the details of &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDLQ6"&gt;In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge: “&lt;/em&gt;Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India... [We] hope to get the chance to relaunch TikTok in India to support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVevEC"&gt;It’s unclear how many employees TikTok will retain. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported that “most” local employees were set to be laid off. Pressed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company did not clarify how many India-based employees will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahfgGs"&gt;India was previously a large market for TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based firm ByteDance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307014/india-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok’s downloads came from India as of April 2020. As of June, the app had about 167 million users in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I21jbv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRDN0q"&gt;TikTok has been banned in India since June 29th. In its &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated that the apps were “engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Htorks"&gt;ByteDance, at the time, did not indicate plans to pull out. Following the announcement, the head of TikTok India issued a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTok_IN/status/1277811841364668416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277811841364668416%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F29%2F21307014%2Findia-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the company had not shared Indian users’ information with the Chinese government and that its practices were in compliance with India’s data privacy and security requirements. “We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications,” the statement read. “We place the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmDoKm"&gt;That wasn’t TikTok’s first quarrel with the Indian government. Indian lawmakers, including the information technology minister of Tamil Nadu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223590/tiktok-india-ban-legislation-government-teens"&gt;called for the app to be banned&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, citing concerns about the behavior of teens and young adults on the service. Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411013/tiktok-india-google-play-block-apple-app-store-bytedance"&gt;pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; from their respective stores in India in mid-April, following a state court request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDObX"&gt;That ban was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;lifted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;j&lt;/a&gt;ust over a week later, and didn’t impact folks who were already using TikTok; it merely prevented new downloads. Even so, TikTok claimed that it suffered up to $500,000 in losses each day the ban was in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsl3EM"&gt;“We are committed to continuously enhancing our safety features as a testament to our ongoing commitment to our users in India,” ByteDance said, following the lift of the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN5itf"&gt;Other countries have long-running security concerns with TikTok as well. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to block transactions between ByteDance and US companies last year but was blocked from doing so by the courts. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150667/tsa-tiktok-employee-ban-bytedance-chuck-schumer-homeland-security"&gt;US government agencies&lt;/a&gt; have banned the use of the app on government-issued devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s new ‘green room’ lets you do an audio / video pre-check</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjBTZJXtkpf0gYvpC_GINLgTbEY=/0x178:934x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759687/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_10.15.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVCcNH"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out how you’re coming across in a videoconference, especially if you want to make sure everything works before you start the meeting. How is your lighting? Are you sitting too close or too far from the camera? Is your audio okay, are you accidentally muted, or do you sound as if you’re in an echo chamber? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8826Jd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/check-video-and-peripheral-device-quality-with-google-meet-self-check.html"&gt;Google has now made it easier&lt;/a&gt; to check your appearance and your tech &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a Meet conference with its new “green room” feature (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/02/google-meet-preview-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When you start or prepare to join a meeting, in the usual “Ready to join?” window that first appears, you will now also see a small button below your video that says “Check your audio and video.” Just click on that button, and a pop-up window will not only show your video image, but allow you to see (and change) which microphone, speaker, and camera is currently live.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet’s “green room” lets you check your audio and video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F35CO0"&gt;A “Next” button on that pop-up window then lets you record a short 6-second video sample, allowing you to see how you will look and sound to the others in your meeting. According to Google, the clip is private to you and will not be saved. Your mic, speaker, camera, and connection are also checked by the system and get green checkmarks if they seem to be working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1e35T"&gt;While previously you could see how you appeared in the initial “Ready to join?” window, Meet’s new “green room” can be even more helpful. For example, you can test various forms of lighting, test whether your laptop’s audio is better or worse than your headset’s, and make sure that you’re looking good before your meeting — with colleagues, friends, or family — starts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vuve0j"&gt;Google Meet’s new “green room” feature is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
