    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a musical take on Tetris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQsuZMGq-HfPbwuAWDVHsnIkPw4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606781/TetrisBeat_Screenshots_4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHmLqz"&gt;Apple Arcade’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;recent expansion&lt;/a&gt; means that the subscription service is now home to plenty of classic games — and things don’t get much more classic than T&lt;em&gt;etris&lt;/em&gt;. Today, Apple announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;, which mashes up the classic block-dropping puzzler with a rhythm game featuring music from the likes of Alison Wonderland, is coming to Arcade “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh3SRo"&gt;There’s no word on a specific release date, but &lt;em&gt;Beat&lt;/em&gt; features 18 exclusive songs, split-screen support if you’re on an Apple TV, and spatial audio for those listening with AirPods. It looks to be yet another inventive take on the game, following the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224853/tetris-99-battle-royale-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;the battle royale &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"&gt;Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s meditative &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tEAy"&gt;The news is also part of a solid run for Apple Arcade. Last week saw the debut of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22568867/altos-odyssey-the-lost-city-apple-arcade-trailer-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while this Friday will include a huge Tokyo expansion for &lt;em&gt;Skate City&lt;/em&gt;, along with mobile classics &lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/1/10699976/neko-atsume-the-game-of-passivity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neko Atsume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also listed as coming soon is the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories&lt;/em&gt; (which coincidentally &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22568610/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-ruin-killing-monsties-guilty-conscience"&gt;just received a sequel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new premium Chromebooks are now available starting at $749.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two models of the Asus Chromebook CX9 sit perpendicular to each other. The one facing the camera displays a birds-eye view of a shoreline." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHk2uq1ZfB235PZnurrjedg1Iz4=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606749/Chromebook_CX9_CX9400_premium_enterprise_resady_Security_titan_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AK9tul"&gt;There are a number of excellent Chromebooks out there, but the race to make the one true successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google’s $999 Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt; is still very much on. Asus is throwing its hat into the ring with two new releases: the Chromebook CX9 and the Chromebook Flip CX5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wi5ZHT"&gt;Both new Chromebooks meet US MIL-STD 810H standards, the company says, meaning they’ve undergone various tests for pressure, shock, drop, and more. Both can also be configured with up to an Intel Core i7 processor with Iris Xe graphics (which will be overkill for all but the most particular of users). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoq2Wa"&gt;The clamshell Chromebook CX9 comes with up to 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a 550-nit UHD touchscreen. (There are FHD touch and non-touch options as well). Asus claims 14 hours of battery life (using a video playback test). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F8vgSc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Best Chromebook 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="39vbbQ"&gt;The CX9 is also the first Chromebook to feature Asus’ NumberPad, an LED num pad that appears on the touchpad when you tap an icon in the top corner. This technology has been handy on previous Asus laptops — it appears on the company’s popular ZenBook line, including the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8Jupa"&gt;The convertible Chromebook Flip CX5 is more standard fare. It offers up to 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM, though the screen is limited to a 1080p touch panel. A USI stylus is included, which Asus claims will get 45 minutes of use from 15 seconds of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPhmlr"&gt;The Asus Chromebook CX9 is available now on Asus’ store — a model with a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202107AM140000004"&gt;Core i3, 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt; will cost $749.99, and a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202107AM140000008"&gt;Core i7 with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt; is $1,149.99. The Chromebook Flip CX5 is $1,049.99, though we haven’t yet been able to find it on the Asus store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube adds a new way to tip creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube on mobile phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vd6uy7DLHeoJcwz1fNyW4F7BrE4=/0x127:2040x1487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606616/cfaulkner_200527_4039_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3g4wy"&gt;YouTube viewers will soon have a new way to throw their support — and money — behind their favorite creators. A new tool called Super Thanks that lets you tip creators is now being tested on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSKw4X"&gt;The feature lets users applaud a creator by choosing from one of four price points between $2 and $50 (or the regional currency equivalent). When a user purchases one of these four options, they’ll see a celebratory animation on-screen and a colorful comment with their name appear below the video in the comments section. Creators themselves will be able to respond to these messages in the same way they can on regular comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-FptiPdSyL3YFwlT0EhlqwwVhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727227/blogPixelFinalgif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new Super Thanks feature shown on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XciY3J"&gt;YouTube has been testing the tool under a separate name, Viewer Applause, over the past year. Now named Super Thanks, it’s available in beta in 68 countries on desktop, Android, and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyZwrw"&gt;Super Thanks is the fourth option YouTube has added for directly paying creators. The platform also offers channel memberships, which let creators offer monthly subscriptions. Then there’s Super Stickers and Super Chat, which let viewers leave tips in chat during livestreams. But where Super Stickers and Chat work on live feeds, Super Thanks can be used across all eligible uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrajtV"&gt;While the feature is launching with four set payment amounts from which to choose, the ability to manually input other dollar amounts is “definitely something that we would be interested in looking to add in,” Barbara Macdonald, a product manager of paid digital goods at YouTube, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. During its earlier testing phase, there had originally only been one price point, but creators told the company that viewers wanted more choice when showing their support for a channel they enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKeKbt"&gt;YouTube pays eligible creators a cut of the ad revenue that runs in front of their videos. But that income stream isn’t always reliable, and it has shrunk considerably at times when advertisers have pulled back from YouTube during controversies. Giving creators options to get paid directly from viewers offers a possible backup revenue stream so they aren’t entirely reliant on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3FSos"&gt;Creators must be part of the YouTube Partner Program to receive access to Super Thanks. The beta launch will be a “randomized rollout,” Macdonald said, before coming to all Partner Program members later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter shares a first look at the ‘big overhaul’ coming to TweetDeck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tweetdeck redesign preview" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGn5WADif4WawPEOVguREkED0fM=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606591/E6v2Gn7WQAEqJmS.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tweetdeck redesign preview | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7egTd8"&gt;Kayvon Beykpour &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321991/twitter-tweetdeck-overhaul-redesign-product-changes"&gt;said in a March interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter does know TweetDeck still exists and the company is working on an overhaul “from the ground up.” Today, Twitter posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499557055827985"&gt;a single image of the reworked app&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that it represents a preview going into testing with a few “randomly-selected” people from the US, Canada, and Australia. If you can’t wait to see it yourself, Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1417520652634836992"&gt;explains how you can opt in to the test right now&lt;/a&gt; with a simple browser tweak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6S2siu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re testing this preview with a small group of randomly-selected people in the United States, Canada, and Australia to start. If you’re eligible, you’ll see an invitation within TweetDeck to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;— TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499557055827985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EvPech"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is reinventing itself","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XdkNME"&gt;TweetDeck powers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s newsroom, and many others, so any changes are likely to meet a skeptical audience of power users, but so far it’s tough to find the improvements. The app’s appeal is in its column views that haven’t changed much over the last decade, but the layout in the screenshot looks very different from what we’re used to, and in the left column a button promotes decks to sort various content types. Otherwise, it looks a lot more like the standard Twitter view, which isn’t why I use TweetDeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3Curg"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971"&gt;a tweet today&lt;/a&gt;, Beykpour said that new features in testing for TweetDeck “include a full Tweet Composer, new advanced search features, new column types, and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces.” Twitter may have more reasons to hope the upgrades are a hit — rumors have said the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272364/twitter-premium-subscriptions-tweetdeck-undo-send-tipping-ads"&gt;considering charging for it in the future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8zRU"&gt;To try out the “new TweetDeck,” just follow Jane’s instructions. Open TweetDeck in your browser, then go to Developer Tools (if you’re using Chrome), open the console tab, copy and paste &lt;strong&gt;document.cookie = “tweetdeck_version=beta” &lt;/strong&gt;then hit enter and reload the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U89ofB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We'll take these lessons into account as we explore what TweetDeck could look like within Twitter's subscription offerings later on. We'll have more to share soon as we learn from these tests.&lt;/p&gt;— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501902149881856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uvh8tS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 20th, 12:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details on how to try the preview version now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to reply to your video comments on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fD6YnWx1NZLtNZHB8WVGCZSrS6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606151/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7jrog"&gt;If you’re a video creator on TikTok, then your comment section could be really frustrating, especially if somebody leaves a comment that completely misinterprets what you’ve been saying (to say the least). You could send a text reply or simply create another video, but according to TikTok, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video"&gt;now you have a third option&lt;/a&gt;: you can reply to your comments using video rather than text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nknc1w"&gt;(Note: since this is something specifically for creators who want to video-reply to comments, we haven’t been able to test it yet. If / when we do, we’ll let you know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkph2Z"&gt;To add a video to a comment on one of your existing TikTok videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1LM3kU"&gt;Tap on the comment you want to reply to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BLop4W"&gt;If you have the ability to reply using a video, you’ll see an icon of a video camera on the left side of the field. Tap that icon. You can also press and hold the comment you want to reply to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6qMA0N"&gt;Record your video as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LoOBp0"&gt;If you wish, you can have the comment that your video is replying to attached to that video. This will allow anyone who views your video separately to see what you’re responding to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QCm7Ot"&gt;Post the video as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I8aPCd"&gt;Your video will be available both in the comments section (of the video you’ve commented on) and on your own page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QFs7Ag"&gt;Got it? If not, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935521116114914566?sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6880557340434466310&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0"&gt;TikTok has a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWpKbr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6824578676303154438" data-video-id="6824578676303154438" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to reply to a comment with a video?

    <title>How Capcom used motion capture to bring Resident Evil Village’s scariest monsters to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEZnZk-Gl7yndxOzX0cnZuyzWSw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605980/RE_Village_Jan21_Screens_Lady_Dimitrescu.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Presentation director Masato Miyazaki on animating the likes of Lady Dimitrescu&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gpLPdR"&gt;When it came to the motion capture for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, the team at Capcom had a big challenge — literally. The horror game’s standout character was the nine-feet, six-inch-tall Lady Dimitrescu. She’s around three feet taller than actress Maggie Robertson, who handled both the character’s voice and performance capture. For presentation director Masato Miyazaki, this created a dilemma. He could’ve outfitted Robertson with some kind of prosthetic or prop to make her appear larger, but that would have restricted her ability to move around and act in a natural way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDEzqE"&gt;So the team did something more drastic. “We had to figure out how to adjust the environment to accommodate the height difference,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That meant building two different sets; one at a normal human size, the other designed for Dimitrescu’s towering frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aIXgp"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; is best known for its undead zombies, the franchise has steadily expanded to other monsters. With &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; that included not only Dimitrescu and her vampiric cohort, but even more outlandish creatures like werewolves, living dolls, and a particularly creepy baby. This meant coming up with inventive ways to utilize motion capture to give these monsters a lifelike feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="43oTIm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10660273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AqS6xN"&gt;The approach differed depending on the creature. Some movements were handled entirely by animators, while others utilized a hybrid approach; actors performed motion capture, which was then cleaned up or changed by the animators. “For monsters, we typically require an actor with greater physical prowess capable of moving in ways that an average person would have difficulty executing,” Miyazaki says. “We were able to hire a fantastic stuntman who did great work for us in the past in animating the Licker enemy [from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. His performance provides photorealistic movements as a constant guide. The movements are then brushed up by the animators to be properly corrected and exaggerated as per the monster’s skeleton.” (The team was also able to consult with the developers of the &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/12/17003972/monster-hunter-world-motion-capture-video"&gt;which has similarly used human actors for inhuman roles&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmKOMC"&gt;Miyazaki says that Lady Dimitrescu was the most challenging to animate due to her sheer size. In addition to building two different versions of the sets, the team had to place markers so the actors knew “where everyone’s eye line should be.” Her model also required lots of post-production work. “We took great care in making sure the character rigs could absorb all of the motion capture information as smoothly as possible,” Miyazaki explains. “Whether it was Lady Dimitrescu or some other anomalous being like Angie or Moreau, there would be differences between the actor and the character, and we created the rigs with these differences in mind. Miscalculations would naturally be made along the way, but we wanted to make sure those changes could be corrected relatively easier when the animators started working on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil Village" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IP8GCucWHWQAq2W-KBMuuf92Rzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728191/RE_Village_Apr_2021_Screens_03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45i5DP"&gt;But while Dimitrescu was the most challenging, Miyazaki says that it was another character that had the most unique requirements: Salvatore Moreau, a sort of human / fish creature with a bent spine. “We had a very serious discussion about whether it would be creepier if the actor performed with his body bent, or whether the actor should act natural and then process the animation afterward to make sure the posture wouldn’t impact his performance,” he says. (A few other behind-the-scenes tidbits: the baby character, Rose, was motion captured with an adult woman acting in place of a newborn, and for the gruesome scene where protagonist Ethan reattaches his severed hand, “we used a cylindrical prop that covered that section of the arm and acted as a fake hand that we could record coming on and off during recording,” says Miyazaki.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pmetnf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We questioned whether we were going to be able to complete things on time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Y6wy"&gt;These challenges were exacerbated by the fact that the game’s development was hit by the pandemic, which made performance capture particularly difficult. “We questioned whether we were going to be able to complete things on time,” Miyazaki says of the pandemic’s impact. “We hadn’t filmed the last section of the game, nor the ending itself, so you can imagine how scary the situation was.” While they were still able to film, there were restrictions in place, like social distancing, limits for the number of people on set, and staff directing actors remotely while they quarantined at home. Those on set even communicated via radios to limit face-to-face interactions. To get around at least some of the challenges, the team was forced to create a new dedicated space for motion capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaKNy1"&gt;“We had to find a way to tackle things all remotely,” Miyazaki says. “We knew that this would inevitably cause communication problems, so what we ended up doing was building a dedicated filming environment. This environment allowed for real-time exchange of video and data captured in the studio, so that we could effectively convey our thoughts and direction, even when being literally across the globe from each other. I am truly grateful to the studio technical director in Los Angeles who was able to change the studio setup — cameras and communication equipment — to accommodate this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VfZzSt"&gt;The director says that, despite all of the terrifying monsters his team was able to create, it was this aspect — dealing with the challenges of the pandemic — that he’s most proud of. “We could have easily thrown up our hands and deemed it impossible to complete, but the actors, internal staff, and external staff all came together in making things happen,” he says. “I really felt the sense of responsibility and love for the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; franchise. It was an experience that really moved me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony might have made the perfect soundbar for PS5 and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzmj-DjbgOnhLSPCC2UgcFYw3mk=/94x0:1186x728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605786/HT_A7000_complete_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ju1Jb2"&gt;Sony has just announced two new high-end home theater audio systems, both of which include HDMI 2.1 passthrough ports that offer full support for features like 8K video, 4K gaming at 120Hz, Dolby Vision HDR, eARC, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uqH4A"&gt;First up is the &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/hta7000"&gt;HT-A7000 Dolby Atmos 7.1.2-channel soundbar&lt;/a&gt;. Priced at $1,299.99, the soundbar has two HDMI 2.1 inputs, so theoretically you could run &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X into this thing and play each console to its full potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zytoXW"&gt;Positioned as Sony’s latest flagship soundbar, the A7000 has two up-firing speakers for Atmos, two beam tweeters, and five front speakers for wider surround. There’s a built-in dual subwoofer, but if you need deeper bass, you can pay extra for a standalone sub; Sony’s selling a 300-watt wireless subwoofer for $699.99 or a 200-watt unit for $399.99. The company is also selling wireless rear surrounds for $349.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ipU2tH_yy0wwun5QeTGwnacVDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726523/HT_A7000_main.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6MgG4P"&gt;We’re still in the early days of future-proofed HDMI 2.1 soundbars, but they’re starting to appear: Klipsch just announced a similar Atmos bar called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.klipsch.com%2Fproducts%2Fcinema-1200-sound-bar-and-surround-system&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22583815%2Fsony-hta9-hta7000-soundbar-specs-features-ps5-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Cinema 1200&lt;/a&gt;. It also has two HDMI inputs, though the $1,699 price includes a bundled subwoofer and surrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VfgBQ5KCq41u15j7dDNukG0dGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728215/HT_A7000_rear.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A7000 has two HDMI 2.1 inputs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WGa7UC"&gt;As has become relatively common for premium soundbars, Sony’s A7000 can tune itself for a room’s acoustics, using a microphone on the remote to “measure the height and width of a room” and optimize the sound profile. It supports 360 Reality Audio, hi-res audio, and is compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Chromecast, Spotify Connect, and Apple AirPlay 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mo9BYSkTJDS-0mBA6h89XO3_mM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728211/HT_A9_main_All.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A9 system uses four wireless speakers and a small control box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5yD0FU"&gt;The second, pricier new audio system is called the HT-A9, and it consists of four wireless speakers and a control box unit that’s similar in size to an Apple TV. Sony says you can place the four cylinder-shaped speakers pretty much anywhere in a room, and the sound field optimization will take their position into account when tuning the audio performance. (The back of each speaker is flat for convenient mounting.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doAgjr"&gt;With these, the company is also including what it calls “360 spatial sound mapping technology,” which can supposedly “create up to twelve ‘phantom’ speakers from just four speakers by synthesizing sound waves based on positional information.” Those sound like big claims, but for a price of $1,799.99, I’d hope Sony could deliver on some of that sound field trickery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tWC8QFWMmAo53sqLmt4aHMP0Eg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728212/HT_A9_Music_lifestyle.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless speakers allow for flexible placement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p8uRDL"&gt;Each speaker measures a bit over 12 inches tall. The A9 has just one HDMI input rather than the two on the soundbar, but the control box also has an ethernet jack and an aux port that allows compatible Sony TVs to act as the center channel. That should make for excellent voice clarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brmBb4"&gt;One downside is that each speaker needs its own power outlet — as does the control box — so you’re looking at a total of five outlets. Since this system leans on wireless so much, I’m also curious about any latency or audio sync issues that might pop up when gaming. Sony told me it hasn’t encountered any such problems, but it’s something I’d want to be sure of. The A9 is clearly meant for people who don’t want to fuss with wires (except for the power cords) in their home theater surround setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2bxN6"&gt;Both the HT-A7000 and HT-A9 will start shipping sometime between September and October, according to Sony. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is also switching to Android Messages as default for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZHxdIDdhTmygFE3Ihttsj-XPac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605640/rcs_static.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2m9QY"&gt;Beginning next year, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-messaging-services-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon will join AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile in preloading Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as the default texting app on all Android phones it sells. It’s the final step for making RCS Chat — the next-gen standard designed to replace SMS — the default experience for Android. In the US, that only leaves one large cohort that will not use RCS as a default SMS replacement: iPhone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbOmp"&gt;Verizon has also said it will fully support interoperability between carriers, so in theory the improved images, video, read receipts, and group chats should just work — assuming everybody you’re texting with is also using Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oy5tR"&gt;Verizon was the last of the big three US carriers to get on board with Google’s latest strategy to push RCS as the new default for texting. After years of cajoling, shaming, and downright pleading, the company has made deals with carriers to simply use the standard Android Messages app, which supports RCS by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UdagT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AT&amp;amp;amp;T joins T-Mobile in switching all Android phones to Google’s Messages app for RCS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"},{"title":"T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"},{"title":"EXCLUSIVE: CHAT IS GOOGLE’S NEXT BIG FIX FOR ANDROID’S MESSAGING MESS ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17252486/google-android-messages-chat-rcs-anil-sabharwal-imessage-texting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dLNUl0"&gt;Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS, and the Play Store, is quick to note that end-to-end encryption for RCS inside Android Messages is also in the process of rolling out. It’s available for “peer-to-peer” chats (i.e. a chat with one other person), but group chats are on the roadmap as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah3HiB"&gt;Default, end-to-end encrypted chats between Android phones raise an interesting conundrum for Apple. Next year, texts between Android phones and iPhones will be less secure than texts within those two ecosystems — because they will be on SMS instead of RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2PUe2"&gt;Apple’s Messages app offers end-to-end encryption if all users are on the iMessage system, and it has shown no appetite to either offer iMessage on Android nor to adopt RCS on the iPhone. Google, meanwhile, is happy to take the opportunity to needle Apple by openly inviting it to use RCS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IiDxaT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="container"&gt;“Going forward, the default messaging experience on Android is going to be more secure,” says Lockheimer, who has previously invited Apple to adopt RCS. “The fallback messaging experience on the other platform will not have encryption if it’s still SMS. I think that that is a pretty interesting dynamic and I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part of the discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaFqbW"&gt;Lockheimer wouldn’t confirm if Google is in active discussions with Apple, but it doesn’t seem as though RCS is likely to come to the iPhone soon and the company has declined to comment on the matter several times over the years. But there is clearly a pressure campaign on, even if it’s not very strident. Speaking about Apple adoption, Lockheimer says, “I actually do think getting the three major carriers in the US to adopt RCS in a consistent manner is a big part of the equation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiSTq3"&gt;Currently, there are 473 million monthly active RCS users around the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/rcs/"&gt;according to the GSMA&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption in the US is likely to boost that number by quite a bit. Google has no plans to try to introduce a messaging app that supports RCS on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbd3J"&gt;Although RCS has been closely associated with Google, the company often points to the fact that it is meant to be a standard that is shared by the entire mobile industry and managed by the GSMA. Carriers are able to use their own RCS infrastructure instead of Google’s. Still, RCS is closely tied to Google in many people’s minds and Google offers RCS services to carriers and will even allow consumers to directly use RCS via its services if their carrier doesn’t offer it. Google began pushing RCS as the new texting experience on Android after its own messaging attempts (notably Hangouts and Allo) floundered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xlX5hJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RCS rollout has been a long, complicated slog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTm6tu"&gt;Lockheimer claims that Google prefers the slightly more open RCS approach to a Google-owned texting solution being the default on Android. “We don’t think there should be one messaging app to rule them all. We fully realize people are going to use multiple messaging apps,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BERDuW"&gt;As for Verizon, it will continue to offer its Verizon Message+ (VM+) application alongside Android Messages for customers who wish to use it. It’s a maligned app and for good reason: it’s rife with awkward interface controls and Verizon branding — but since it’s really the only way to sync Verizon text messages across different devices, it’s going to stick around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7TrxU"&gt;Apparently Verizon and Google intend to find a way to ensure that VM+ and Android Messages share a text message database so that messages stay in sync. That’s potentially a first step toward opening up RCS to third-party applications — something that’s been impossible so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJUX3W"&gt;Google’s deal with Verizon caps a flurry of RCS activity that kicked off this past March with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile deal&lt;/a&gt;, then the end of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534173/google-android-summer-features-earthquake-messages-emoji-kitchen-auto-voice-access"&gt;encrypted chat beta in June&lt;/a&gt;, and finally a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;deal with AT&amp;amp;T in June&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4Junm"&gt;Unfortunately, as with all things Android and RCS, the results of that activity won’t be felt by users until later. Verizon won’t be making the switch to Android Messages until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGXtCf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin successfully sends Jeff Bezos and three others to space and back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3rOW3p3voMQKQiv-WxNhm8IXkhU=/0x0:2886x1924/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605622/1329690430.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRCFbX"&gt;Jeff Bezos launched to the edge of space Tuesday morning with three fellow passengers and landed safely in a Texas desert aboard his space company’s crew capsule. The NS-16 mission marked Blue Origin’s first to carry humans and kicked off commercial service for the company’s space tourism business. Flying Bezos, the richest man in the world who founded Blue Origin in 2000, sent a signal to prospective space tourists that the company’s suborbital New Shepard rocket is safe to fly and open for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1v1xB"&gt;The six-story-tall New Shepard booster lifted off under clear skies at 9:12AM ET on Tuesday from its remote launch site in Van Horn, Texas, with the company’s gumdrop-shaped&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;RSS First Step&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;crew capsule fixed on top. Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation legend Wally Funk, and Dutch teen Oliver Daemen — who represented Blue Origin’s first paying customer — were strapped inside the capsule. The crew capsule sped to a peak altitude of 66 miles at three times the speed of sound before parting with the booster. The passengers experienced a brief feeling of weightlessness and could see the curvature of Earth on the brim of its atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mFe04"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos: “My main mission was accomplished — I didn’t kick anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KY0Ou"&gt;“My main mission was accomplished — I didn’t kick anyone,” Bezos quipped after his capsule touched down. “I was surprised at how easy zero-G was... it was like swimming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49g75i"&gt;The mission made Funk, 82, the oldest person to reach space, and Daemen, 18, the youngest. Bezos has said launching to space has been his dream since he was a kid. He became the second billionaire to ride his own rocket to space, after Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson who flew on his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane on July 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bpdae07Lm82KKfBdl63msRBDuZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728257/jeff_emerges.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Bezos emerges from his company’s crew capsule after reaching space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z82lib"&gt;The New Shepard booster landed vertically on a concrete pad five miles from where it launched, capping the third haul to space for that particular booster. Before Tuesday’s flight, Blue Origin had conducted 15 uncrewed test launches of its New Shepard rocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWxEPY"&gt;The company has yet to reveal the price it charges for each seat and has declined to offer any ballpark figures. The rocket’s most recent test flight in April was an “astronaut rehearsal” mission, where company executives roleplayed as passengers in the moments leading up to liftoff. “Every mission we’ve conducted so far has been preparing us to put humans on board,” Blue Origin’s NS-16 flight director Steve Lanius told reporters on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JyYUY"&gt;The passenger seat occupied by Daemen, a recent high school grad from the Netherlands, was initially reserved for the anonymous winner of an auction that Blue Origin carried out in June. That winner bid $28 million to fly but rescheduled for a later New Shepard mission “due to scheduling conflicts.” Blue Origin spokespeople declined to identify the bidder or expand on the scheduling issues. Daemen’s father, founder and CEO of a Dutch private equity firm, had bought a seat on New Shepard’s next mission in the fall and was bumped up to the first flight instead. He gave the seat to his son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IBSnDE"&gt;Tuesday’s flight was a long-sought success for the company as it faces aggressive competition from other space firms like Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Blue Origin had pitched New Glenn, its much larger rocket system in development in Florida, to the Air Force for a multibillion-dollar launch program, but it lost to SpaceX and its other rival United Launch Alliance. In April, NASA rejected Blue Moon, the company’s proposed human lunar lander. The agency opted to pick SpaceX’s Starship system instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fi0qmq"&gt;Blue Origin launches New Shepard from its Launch Site One facility in Van Horn, a remote town in West Texas roughly 70 miles from the US-Mexico border. The first iteration of the rocket began as a smaller concept called Goddard, which debuted in 2006. New Shepard, launched for the first time in 2015 but crashed during its attempt to land. All other flights have been successful, giving Blue Origin the confidence to send its billionaire founder on the rocket’s inaugural crewed mission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T4dAo4"&gt;“We know the vehicle is safe. If the vehicle is not safe for me, it’s not safe for anyone,” Bezos told CNN in an interview Monday morning. Blue Origin engineers conducted some real-time evaluations with some of NS-16’s passengers midflight, and post-mission data reviews will provide hoards of data to inform any changes to the passenger experience in the future. Lessons learned from New Shepard flights will inform Blue Origin’s other vehicles, like New Glenn and Blue Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox adds new file conversion tools and faster camera backups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_mg2UFkYmi-MBtDJ8h1bZSvEkgo=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605470/Camera_uploads.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camera uploads should now be faster and more reliable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtBlqQ"&gt;Dropbox is getting a slew of interface tweaks alongside new tools and features. One of the more useful inclusions is a new file conversion feature, which lets Dropbox users convert images between different formats like JPEG and PNG, and files into PDFs. Support for video conversion is coming soon. Dropbox is also adding new features to its password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asMISF"&gt;Automatic camera backups from mobile, which will now be available to users on Dropbox’s free tier, are also seeing some improvements. Dropbox says uploads should now be faster and more reliable, and on iOS there’s now an option to specify exactly which folders should be automatically backed up (the feature is coming to Android later this year). There’s also the option to have photos automatically deleted after they’re backed up to save space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ekk1--dNLQvFKrzGhYo8XqPstHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728020/Redesigned_details_pane.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The web interface’s details pane has also been redesigned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEvsBg"&gt;The service’s password manager, which it made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332829/dropbox-passwords-manager-added-free-basic-account"&gt;available to free account holders&lt;/a&gt; in April, is being updated to store credit and debit card details while a password sharing feature announced in March is now rolling out. Dropbox’s password manager is available to both its free and paid account holders, but free accounts are limited to storing a maximum of 50 passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6q7jl"&gt;Finally, on the web Dropbox is updating its side navigation interface, making it easier to organize files through dragging and dropping. The details pane is also being overhauled to offer more details on your files at a glance. Desktop users are also getting a simplified interface from their system tray, with “streamlined access to content, search, file activity, and sync progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
