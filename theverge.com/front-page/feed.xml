    <title>Digital messages from patients to doctors spiked during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncuwgc"&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1438151472089239555"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they’re overwhelmed by the volume of digital messages they receive from patients during the pandemic, and new data backs up their experience. The number of messages increased by over 150 percent at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the levels stayed high over the course of 2020, according to an early look at data from the electronic health record company Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsOWcy"&gt;“They want to be responsive to the patient needs,” says A Jay Holmgren, an assistant professor in the Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research at the University of California San Francisco, who collected the data and posted it on Twitter this week. But there aren’t good systems in place to help doctors to manage the influx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wosjCI"&gt;There are few reasons why messaging might have spiked, Holmgren says. At the start of the pandemic, people may have wanted to avoid going to the doctor’s office and messaged their doctors instead. The pandemic might also have made people more aware that the option existed — and they stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZqNI5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic might also have made people more aware that the option existed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECoFh"&gt;“People started making telehealth appointments, those exploded around the pandemic,” he says. Patients would have had to use the online portal through their electronic health record to set up the appointment, where they may have seen the messaging option for the first time. Because messaging stayed high over 2020 — even at times COVID-19 cases were lower — Holmgren suspects that might play a bigger role. “I think it’s more of an awareness thing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNcJQD"&gt;Epic shared data on patient messaging with Holmgren as part of a project he’s working on looking at how use of electronic health records changed during the pandemic. It includes information from 366 health systems. Individual patients’ information is not included, so he can’t see what types of patients may have sent the messages or what they messaged about. But it gives an overall picture of the increase, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdnhM7"&gt;Holmgren posted the data on Twitter as part of a conversation about overloaded inboxes and physician burnout. “We turned on 24/7/365 access for patients (who of course like it) with no operational or business model to handle it,” wrote Bob Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1ceJdy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a real thing, and to quantify somewhat - national data from Epic shows messages from patients received per day up 157% over pre-pandemic amounts through end of 2020 (y-axis is percent change compared to health system's pre-COVID baseline) &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQoAWCi2YM"&gt;https://t.co/bQoAWCi2YM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4XirrOliFW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4XirrOliFW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— A Jay Holmgren (@AJHolmgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJHolmgren/status/1438191114511523844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKbdeU"&gt;Messages from patients are a small portion of the dozens of emails most doctors get each day, and the raw number of messages directly from patients is probably still low, Holmgren says — they may have started with one or two messages a day before 2020, and then received three or four a day from patients during 2020. “But these are the messages that take the most time,” he says. “If a patient asks you a question, you really need to answer it either by messaging them back, or scheduling an appointment or phone call.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pcS6O"&gt;It’s not clear yet what messages are primarily used for: they might be replacing doctor’s appointments in some cases. But they could also be unnecessary additions in other situations. A better understanding of why people are messaging their doctors, overall, could help develop strategies for managing the influx — like methods of sorting or directing messages, and ways to align the costs with the amount of work. That would benefit both physicians and patients. “You could get into this position where you can send your message, but the doctor doesn’t respond for a couple of weeks because they’re so overloaded with messages,” Holmgren says. “Then it’s not a useful tool anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f67INH"&gt;Improvements could help build a better foundation for at-home healthcare. There are more and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526024/apple-health-app-data-medical-record-iphone-doctor-access"&gt;more tools&lt;/a&gt; available to give doctors information on patients’ health day-to-day, in between appointments, but it takes experience with digital systems to make use of them. “You want to be able to message with your patients electronically before you start installing remote patient monitoring, or using wearables that automatically send you oxygen stats,” Holmgren says. “This is a good way to start building to that next level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtahah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A privacy-focused permissions feature from Android 11 is coming to older phones too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgaquvQgZ2gKVdTnItmzMkM6k1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872738/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AS99BC"&gt;Android 11’s auto-resetting permissions, where the operating system will restrict an app’s permission to access sensitive phone features like its storage or cameras if it hasn’t been opened for several months, are coming to older devices, Google has announced. The feature originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;launched with Android 11&lt;/a&gt; last year, but soon it’ll be available on any phones running Android 6 and above with Google Play services, which Google says should cover “billions” of Android phones released since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCyqqr"&gt;The feature is designed to help protect your privacy by preventing older apps from having unfettered access to your phone if you haven’t used them in months. You might be happy to give a novelty camera app access to your storage while it’s all the rage, but there’s a good chance you’ll forget it’s installed soon after. Android’s security feature is designed to step in and reset these permissions once it becomes clear that an app is no longer in regular use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wb3QTR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automatically enabled on Android 6.0 and up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWVJ2P"&gt;According to Google, the feature “will automatically be enabled on devices with Google Play services that are running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.” However, it has to be enabled manually for apps that aren’t targeting Android 11. Apps might ask users to disable this privacy feature if they’re regularly required to work in the background without you opening them, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXZn6E"&gt;According to Google, the feature will begin to roll out in December on devices running Android 6 to Android 10 with Google Play Services, before reaching all such devices in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot continues to expand beyond League of Legends with new PC launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVD0MCifF3ftS6wJD76AFmRspAo=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872503/valorant.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the new Riot Client.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Riot Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jcQmem"&gt;Riot Games is perhaps best known for developing &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but in recent years, it’s added games like auto battler &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt; and the hit shooter &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; to its roster of titles. To make it easier to open all of Riot’s games on your PC, the company is releasing the Riot Client, a unified launcher that starts rolling out later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp3pLB"&gt;“All desktop Riot games will be accessible from one client, with each game having its own dedicated product page with game-specific content including the latest news and events,” Riot’s Liz La Londe &lt;a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/new-riot-client-coming-soon?utm_source=twitter100088109&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=100002493433761&amp;amp;utm_campaign=riot_careers&amp;amp;linkId=100000068118128"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “You’ll be able to clean up your desktop and only have one Riot Client launcher where all your favorite Riot games will live! However, if you prefer, you can maintain your existing game desktop shortcuts for a direct path to your favorite game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjWWul"&gt;You can get an idea of what the new launcher will look like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STq3rFUtqBE"&gt;in this video from Riot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htyGl0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STq3rFUtqBE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLSDFT"&gt;Riot is taking a staggered approach to rolling out the Riot Client to ensure that it works well. The client will begin rolling out on September 20th, but the worldwide rollout won’t start until October 4th, and La Londe said that date is “subject to change if the team requires any updates or changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaPvLa"&gt;The new client could be important for Riot as it continues to expand its game library. It has a number of titles in the works, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22187980/riot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; MMO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541766/league-of-legends-spin-off-ruined-king-release-date-early-2021-xbox-playstation-switch"&gt;a single-player &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, and a fighting game featuring &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; characters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;codenamed “Project L.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Man who unlocked nearly 2 million AT&amp;T phones gets 12 years in prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ffA3FMgQnYuDOhWIF_-ao2nzJ9c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872392/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Man who pleaded guilty in a phone-unlocking case sentenced to prison | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pV3pLw"&gt;A man who the Department of Justice says unlocked AT&amp;amp;T customers’ phones for a fee was sentenced to 12 years in prison, in what the judge called “a terrible cybercrime over an extended period,” which allegedly continued even after authorities were on to the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBuDgD"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/fraudster-sentenced-prison-long-running-phone-unlocking-scheme-defrauded-att"&gt;news release from the DOJ&lt;/a&gt;, in 2012, Muhammad Fahd, a citizen of Pakistan and Grenada, contacted an AT&amp;amp;T employee via Facebook and offered the employee “significant sums of money” to help him secretly unlock AT&amp;amp;T phones, freeing the customers from any installment agreement payments and from AT&amp;amp;T’s service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xzJDB"&gt;Fahd used the alias Frank Zhang, according to the DOJ, and persuaded the AT&amp;amp;T employee to recruit other employees at its call center in Bothell, Washington, to help with the elaborate scheme. Fahd instructed the AT&amp;amp;T employees to set up fake businesses and phony bank accounts to receive payments, and to create fictitious invoices for deposits into the fake accounts to create the appearance that money exchanged as part of the scheme was payment for legitimate services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQH2QO"&gt;In 2013, however, AT&amp;amp;T put into place a new unlocking system which made it harder for Fahd’s crew to unlock phones’ unique IMEI numbers, so according to the DOJ he hired a developer to design malware that could be installed on AT&amp;amp;T’s computer system. This allegedly allowed him to unlock more phones, and do so more efficiently. The AT&amp;amp;T employees working with Fahd helped him access information about its systems and other employees’ credentials, allowing his developer to tailor the malware more precisely, the DOJ said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2ePck"&gt;A forensic analysis by AT&amp;amp;T showed Fahd and his helpers fraudulently unlocked more than 1.9 million phones, costing the company more than $200 million. Fahd was arrested in Hong Kong in 2018 and extradited to the US in 2019. He pleaded guilty in September 2020 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfQ3wT"&gt;It’s not clear from the DOJ release whether anyone besides AT&amp;amp;T was harmed as a result of the scheme; there’s no mention of customers’ phones being otherwise compromised or any personal data being accessed. We’ve reached out to the DOJ to clarify whether any AT&amp;amp;T customers were affected. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google bend to Russian government pressure on voting app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RUSSIA-VOTE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHLMyJx_3SrPKpN5DvK36BkwXZM=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872173/1235291316.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pmmzVb"&gt;Apple and Google have removed jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s voting app from the iOS and Android stores under pressure from the government. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/russia-navalny-app-election.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the removal followed threats to criminally prosecute company employees within Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="099tR2"&gt;A spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin told reporters that the app was “illegal” and Apple and Google had acted “in accordance with the law.” On Twitter, Navalny aide Ivan Zhdanov &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ioannzh/status/1438738677371482126?s=21"&gt;called its removal&lt;/a&gt; “a shameful act of political censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP1u5q"&gt;The Russian government has mounted a sustained campaign against Navalny’s app, which was meant to rally voters against Putin’s party in Russia’s parliamentary election. The country’s internet censor &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/02/russia-apple-google-censor-navalny/"&gt;threatened earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; to fine Apple and Google, alleging that keeping the app on the store constituted election interference. Apple briefly stalled updates to the app, but neither company removed it at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DQVgx7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies were threatened with fines earlier this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4x1PUJ"&gt;Russian censors have blocked websites linked to Navalny, and the pressure on Apple and Google is part of a larger crackdown on foreign tech companies. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/russias-twitter-throttling-may-give-censors-never-before-seen-capabilities/"&gt;Twitter was throttled&lt;/a&gt; in Russia for allegedly failing to remove illegal content, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-fines-facebook-not-deleting-banned-content-2021-09-14/"&gt;a court fined Twitter and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (as well as messaging app Telegram) over illegal content earlier this week. A court &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-court-fines-tiktok-15-mln-roubles-not-deleting-banned-content-2021-05-27/"&gt;fined TikTok&lt;/a&gt; for similar offenses in May. Apple and Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9coOHI"&gt;Apple has received past criticism for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907596/apple-hong-kong-protests-app-removed-china"&gt;removing protest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287436/pocket-casts-castro-china-apple-government-pressure"&gt;media apps&lt;/a&gt; in China. The Navalny app removal also threatens to undermine one of its arguments in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;recent privacy controversy&lt;/a&gt; over scanning iCloud photos. While Apple says that technology would be strictly limited to finding child sexual abuse material, skeptics fear the company could cave to pressure from authoritarian governments to expand it — something Apple has strongly denied it will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkZOe3"&gt;“Apple’s defense of removing voting guides is that they have to obey the law of the nations they operate in. And yet if legislators demand they expand their image scanning corpus, they say they will refuse,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1438845583905759234"&gt;tweeted John Hopkins University professor and cryptographer Matthew Green&lt;/a&gt;, one of the scanning system’s most prominent critics. “They intend to break the law in that case, but not this one?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the accessories you’ll need for your PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKR_P301-r_RAX5aYlCy2lUGo0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67755669/vpavic_4278_20201030_0345.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8EKGm6"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21314187"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is still incredibly difficult to find. Whether you got lucky with a launch unit, or are still trying to snag one for yourself, picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand new console (whenever you get one) isn’t a bad idea. From headsets and remotes to M.2 SSDs that allow you to expand your console’s storage capacity — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;that’s a thing now&lt;/a&gt;, after all — these are just a few PS5 accessories we suggest picking up from the get-go, some of which are now available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can adjust location services for specific apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSpH0kbFBBPq3Pdd52RfatmGL9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857412/IMG_13B4445EF110_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust location services for specific apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How you can allow location access depends on the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpBbvHInOumIiH0y2cORf5Nv3bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857413/IMG_6D2F84330D37_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BI4ULPUOLpp4D6EXdpLY1UeSoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857589/IMG_11AB5BCB37D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is offering 50 percent off ad-free plan for six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZmTrL1QjsrjImwcjSBD7YO_Slb4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871772/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OK2KJz"&gt;HBO Max has started running an enticing deal where you can pay half price for the ad-free subscription tier, bringing it to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HBOMaxDiscount091721&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe/plan-picker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $7.49 per month&lt;/a&gt;. That rate, which is even lower than the ad-sponsored plan, will be good for up to six months, after which you’ll be switched back to the standard $14.99. You’ve got to act relatively quickly to take advantage of the offer: it’s available through September 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="656cx7"&gt;WarnerMedia is promoting the deal to people who formerly subscribed to HBO through Amazon’s Prime Video Channels. As of September 15th, you can no longer subscribe to HBO through Amazon. So this is a sweetener to bring those customers over to a standalone HBO Max subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2i5on"&gt;But it’s also available to pretty much everyone else — except for active subscribers, that is. WarnerMedia says “new and returning HBO Max subscribers” can pay the reduced monthly rate for up to six months. You can sign up at &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HBOMaxDiscount091721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBOMax.com&lt;/a&gt; or activate your subscription through the HBO Max app on Apple, Roku, Google, LG, Microsoft, Sony, or Vizio devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6l7y5"&gt;In recent weeks, HBO Max has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608403/hbo-max-new-subscribers-free-episodes"&gt;offered free episodes&lt;/a&gt; to non-subscribers. And earlier this month, WarnerMedia announced that the service will launch in parts of Europe (beginning with Spain and the Nordics) on October 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Half-Life: Alyx is a must-play VR game for $36</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UdEFu8Ucyg8Y4jVHXRTtglAR9M4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871553/COMBINE_ELEVATOR_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OgYATr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; belongs in every VR headset owner’s library of games, especially when it costs 40 percent less than usual. This game was released right at the start of the pandemic in early 2020 for $60, and while it’s worth every bit of that price, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;I highly suggest taking advantage of this deal, which drops the game to just $36&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does the game satisfy with respect to its story, which serves as the prequel to &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; (you &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;need to see the ending), it’s a fantastic experience full of imaginative VR gameplay that makes every environment feel like a sandbox. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrpWXc"&gt;You don’t need a high-end, wired VR headset to play this game. Grabbing an Oculus Quest or Quest 2 tether-free headset will do just fine (thanks to the free Air Link feature, you can wirelessly stream VR games to your headset over Wi-Fi — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;here’s how&lt;/a&gt;). But you will need a fast PC capable of running &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RuEm5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10408507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CjeMan"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals09172021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is still hosting its great $30-off preorder promo&lt;/a&gt; on the latest iPad model (which hasn’t released yet). Preorders cost $299 instead of $329, so check that out if you want to save some money. But if you had your eye on the pricier, yet smaller new iPad Mini with a USB-C charging port, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F168720858&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals091721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a preorder deal on that&lt;/a&gt;, too. The 64GB model can be yours for $459 instead of $499. Currently, the retailer has several colors available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fWXS4w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kEZ8Zq"&gt;If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;preordering any of the iPhone 13 phones&lt;/a&gt; today, you may want to pick up a MagSafe magnetic charger that’ll help you avoid fussing with cables. Normally $40 through Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MagSafe-Charger%2F233730734&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals091721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are matching their discounts by charging just over $27 for the charger. In addition to charging your iPhone 13 or 12 series device, the MagSafe can serve as a Qi charger for other devices like AirPods that support wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9WPcQM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yYwh9D"&gt;If a little extra storage can go a long way, this deal definitely goes the distance. Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfA75mJ40Iz#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $80 on WD’s 5TB Easystore&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy. This slim, external hard drive is a fantastic solution for archiving massive amounts of media without having to worry about making space. At less than an inch thick and weighing less than a pound, it’s easy to make room for this drive in any bag. It does rely on an older USB 3.0 connection for file transfers, and won’t support the same transfer speeds seen in modern SSDs, but for anyone looking for a cheap and efficient bulk storage solution for their files, this beefier version of the WD Easystore fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yqaaBZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9511198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I0cpYt0rl8mleij3fc6Gffrv5yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8261473/Ghost_Shell_1995_Screenshot_0684.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZADdHI"&gt;Pick up a discounted UHD Blu-ray copy of the seminal anime film &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752220832472180268" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy for just $12&lt;/a&gt;. This version was released on the 25th anniversary of the film’s launch, and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/8/21427354/ghost-in-the-shell-4k-release-director-mamoru-oshii-anime-making-of-art-style" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;has a great post&lt;/a&gt; on the efforts made to revitalize it for the 4K era. It supports Dolby Vision and has Atmos support, and in addition to the disc version, this package includes a digital copy. Also, the box art for the film is just incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JMLrzM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758328"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4hE4D"&gt;Normally $130, you can currently save a cool $30 on the compact Razer Huntsman TE at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tournament-Tenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07V25YPVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfA7Lbj8DI4#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. With this tenkeyless keyboard, Razer has scaled down the optical switches found on its Huntsman line and, as an added bonus, added PBT keycaps that are designed to resist unsightly grease and fingerprints. This keyboard is also the first Razer keyboard to adopt a standardized key size, allowing you to swap out custom keycaps with ease. A final quality of life improvement is the inclusion of a detachable USB-C connection, making it easier to swap out or customize. Unless you absolutely need a number pad, there’s little reason to overlook this keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KAPztR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yj_8WhMLiDN0YbdlvS_Tqqdzc24=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855433/Dell_G15_Press_Image_3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GlgSrT"&gt;Lastly, you still have time to get a great bargain on Dell’s latest G15 gaming laptop. Normally selling for a budget-friendly $1,029, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals091721/https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/afwj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it only costs $749&lt;/a&gt; for this configuration, including a 15.6-inch 1080p display that has a 120Hz refresh rate. What makes this laptop especially good, though, is its capable 11th-Gen Intel Core i5 processor, an Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics chip, and the fact that it has user-upgradeable RAM. This deal will last as long as there’s stock available at Dell,  and at the time of publishing Dell says it has sold 55 percent of available stock. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more about this model here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1ftsWr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10756456"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
