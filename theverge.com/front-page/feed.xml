    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHK0Tn"&gt;The hit social deduction game &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 sometime this year, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/29/grab-your-crew-among-us-drops-on-ps4-and-ps5-this-year/"&gt;Sony announced during its State of Play presentation on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRqU6M"&gt;Like on other platforms, the game will support crossplay and online multiplayer so that you can play with your friends no matter what platform you’re on. But PlayStation players will be the only ones who can get exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics: a skin and hat to dress up like Ratchet and a pet that is an adorable little Clank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PljCNx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWVHnP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; blew up last year on PC and mobile devices, eventually becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;, but the game didn’t debut on consoles until a surprise release on Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. Two days after, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;Microsoft confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the game would be hitting Xbox consoles sometime in 2021, and now, we know it’s on the way for PlayStation consoles, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeXKDj"&gt;Sony also showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22406719/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-state-of-play-sony-insomniac-games-playstation-5"&gt;16 minutes of stunning gameplay&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;during Thursday’s show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s widest plane nails ‘extremely successful’ second test flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbkYFGb_qGGOtP6cSrAqYVmVoU4=/0x56:2000x1389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208248/A9_08594_small.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stratolaunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwIUCN"&gt;Stratolaunch, the aerospace firm founded by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, flew its behemoth carrier airplane named ‘Roc’ on Thursday for a second time. It was the company’s first flight under new ownership, coming two years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/4/13/18309129/stratolaunch-worlds-biggest-airplane-first-flight-rockets"&gt;twin-fuselage craft’s initial flight test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5CG0P"&gt;“Today’s flight, at first review, has appeared extremely successful,” Stratolaunch’s chief operating officer Zachary Krevor told reporters in a call on Thursday. “We accomplished all test points as desired, we have not seen anything anomalous, and we are very pleased with the condition of the aircraft upon landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXiWVk"&gt;Roc’s wheels were up at 10:30AM ET, and the plane reached a peak altitude of 2.6 miles over the Mojave Desert in California, Stratolaunch wrote in a press release. The flight, powered by six engines, lasted three hours and 14 minutes before Roc touched down on a gigantic runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The flight lasted longer than its first outing in 2019, but the craft flew slightly lower. One side of the plane landed just before the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRoFmz"&gt;“The air crew did an excellent job of bringing the aircraft down according to our expected crosswind procedures,” Krevor said. Roc’s test flight was designed to see how the plane handles cabin pressurization, and test safety features and some new hardware upgrades since its last test flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NoExOS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Touchdown!! Successful flight tests to round out the day. What a beautiful sight. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gdssjvoN8x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gdssjvoN8x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stratolaunch (@Stratolaunch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stratolaunch/status/1387826410463531009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDLOdW"&gt;The carrier plane’s wingspan is 385 feet — nearly twice the width of a Boeing 747, making it the world’s largest aircraft by wingspan. It’s designed to eventually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;carry Stratolaunch’s fully reusable and autonomous Talon-A hypersonic vehicle — a rocket-powered, jet-shaped craft measuring 28 feet long and 14 feet wide that is designed to serve as a hypersonic testbed for the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZYolc"&gt;Once deployed, Talon A will ignite its liquid-fueled rocket engine to boost itself higher in Earth’s atmosphere for roughly a minute of hypersonic flight test conditions. It glides back for an autonomous landing on a conventional runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFnzmM"&gt;No such Talon-A was on board Roc for Thursday’s test flight, however. The company’s chief technology officer, Daniel Millman, told reporters that Roc will soar higher and faster in test flights over the next year until it can prove itself capable of hitting the right flight conditions required to drop Talon-A. “That will happen later in the year,” Millman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpZ9ra"&gt;Stratolaunch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189377/stratolaunch-scaling-back-operations-medium-launch-vehicle-rocket-layoffs-paul-allen-death"&gt;scaled back operations&lt;/a&gt;, laid off most of its employees and axed plans for a fleet of air-launched rockets following the death of its billionaire founder Paul Allen in October 2018. The company kept enough employees on board to manage the carrier aircraft’s debut flight, which occurred in April 2019. Stratolaunch went dark for more than a year after that. It eventually &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/exclusive-buyer-paul-allens-stratolaunch-space-venture-secretive-trump-ally/?fbclid=IwAR2tli4rU9aPZTnzSzR8gISWd12ovW2BD5_WzOKbtObKT1zgoXX9p2IFl38"&gt;found new funding&lt;/a&gt; and rehired some employees to revive its carrier plane test program and refocus its business on hypersonic testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9D4wV"&gt;Today’s flight of Roc, named after the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)"&gt;large and legendary&lt;/a&gt; bird of prey in Middle Eastern mythology, was the culmination of that revival. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon crosses $100 billion in sales in huge first quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxyr5eelCjz9Fbtfz2GbsJXsTqs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208089/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qz6lEP"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;had a wildly successful 2020&lt;/a&gt;, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and that blazing trail shows no signs of stopping for 2021. The company shared its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;financial results for Q1 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it brought in $108.5 billion in net sales. That’s a 44 percent increase from the $75.5 billion reported in the first quarter of last year, as the pandemic was beginning to take hold globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6DMDn"&gt;Its profits have exploded year-over-year, as well, increasing to $8.1 billion in the first quarter of this year. At this time in 2020, the figure reported was a &lt;em&gt;meager &lt;/em&gt;$2.5 billion. Amazon expects to continue crossing the $100 billion net sales mark next quarter with the figure ultimately landing somewhere between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR256L"&gt;But as Amazon’s sales have grown, it has also grown more concerned with government intervention. Its @AmazonNews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;made the bizarre decision to troll US Congress members&lt;/a&gt; about tax laws. The account also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;publicly disputed reports that some of Amazon’s workers pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; to meet company goals, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;then later apologized&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) for a tweet saying &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359"&gt;“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHl53X"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos shared his final annual letter to investors recently, highlighting the fact that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;Amazon Prime subscribers had grown to 200 million people&lt;/a&gt;, up approximately 33 percent from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115823/amazon-q4-19-earnings-prime-membership-fresh-one-day-shipping"&gt;its previous milestone of 150 million subscribers in Q4 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3aYrZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;Bezos will be replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; in Q3 2021, and he’ll be taking the reins of a seemingly unstoppable force that can turn huge sales and profit during tough times. He’ll also be taking on a swath of big issues that the company currently faces, notably unionization. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;a failed union vote&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;a fired worker is attempting to unionize other Amazon warehouse facilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart looks incredible in 16 minutes of new gameplay footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U5XUp9xrbnV056UMbzKT__4SUBo=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207968/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_2.22.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Insomniac Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WPNJ4"&gt;Sony and Insomniac Games debuted 16 minutes of stunning new &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; gameplay footage in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4Zf1GCFoqn0"&gt;a new State of Play presentation&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpMqUB"&gt;For part of the video, protagonist Ratchet traversed through a new town called Nefarious City that was packed with detail — it reminded me of a &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; version of Star Wars’ Coruscant. There was a lot of classic &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; gameplay on display, with 3D platforming and crates to smash for screws, but the developers have also added new moves to give you added mobility. There’s now dashing and wall running, for example, and you can also use the new Rift Tether to hook into portals so you can zip from place to place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8YRoCI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"A Lombax? What is this place?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Ratchet as he searches for clues in this extended look at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RatchetPS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RatchetPS5&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from State of Play: &lt;a href="https://t.co/sSGXRYz3fk"&gt;https://t.co/sSGXRYz3fk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OmaoVJcrrf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OmaoVJcrrf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1387882693728227331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrRPa"&gt;Another part of the video &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/26/meet-rivet-the-mysterious-new-protagonist-in-ratchet-clank-rift-apart/"&gt;starred Rivet&lt;/a&gt;, a new Lombax resistance fighter that lives in a different dimension than Ratchet and Clank’s. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1386787174964600834"&gt;She’s voiced by Jennifer Hale&lt;/a&gt;, known for her roles in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vj7M1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; will take advantage of the DualSense’s adaptive triggers to offer different actions for your guns based on how far you pull the trigger. Sony also showed off some new weapons, like the Shatterbomb, which launched grenade-like bombs at oncoming baddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKvpn"&gt;The game looks great, and fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to play it — &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; will be out on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUuSTL"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8hWEhS7iw0"&gt;State of Play show&lt;/a&gt;, Sony also revealed that &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/29/grab-your-crew-among-us-drops-on-ps4-and-ps5-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is hitting PS4 and PS5 in 2021&lt;/a&gt; and showed off new footage of &lt;em&gt;Subnautica: Below Zero, &lt;/em&gt;which launches on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google updates latest Chromecast with more HDR controls and improved Wi-Fi performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGnatIyUapoHAZ9CA0CzT_wxbJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207919/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCAl5U"&gt;Google is rolling out a new April update for the Chromecast with Google TV that launched last year. It’s a fairly large update for a streaming device — totaling 166MB on my Chromecast — but includes numerous improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npv13Q"&gt;Once you’ve installed the new software and restarted your Chromecast, you’ll be able to dig a little deeper into video settings than was previously possible. In the new “advanced video controls” area of settings, you’re now given the ability to choose your preferred dynamic range format. Options include Dolby Vision, HDR, or even SDR if you want to keep it there. You can also manually switch to a ton of resolutions at various refresh rates from this menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="36yUeg"&gt;4K (60Hz / 50Hz / 30Hz/ 25Hz / 24Hz / smpte)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t5QhTy"&gt;1080p (60Hz / 50Hz / 24Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Eo1bHR"&gt;720p (60Hz / 50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GaoEVx"&gt;1080i (60Hz / 50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FILvNX"&gt;576p (50Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ofU89h"&gt;480p (60Hz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="p8NXhg"&gt;Unless you’ve got a good reason to make a change, I’d keep it at whatever Chromecast selects as the default: that was 4K 60Hz in my case. Google says this update also improves the Chromecast with Google TV’s Wi-Fi performance on 5GHz networks and mesh systems. For the full list of improvements, see below. I’m still waiting for a way to clear the “continue watching” row, where shows and movies can sometimes just get stuck — even after you’ve finished streaming them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RlDCkK"&gt;- Advanced Video Controls setting for granular HDR formats, resolution/refresh rate, and color formats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgczXM"&gt;- HDMI hotplug improvements helping your Chromecast detect the best TV Settings available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoUsnh"&gt;- Wi-Fi Improvements for 5Ghz and Mesh networks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0A2MBj"&gt;- Bluetooth Audio stuttering improvements in some Apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFs42u"&gt;- HDMI-CEC can now be configured to turn on/off only the TV in settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBzt9I"&gt;- Security update: Android security patch level to April 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9xMkE"&gt;Separate from this software update, the Chromecast with Google TV also recently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/chromecast-with-google-tv-supports-hdr10-plus/"&gt;picked up certification for HDR10+&lt;/a&gt;. So if you come across content on Amazon Prime Video that streams in that format of HDR, it should soon be supported on Google’s streaming gadget.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Dexter creepily smile again in the first teaser trailer for his new Showtime series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WqFnzDC4zYyPNChba7z-AbMTjQ=/0x0:1293x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207812/dexter_screenshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NytOpQ"&gt;Years ago, my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues convinced me that &lt;em&gt;Dexter &lt;/em&gt;got so bad, it’d be a waste of my time to see my favorite TV serial killer reach the end of his story — so when I tell you that &lt;em&gt;Dexter&lt;/em&gt;’s coming back this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22410014/dexter-limited-series-showtime-teaser-misunderstood"&gt;picking up right where the show left off&lt;/a&gt;, I have&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;absolutely no clue what that actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWIh11"&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; emotionally invest yourself enough to see the series through, you have my pity, my respect, and a brand-new teaser trailer to watch, above, as proof of life — an assurance that the series’ widely panned ending isn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGzd8z"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Dexter&lt;/em&gt; will be a 10-episode limited series on Showtime this fall, starring Michael C. Hall, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dexter-revival-enlists-director-marcos-siega-exclusive"&gt;set 10 years after the original show&lt;/a&gt;, created by the original showrunner and featuring one of the original directors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOL4vr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The math isn’t adding up on forests and CO2 reductions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Upward view of giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park,..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13ml-ewiUPo2s9fS806Kmqrek1U=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207802/1042402326.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rU6eKQ"&gt;More evidence surfaced this week that shows that forests are struggling to do humans’ dirty work when it comes to climate change. Although companies and countries are increasingly relying on forests to draw down their planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, the math isn’t adding up to show big benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne6Rup"&gt;California might have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;oversold the success of carbon offsets used in its cap-and-trade system, which is often billed as one of the world’s most successful market-based mechanisms to tackle climate change. The system appears to be failing because California is actually overcounting how much carbon dioxide forests keep out of the atmosphere, according to a new &lt;a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets-explainer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by nonprofit CarbonPlan, that’s still under peer review, and reporting by &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-solution-actually-adding-millions-of-tons-of-co2-into-the-atmosphere"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (One of the authors, James Temple, was previously a senior director at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSnmbS"&gt;That finding follows research published earlier this week in the journal &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41558-021-01033-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F29%2F22410367%2Fforest-offsets-trees-carbon-dioxide-accounting" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found a giant discrepancy between how much climate pollution countries officially reported and how much pollution independent models calculated for them. In this case, forests mucked up the numbers because countries are attributing more carbon reductions to their forests than independent models do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vpt6Eb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That lets those polluters off the hook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S9xccC"&gt;Trees do provide a crucial service for people and the planet by “breathing in” and storing carbon dioxide. So protecting forests is important for their health and ours. But schemes devised to sell forests’ carbon storage to polluters as a way to cancel out their emissions haven’t always resulted in the CO2 reductions they’re supposed to achieve. Ultimately, that lets those polluters off the hook instead of pushing them to do more in the race to prevent a deeper climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycjZWZ"&gt;In the US, forest owners can sell their land’s ability to store carbon as “credits” to polluters. Since California sets a cap for how much CO2 pollution industries generate, companies can purchase those credits to cancel out some of their emissions and stay below the cap (with each credit representing one metric ton of CO2). But up to 39 million credits, nearly a third in the state’s program, didn’t actually provide the climate benefits they were supposed to, according to the new analysis by CarbonPlan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKS9Fj"&gt;That’s because the state was using averages to estimate how much CO2 each parcel of forest could hold. In reality, some pieces of forest can store more than others based on what kinds of trees are there and how dense the forest is. Forest managers also “gamed the system” by selling credits from parcels that inflated how much carbon they stored, &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NTF2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forest managers also “gamed the system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtJaIJ"&gt;The California Air Resources Board disputes the study’s findings, which are still undergoing peer review. “We were not given sufficient time to fully analyze an unpublished study and are not commenting further on the authors’ alternative methodology,” a spokesperson for the Air Resources Board wrote to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;. (This isn’t the first time California’s cap-and-trade system has come under scrutiny. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/how-california-can-make-its-cap-and-trade-program-more-equitable/"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that some “economically disadvantaged neighborhoods” near regulated facilities experienced higher rates of pollution after the carbon trading system began.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhjJ7J"&gt;Discrepancies in carbon accounting due to forests show up globally, too, according to the &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt; study. There was a 5.5 billion ton difference between the amount of carbon dioxide emissions nations report each year and what independent models calculated. That’s a big gap, nearly as much as the US’s net emissions in 2019. It boils down to the way the US and other countries count up carbon caught by their forests, which doesn’t match up with the methods other researchers use. The lack of standardized reporting across the board for countries and scientists could throw a wrench in global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. It’s hard to make progress if everyone’s taking different measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QytwC3"&gt;What’s more, countries that are big polluters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that have a lot of forests, like the US, can lean on that asset more than countries without as much forest cover, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/26/greenhouse-accounting-problem/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes. Countries like the US use forests to subtract emissions, and they end up reporting a smaller “net” footprint as a result. That can make it look like they’ve made bigger environmental gains even if they’re still polluting a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pigb1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A freebie from nature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DU9jZ9"&gt;If the US didn’t count on forests and other land ecosystems to offset some 12 percent of its emissions, its carbon footprint would actually be much higher. “We are lucky to have those natural carbon sinks,” Christopher Williams, a professor at Clark University, told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. “However, that carbon uptake is a freebie from nature for which we do not really get to take credit in our battle against climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dL3Hd"&gt;Despite the risks that come with relying on those freebies, it’s getting trendier than ever to invest in forest-based climate solutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932700/youtubers-climate-change-team-trees"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; have launched feel-good tree-planting initiatives. Tech companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that have made commitments to become carbon “neutral” or carbon “negative” say that they’ll draw down at least as many emissions as they release — and are relying heavily on trees to do that. But trees can only do so much — and, if the results of these studies hold up, perhaps much less than people previously thought they could. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds arrest founder of bitcoin ‘mixer’ they say laundered $335 million over ten years </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NUelXuDQ6sApIIlKUEp6Qa43lbY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207666/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="node-title"&gt;The Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/individual-arrested-and-charged-operating-notorious-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer"&gt;said it has arrested&lt;/a&gt; a Russian-Swedish national who allegedly operated a long-running cryptocurrency laundering site. According to a news release from the DOJ, Roman Sterlingov ran Bitcoin Fog, a cryptocurrency tumbler or “mixer”— which hides a cryptocurrency’s source by mixing it with other funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9kf0g"&gt;Bitcoin Fog gained “notoriety as a go-to money laundering service for criminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement,” according to the DOJ. The department says over the course of 10 years, Bitcoin Fog moved more than 1.2 million bitcoin, valued at the time of the transactions at around $335 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbJvTZ"&gt;Bitcoin Fog has received a fair amount of coverage from cryptocurrency blogs and news sites since its inception, with some &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-tumbler"&gt;recommending it&lt;/a&gt; as the best option for hiding the origin of bitcoin. The blockchain keeps track of bitcoin transactions, making services like Bitcoin Fog key for those looking to do business on the black market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYSe77"&gt;“The bulk of this cryptocurrency came from darknet marketplaces and was tied to illegal narcotics, computer fraud and abuse activities, and identity theft,” the DOJ said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDNEsV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.230456/gov.uscourts.dcd.230456.1.1_1.pdf"&gt;According to the IRS&lt;/a&gt;, the largest senders of bitcoin through Bitcoin Fog were “darknet markets, such as Agora, Silk Road 2.0, Silk Road, Evolution, and AlphaBay, that primarily trafficked in illegal narcotics and other illegal goods.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppgCyi"&gt;The IRS said it appeared from Bitcoin Fog transaction activity that Sterlingov took commissions of as much as $8 million on the bitcoin he helped clients launder. The current value of the Bitcoin Fog cluster — the large database of transactions — is about $70 million, the IRS said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFODN"&gt;Sterlingov is charged with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and money transmission without a license in the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi2EgH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m9MLj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dashlane’s new $3.99 password manager plan is cheaper but might not beat free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XOYYpCEhqawtU06Dmk1EnPbBlQ=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207636/Password_Changer.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dashlane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="korwDN"&gt;Dashlane has introduced a new $3.99 per month ($2.99 per month when charged yearly) &lt;a href="https://blog.dashlane.com/essentials-launch/"&gt;Essentials plan&lt;/a&gt; for its password manager that offers some of the most popular features from its $6.49 per month Premium plan at a more affordable price. But the lower price comes with a catch — you might not be able to access your passwords on as many devices as you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYPad7"&gt;Like Dashlane’s Premium plans, the new Essentials offers unlimited passwords, the ability to generate new passwords on the fly, autofill, and access to Dashlane’s Secure Notes feature for storing private text. You won’t have access to Premium features like dark web monitoring, Dashlane’s VPN, or, crucially, support for more than two devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVVQbS"&gt;That means you’ll have to pick where you access your passwords — likely your main computer and your phone — and potentially leave other devices out of the loop. It’s a similar limitation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333891/lastpass-free-changes-bitwarden-zoho-password-manager"&gt;to the changes LastPass made to its free plans&lt;/a&gt;, only LastPass locked you out of sharing passwords between mobile devices and desktops by limiting you to a single category. At $4 a month, Dashlane doesn’t quite have that issue. (If you want the full breakdown on how Dashlane’s plans compare, check out &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dashlane.com/plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the pricing guide on its site&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjTcZm"&gt;Limits on how many devices can access passwords are particularly frustrating when you consider some free password managers support unlimited devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;like our recent favorite, Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;. And Bitwarden doesn’t just remove the limit on devices — its free tier also allows for unlimited passwords, the ability to easily share them, and more. Dashlane has a free service, too, but it’s limited to only 50 passwords and can only be accessed on one device at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uLkfrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"},{"title":"Dashlane is giving its one-click password changer a big upgrade ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22320467/dashlane-one-click-password-changer-autofill-machine-learning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DVKhLn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 29th, 6:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added yearly price for Dashlane’s Essentials plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jvNQP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says old Magic Keyboard is ‘functionally compatible’ with new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but warns of imperfect fit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0X7eFBxQ5-anSfYUtk_1anrQrkY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69207327/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PSPjRS"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;upcoming 2021 refresh of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; — which will feature an M1 processor and a new Mini LED display — will work with the 2020 model of the 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard case after all. But it’s not going to be a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgnlQG"&gt;According to a newly added note to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211091"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswb/status/1387851740876210176"&gt;spotted by Chris Ball on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) the first-generation Magic Keyboard (model number A1998) will be “functionally compatible” with the updated iPad Pro. But due to the slightly thicker dimensions of the new 12.9-inch model (which is 0.5mm thicker than the 2020 version), Apple warns that “it’s possible that the Magic Keyboard may not precisely fit when closed, especially when screen protectors are applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76B5BMxsGY6bLgupRGvDvaONS6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22478941/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_3.37.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YOh2ca"&gt;Apple updated the document with clarification today (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210426043303/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211091"&gt;an earlier copy of the same document&lt;/a&gt; from last week does not contain the compatibility information). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; had reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro would not be compatible with the older case, but it appears Apple has decided it will narrowly work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6Qdix"&gt;While the old Magic Keyboard will still work, it seems that Apple is trying to encourage customers toward buying the new case, which presumably has more room to accommodate the thicker tablet. But given that the Magic Keyboard accessory for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $349, along with the relatively short time since its release, it’s easy to see why owners of the older model weren’t too excited about the prospect of having to shell out for a new accessory, especially when considering the $1,099 starting price of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPqMZH"&gt;All of this confusion only applies to the larger, 12.9-inch iPad Pro hardware, however. The 11-inch model (which isn’t getting a new Mini LED display and features identical measurements to the 2020 model) is still fully compatible with the 2020 version of its Magic Keyboard accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
