    <title>Facial recognition software used to verify unemployment recipients reportedly doesn’t work well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bwyt4x6JP1uBqJPnxa9BZG2rmM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69476410/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kkg1l6"&gt;The facial recognition program used by nearly two dozen US states to to verify people seeking unemployment benefits is working inconsistently, leading to many people being denied benefits or having their applications put on hold, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbywn/facial-recognition-failures-are-locking-people-out-of-unemployment-systems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbeLCb"&gt;The identity verification service ID.me is intended to help reduce unemployment fraud, and uses biometric data and official documents to verify people. But according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, some who have applied for unemployment have reported that ID.me has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(to%3Aidme)&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;failed to identify them&lt;/a&gt; correctly, and that they have had difficulty reaching someone at ID.me to remedy the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipu6K7"&gt;ID.me didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday, but the company’s CEO Blake Hall told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the algorithms the company uses in its Face Match technology have “99.9% efficacy.” He added that user error may be to blame, and said the company was not aware of “eligible individuals” who couldn’t verity their identity with its software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltIF1s"&gt;With millions of people unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic, state offices have dealt with a surge of claims over the past year. Some states reported a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-halts-unemployment-payments-for-two-days-after-finding-1-6-million-in-fraudulent-claims-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;sharp rise in fraudulent claims&lt;/a&gt; last spring, and the Department of Labor &lt;a href="https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/viewpdf.php?r=19-21-002-03-315&amp;amp;y=2021"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) in February that between March and October of last year it had identified more than $5 billion of potentially fraudulent unemployment payments. That’s far less than the $400 billion estimate Hall suggested to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; and other media outlets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to update its community standards to clarify what it considers satire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLqqKk1CBPUcd05hbDLZZOWJoAo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475706/acastro_180319_1777_facebook_data_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQvU4x"&gt;Following a recommendation from its Oversight Board, Facebook says it will update its community standards to be clearer about how it handles satirical content, the company said in &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/oversight-board-cases/comment-related-to-armenian-people-and-the-armenian-genocide/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOfpPR"&gt;“We’ll add information to the Community Standards that makes it clear where we consider satire as part of our assessment of context-specific decisions,” according to the post.  “This change will allow teams to consider satire when assessing potential Hate Speech violations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjsmOa"&gt;The update comes after the &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/288225579415246-announcing-the-board-s-next-cases-and-changes-to-our-bylaws/"&gt;Oversight Board determined&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook was wrong to remove a user’s comment with a reference to the Turkish government, based on the &lt;a href="https://memerino.me/two-buttons"&gt;two buttons meme&lt;/a&gt;. The Oversight Board described it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aUqNoi"&gt;This meme featured the same split-screen cartoon from the original meme, but with the cartoon character’s face substituted for a Turkish flag. The cartoon character has their right hand on their head and appears to be sweating. Above the cartoon character, in the other half of the split-screen, there are two red buttons with corresponding labels, in English: “The Armenian Genocide is a lie” and “The Armenians were terrorists who deserved it.” The meme was preceded and followed by “thinking face” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pjk1Bh"&gt;Facebook removed the post, citing its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/cruel_insensitive"&gt;Cruel and Insensitive Community Standard&lt;/a&gt;, which says it will remove posts that target “victims of serious physical or emotional harm,” which includes the use of memes and gifs. Facebook later reclassified the removal so it fell under its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech"&gt;Hate Speech Community Standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1Qn0d"&gt;The Oversight Board pointed out in its recommendation that while Facebook has said it will make exceptions for satire, it doesn’t specify how or what qualifies as satire in its guidelines. Facebook said in its post that in addition to making its guidelines around satire clearer, it would “initiate a review of identical content with parallel context,” and may take further action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao3guy"&gt;This marks the latest instance of Facebook following the guidance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;its fledgling Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month, Facebook said would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22474738/facebook-ending-political-figure-exemption-moderation-policy"&gt;end its so-called “newsworthiness” policy&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed politicians to skirt many of its content rules. Going forward the company “will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from content posted by anyone else,” Facebook’s Nick Clegg said in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/facebook-response-to-oversight-board-recommendations-trump/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The slow transitions of a lingering pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NYC has mark the end of the COVID-19 restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8veOUHyTHXNn4fNMqX0li5ZnWgk=/0x0:5341x3561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475596/1323971899.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYB7Un"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/michael-brown-europe-australia-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-78a0c659eccb7680ba6773bbdb8f01e8?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter"&gt;lifting in some places&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/16/covid-outbreaks-in-chinese-ports-could-cause-global-goods-shortages"&gt;outbreaks popping up in others&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic has officially entered the weird zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSzanL"&gt;Okay, there’s nothing official about it, but the entire world is in a strange transition time right now — and likely will be for a while. Unlike the jump-cut into the pandemic, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22364637/pandemic-edge-fear-hope-vaccines-surge-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;suspenseful vaccine ramp-up&lt;/a&gt;, this time is more hopeful, less frantic, but also stretched out in an uneven mess. Places, populations, and even industries are moving at different paces as they move back to some semblance of normality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1CtwS7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KmCpwC"&gt;It’s like the entire globe is playing by a perverse version of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and..."&gt;“yes, and.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, more people are vaccinated in the US than before, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;immunocompromised people are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/immunocompromised-covid-vaccine-unprotected-autoimmune-condition.html"&gt;still at risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Yes,&lt;/em&gt; the vaccines that we have are stunningly effective, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;they are in such short supply that many countries are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nepal-coronavirus-pandemic-health-1493a03ed4adb7be582d892b98efef76?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP"&gt;absolutely desperate to get them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIbH2b"&gt;Here in the US, one of the most visible transitions is the vanishing act of various COVID-19 regulations. New York lifted &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/nyregion/coronavirus-restrictions.html"&gt;most restrictions this week&lt;/a&gt;, and Disneyland reopened to everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/disneyland-is-now-open-for-everyone-how-to-get-tickets-and-park-reservations/"&gt;without mask requirements&lt;/a&gt;. People in those areas are enjoying a return to offices, and restaurants and blessed normalcy — especially in regions where case rates are low. At the same time, parts of the country where vaccination rates have stayed low face the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/world/us-south-covid-vaccine.html"&gt;potential of summer surges&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions between different regions will linger as long as disparities remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ryXh"&gt;In the pharmaceutical and research realm, there’s a different shift. The flurry of clinical trials and lab work that accompanied vaccine development is now slowing. There are still thousands of questions, but the biggest and most urgent — can we make a vaccine? — has been answered. Now, research focuses have shifted and split. Some are still working on vaccines and boosters, others are investigating new &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/health/covid-pill-antiviral.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;COVID-19 drugs&lt;/a&gt; or seeking to understand the virus’s origins and mechanics, and others have gone back to different projects entirely. With vaccines, the biggest issues are now monitoring and distribution, not research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EBMthj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;most people are stuck somewhere in the wide gap between caution and abandon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BCbZZD"&gt;How people feel about all of these changes is another factor entirely — personal shifts in priorities, fears, and emotions are going to play a huge role in this next phase of the pandemic. As vaccinations go up and case numbers go down, eventually, we’ll get used to the coronavirus, and it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;cease to be an unknown threat&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll stop thinking about it every day — some people already have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcoZHo"&gt;In the meantime, most people are stuck somewhere in the wide gap between caution and abandon. Each person will eventually move past their own personal marker for the pandemic era. It might come when they get that second shot or step into a theatre for the first time or leave a mask sitting on the table at home. As with all transitions, something will end, and something else will take its place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7HSXL"&gt;As a quick note before we get into what happened with COVID-19 this week, I also wanted to note that you might see some new (small) changes to this newsletter. Eventually, we’ll shift the newsletter over to a weekday instead of a Saturday. And starting next week, I’ll be handing over the reins to Nicole Wetsman, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s health reporter. She’s been filling in periodically, but I’m thrilled to have her writing to you more regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrP5mX"&gt;Some things won’t change, at least not yet. We’ll keep covering the pandemic and keep you up to date with what’s going on in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myGY4G"&gt;Thank you so much for joining us each week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hEoMyi"&gt;In the US, there’s more proof that vaccines are overwhelmingly effective. Doctors and health systems are increasingly reporting that the COVID-19 patients showing up for treatment are not vaccinated. (Elizabeth Weise and Aleszu Bajak/&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4uV0lG"&gt;A study published this week found that one reason for the horrifying disparities in COVID-19 deaths in the US might come down to a paucity of healthcare resources in hospitals that serve Black patients. (Stephanie M Lee/&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TrFqao"&gt;A different mRNA vaccine just tanked a clinical trial, only showing 47 percent efficacy against the virus. It’s a setback for the vaccine, which some hoped would help bolster the global supply. (Ludwig Burger/ &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9aFAk2"&gt;$3 billion has now been set aside to help researchers dig into a treatment for COVID-19. Instead of a vaccine, which prevents the virus from taking hold, a treatment would combat the disease when a person actually has it. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best pre-Prime Day deals for Father’s Day weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCR1disG9Y7Ooe85b5Y-oeyJmM4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475577/vpavic_042018_3979_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jyVmZW"&gt;Next week is when Prime Day 2021 begins. We’ll be here early on Monday and continue scouring deals through Tuesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535681/amazon-prime-day-tech-news-deals-date-time-2021"&gt;bringing you the best deals on the tech&lt;/a&gt; we know you’ll like. However, before that, on Sunday, is Father’s Day. If you’ve already gotten a gift for the dad in your life, hopefully you‘ll be able to celebrate together in some manner. But, if you haven’t yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"&gt;it’s never too late to get one through our thoughtfully-curated gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KV0Wut"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="05aw2d"&gt;Get $150 off Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h4HtK0"&gt;Best Buy is offering a rare discount on the Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (that fits even the latest M1-equipped version). Normally $349, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736544054881862306#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $199 for all of Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, it’s just the 11-inch model that sees a big discount. This keyboard has USB-C passthrough charging, it’s sturdy, and it has an excellent trackpad and keyboard. Keep in mind, though, that it’s going to add a good amount of weight and thickness while attached to your iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p3yolB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Z9q0SC"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acxOn1fPEghXkzEBxtcUdbY8R4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22667782/Philips_Hue_Bundle_Father_s_Day.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PmV4VD"&gt;Whether for Father’s Day or for yourself, Philips Hue is offering solid deals on two smart light bundles. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-3-pack-e26/046677562786" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first is a three-pack of standard E26 white and color ambiance bulbs for $100&lt;/a&gt; (usually $135). If you want to turn the color in your bathroom to blue and your living room to green, these are the bulbs for you. They’re Bluetooth-enabled, too, so you don’t need a Hue bridge accessory to use them, which is appealing. Though, if you want more instantaneous and seamless functionality, you may want to eventually get that Hue Bridge at some point — and these bulbs will work just fine with it once you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3wHAfk"&gt;The other Philips Hue deal is slightly more niche, but still good. If you buy Philips Hue’s Ligthstrip Plus V4 80-inch model for $80 (located at the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/promotions/fathersday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bottom of this page&lt;/a&gt;), the company will toss in a 40-inch extension at no extra cost. These two items would normally cost $105.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8GMm0i"&gt;
&lt;p id="aY1ro2"&gt;In case you haven’t already seen it in our deals coverage, Best Buy is offering the best prices on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous-gen iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; through Sunday, June 20th. If you have a free My Best Buy account, you can get $150 off most 11-inch and 12.9-inch configurations, whether you want a Wi-Fi or LTE-connected iPad. The base 11-inch model with 128GB of storage costs $600 — the same price as the iPad Air with half that amount of storage. The 256GB 11-inch model is just $100 more at $700. If you want a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 128GB base model costs $850.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PayPal raising merchant fees on some of its transactions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyjtyzmvnMwilkqXjc_vYxwlcRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475547/acastro_180410_1777_paypal_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qrf2vJ"&gt;PayPal said Friday it is raising fees for some of its newer products “to better align our pricing with the value that our products and services provide,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-18-Upcoming-Changes-for-Some-US-Businesses"&gt;according to a blog post &lt;/a&gt;by senior vice president Dan Leberman. The changes will affect how much PayPal merchants pay per transaction, and take effect August 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEqRKC"&gt;“PayPal has become more than just a button or payment processor to be a full commerce platform capable of driving growth for businesses,” according to the blog post. “Consumers are nearly three times more likely to complete their purchase when PayPal is available at checkout.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCE7Mg"&gt;In the past, PayPal has had a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/paypal-gains-after-announcing-price-increases-on-some-products"&gt;flat rate&lt;/a&gt; for sellers processing payments, charging 2.9 percent of a transaction price, plus a 30-cent fee. The new, higher rates will apply to the company’s newer products, like PayPal Checkout, and Pay with Venmo. According to its &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;first quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), PayPal has 392 million active accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uae7rK"&gt;Here’s how the new fee schedule breaks down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2QIQqP"&gt;For PayPal digital payments with its PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit, Pay in 4, PayPal Pay with Rewards, and Checkout with crypto, the new rate for online transactions will be 3.49 percent plus $0.491 per transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="krc04z"&gt;For in person payments with PayPal and Venmo QR code transactions over $10, the rate will be 1.90 percent plus 10 cents, and for transactions $10 and less, the rate will be 2.40 percent plus 5 cents. For certain in-person debit and credit transactions the rate will be 2.29 percent plus 9 cents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HeuVRz"&gt;The rate for online credit and debit card transactions will be 2.59 percent plus $0.491 per transaction without its chargeback protection, and with chargeback protection the rate will be 2.99 percent plus 49 cents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Bq8Qr"&gt;The fee for charity transactions will be 1.99 percent plus 49 cents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="beLM1i"&gt;For US merchants who have custom, non-standard pricing, rates will remain unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0jEpMM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRuOec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="square-stripe"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lpEiZv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKPbcz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Mothersbaugh on composing music you won’t tire of in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="34th Annual BMI Film, TV &amp;amp;amp; Visual Media Awards - Red Carpet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QH9d0YC5vwBqwru5NOG2ZFXuCDo=/0x622:3114x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475441/956744398.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Frazer Harrison / Getty Images for BMI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UYtS3U"&gt;If you’ve spent some time playing &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, you might feel like you’re playing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;a blockbuster family-friendly action movie&lt;/a&gt; — and that’s not just because of the game’s many perfectly timed set pieces. &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is also backed by a sweeping score composed by the legendary musician Mark Mothersbaugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6JITq"&gt;You might recognize Mothersbaugh as the co-founder of the band Devo or as the composer of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMEj9kQg3F8"&gt;Nickelodeon’s &lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But I suggest you also scroll through his &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006205/"&gt;IMDb page&lt;/a&gt;. He’s been a jaw-droppingly prolific composer with work stretching back to the 1980s, and he has credits on films (&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;), TV series (&lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows, Dawson’s Creek&lt;/em&gt;), and even other video games (&lt;em&gt;Skate 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ngNDF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something you want to listen to for God knows how many hours”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FY9mCK"&gt;I recently had a chance to talk to him about his involvement with &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; and what it’s like for him to compose a video game. One key aspect, he says, is that music in a game has to be “something you want to listen to for God knows how many hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fb5b6g"&gt;That makes sense — you might hear a song over and over again as you’re exploring a level or world, and games can often last dozens of hours. “It has to be something that, if you go away and you hear it in your head, you enjoy that, and it’s not something that’s irritating,” he says. “Because if a piece of music is inferior or not great, and you listen to it long enough, you can get really pissed off at everything, including the game that you were hearing it in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDsfek"&gt;I’m only a few hours into &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, but so far, I’d say Mothersbaugh succeeded in making the music enjoyable to listen to over and over again. Take &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55PRv_e00wc&amp;amp;t=85s"&gt;the game’s main theme&lt;/a&gt;: the expansive orchestral anthem wouldn’t feel out of place in the latest &lt;em&gt;Marvel&lt;/em&gt; epic, and I haven’t tired of hearing it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5i6ggH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/55PRv_e00wc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="clfVMe"&gt;The decision to use a full orchestra for the score was intentional, Mothersbaugh says, as it acted as a “glue” to keep the game’s universe feeling cohesive. Throughout the soundtrack, though, he and the audio team added electronic elements and certain melodies to give different areas and planets unique identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz9FVN"&gt;I’m currently working through a mining-themed world, for example, and there’s a lot of heavy percussion to evoke the sounds of an active mine. But when I hop into one of the game’s special “pocket dimensions,” which are optional puzzle platformer rooms (kind of like the FLUDD-less levels in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;), the music takes on a more ethereal tone as I jump on disappearing platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsEEBd"&gt;Mothersbaugh also has to think about game music differently because of the interactivity of the medium, as opposed to a static film. “You’re always gonna see that film in one shape or one size,” he explains. Video games, on the other hand, can be “plastic and amoebic and alive.” And as a result, the music is “intimate to each person because it’s developing with them, and they’re part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OTNNln"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like an insight into your world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMZCnp"&gt;Mothersbaugh’s music doesn’t just add color to a world the player is exploring, though. He says the way music builds in a video game can reflect how it takes shape in his own head. “When you start level one — boom — the game starts, and you’re hearing the very first pass on a piece of music,” he says. As the characters advance through the levels and improve their abilities, the sounds get more layered and complex. This is meant to mirror a composer discovering and improving on their music. “It’s kind of like an insight into your world,” Mothersbaugh says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQT3X4"&gt;This concept of music you can listen to repeatedly is particularly challenging for Mothersbaugh, who has a low tolerance for music that he doesn’t like. “If I listen to something I wrote, and an hour later, I can’t stand it anymore, then I’m kinda like, ‘You know what? This doesn’t deserve to be anywhere.’” A day before our interview, he happened to hear the soundtrack again at a listening party. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is good. This is a strong score,’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ8Ojz"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the PS5. If you want to hear the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; soundtrack for yourself, it’s available &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundtracks.lnk.to/riftapart"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;on many streaming services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google may be working on an answer to Apple’s device-locating network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbU2R9IW9GFFQYRAXRg3kgUCQNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473709/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BED5OO"&gt;Google may be working on turning Android phones into a hivemind capable of finding lost devices, similar to Apple’s Find My network, according to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/18/google-spot-find-my-device-network/"&gt;analysis done by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; A toggle for the feature showed up in a beta of Google Play Services, with code referencing the ability for phones to help locate other devices, potentially signaling that Android phones could soon become easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4By43u"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the current Find My Device system can only find phones that are powered on, have a data or Wi-Fi signal, and have location services enabled. At this early stage, it’s unclear which, if any, of those limitations the relay network feature — apparently called Spot — would solve, but when you’re looking for a lost phone any advantage is good to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s26PeV"&gt;Google has other projects that involve using a network of Android phones — notably, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;earthquake detection feature&lt;/a&gt;. While the implementation is different, the underlying concept is likely very similar: there are more than 3 billion active Android devices, which is a large crowd to source information from, be it accelerometer data, or the location of a misplaced phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq0bvA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; did find a setting that would allow users to turn off the feature, making it so their phone wouldn’t help locate other devices. Given the limited information, it’s unclear whether the Find My Device network will be able to find things other than phones, like Apple’s Find My network or Samsung’s Galaxy Find network are capable of doing. And of course, this being unpacked code from a Beta release, these changes may never see an actual public release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZQdt3"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to request for comment about the prospective feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will bring picture-in-picture to iPhones and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTbV4Gq3GYbLqq25Wm1LBY-4ckM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473425/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rpYADg"&gt;The YouTube app on iOS &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/youtube-pip-support-rolling-out/"&gt;will be getting picture-in-picture support&lt;/a&gt;, allowing all users to watch videos while doing other things on their iPhones and iPads. A YouTube spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the feature is currently rolling out to Premium subscribers, and that a launch for all iOS users (including the free ones) in the US is in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqNyOh"&gt;Apple added support for picture-in-picture video for iPads with iOS 9, and brought it to iPhones with iOS 14. Since then, YouTube’s support for the feature on iPhones and iPads has been spotty — it works for iPad if you’re using Safari (though some have reported it doesn’t work &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252090452"&gt;for non-Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;); iPhone users have only been able to access the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9bg8b"&gt;That complication seems to be going away, at least for those in the US: iOS users, with or without a YouTube Premium subscription, will soon have access to it using the YouTube app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7552722"&gt;as Android users have for years&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube did not provide a timeline for when the feature would arrive for free users, but stated the rollout to Premium subscribes is in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4D2RE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article stated that PiP video came to the iPad with iOS 13. It in fact arrived with iOS 9. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We may have our first look at Ring’s Car Cam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IalUdbZ8NMSRrTZhYVATaYal06c=/0x12:592x407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69473055/ring_car_cam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-06/rings-car-cam/" target="_blank"&gt;ZatzNotFunny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i45kax"&gt;We may have gotten our first look at Ring’s dashcam, &lt;a href="https://thetapedrive.com/amazon-plans-to-release-a-suite-of-ring-product-including-amazon-fetch-ring-auto-and-this-strange-looking-jaws-camera"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;The Tape Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which posted an image of a Ring-branded camera that looks like it’s made to fit on a car’s dashboard. Based on a support article which &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-06/rings-car-cam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zats Not Funny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered (and claims may have been published inadvertently) Ring’s Car Cam will have Alexa integration and the ability to start recording if you tell it you’ve been pulled over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kQGvm"&gt;The Car Cam was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;announced by the Amazon-owned company&lt;/a&gt; in September as a dashboard-mounted device which would record both the inside and outside of the vehicle, and was priced at $199. However, the &lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049596812-Ring-Car-Cam-Information"&gt;support article about the Car Cam&lt;/a&gt; that’s been posted on Ring’s site says that the camera attaches to the windshield as well. The design, as depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Tape Drive&lt;/em&gt;’s findings does seem like it could allow for that, if it comes apart into two pieces or extends. We’ll likely have to wait for an official announcement to get a good idea of how it works (and to see if this is actually an image of the Car Cam at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VotXVP"&gt;The support article confirms many of the features that were teased when Amazon announced the Car Cam last September, but reveals several new ones as well. It states that the camera will plug into your car’s OBD-II port, and that a subscription service isn’t required for the camera, as it saves videos locally, which you can access via Wi-Fi and the Ring app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dltIqs4jJ9PeUvgGJJ5LIYoNcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21905990/20200921_image_blog_car_cam_desktop_2x_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s announcement of the Car Cam included a picture of the Ring app showing footage from it, but not one of the device itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hANrMd"&gt;However, the document does say that some advanced features will require an optional Ring connectivity plan. The page doesn’t have a list of the features that will and won’t work without cellular connectivity, but it does say that LTE is required for the Emergency Crash Assist feature, where the camera will sense a car accident and have a Ring agent check on the driver and call 911 if needed. The article also says that cellular connectivity is required for saving videos to the cloud when the car is out and about, which could be helpful in the event that the car is stolen. According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;the initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; last year, the device will also hook into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; for connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgTzLv"&gt;There still isn’t any solid information about when the camera will be released, although Ring did say it would be some time this year. The support article, however, notes that the device hasn’t been cleared by the FCC yet, and won’t be available for sale until it is. We’ve reached out to Amazon for additional information on the Car Cam and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get a Tesla Model S Plaid to go from 0 to 60 in under 2 seconds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tr5npM1RNpc7R-gPpUthy3YXAQ=/112x0:1441x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69472545/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.51.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQSaBj"&gt;Tesla’s been talking up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527645/tesla-model-s-plaid-event-watch-how-to-start-time"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt; as “the quickest production car ever” claiming it can go from 0-60 in a blistering 1.99 seconds. It’s a claim that’s drawn a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yigpPSu_o"&gt;lot of raised eyebrows&lt;/a&gt; from car enthusiasts and experts. Can it &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;go that fast? Turns out, it can. But only under some incredibly specific Tesla-dictated conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H2ldH"&gt;That’s what &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;found when it got an exclusive chance to test out the Model S Plaid. Instead of letting the publication put the car through its paces on its usual test track, Tesla’s PR insisted that their drivers use a specific test track, and drive that track in a particular way. Under Tesla’s conditions, &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;went 0-60 in 1.98 seconds, running a quarter-mile in just 9.25 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJvAi"&gt;The entire review is &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2021/2022-tesla-model-s-plaid-first-test-review/"&gt;definitely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. But a key takeaway is that apparently, in order to hit that sub-two-second acceleration record, you’ll need the following ingredients: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="0QocHI"&gt; Find a dragstrip that’s willing to let you drive your Model S Plaid. This may be difficult, &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend &lt;/em&gt;points out, as most dragstrips will insist on following NHRA regulations that call for speedy cars like this have added safety features like a roll cage and window safety net. Tesla won’t be offering those features, &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CasCGg"&gt;If you do find a track willing to let you test your shiny new car’s zoom capability, make sure it has a surface prepped with a &lt;a href="https://fansided.com/2017/04/24/nascar-what-is-vht-bristol-motor-speedway/"&gt;grippy resin&lt;/a&gt; that will help the car launch even more quickly. Regular asphalt simply will &lt;em&gt;not do. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uN2pzY"&gt;Allow plenty of time if you want to go fast. You’re going to want to tell the car to switch into Drag Strip mode. The car will start prepping itself for the gauntlet you’re going to put it through. According to &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend: &lt;/em&gt;“Over the next eight to 15 minutes (the time needed varies), the car preconditions the powertrain for hard acceleration, heating or cooling the battery as needed and chilling the motors.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4iRIb"&gt;Once you’ve got Drag Strip engaged, you’re ready to...wait a little longer. Just a few more seconds this time! Hit the brake, hit the acceleration, let the car drop into a “cheetah stance” over 9 seconds. Just like a sprinter, it needs time to prep itself on the block. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sExUui"&gt;Ok, now go fast. Real fast. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="sXOTiS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
