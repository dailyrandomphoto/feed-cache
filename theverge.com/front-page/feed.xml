  &lt;p id="wYNLM6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; presents a second edition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21432189/making-it-work"&gt;Making It Work&lt;/a&gt;, a special issue about how small businesses and creators have found clever and creative ways to adapt to the current climate and get paid. Whether it’s taking farmers markets online, becoming a tour guide on TikTok, or moving bike part sales from Amazon to the real world, these are stories about how the internet has enabled scrappy underdogs and thoughtful problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine gets full FDA approval  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccine Mandates For Kids Is Next Big Back-To-School Fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htBgOtKfd6Ox0dLJnnT04Ic-OHo=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763296/1234462203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6zBmZ"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;granted full approval&lt;/a&gt; to the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, another landmark in the historic immunization campaign. The vaccine was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; to people over the age of 12 in the United States under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization.&lt;/a&gt; Now, it’s officially licensed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KGpd"&gt;With full approval, Pfizer and BioNTech can directly market the shot to consumers. The vaccine will be marketed under the name Comirnaty to people over 16. It will still be available to people 12-15 years old under an emergency use authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSeH0j"&gt;“The FDA’s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. “While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XacCgw"&gt;The approval may also push more companies and schools to mandate vaccinations. While it’s legal for them to require vaccinations under an emergency authorization, some have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/us/colleges-vaccinations-enrollment.html"&gt;been reluctant&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Public health officials hope that full approval may push more people to get vaccinated. “Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.” Woodcock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI86vD"&gt;The companies needed to provide six months of safety and efficacy data on their vaccine to the FDA in order to submit their application for what’s called a Biological License. The agency only asked companies to collect &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download"&gt;two months&lt;/a&gt; of data before applying for an emergency use authorization. The shortened timeline allowed the agency to sidestep some of the more lengthy regulatory steps and get vaccines to people quickly during the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Baol4h"&gt;FDA approval may help some people who were on the fence about getting vaccinated feel more comfortable taking the shot. One &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-may-2021/"&gt;May survey&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of unvaccinated adults would be more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine that was fully approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0ccM0"&gt;Now that one COVID-19 vaccine has full approval, other pharmaceutical companies will not be able to ask the FDA for new emergency use authorizations. Emergency authorizations can only be issued for drugs or vaccines when there are no approved options available — now that the Pfizer / BioNTech shot is licensed, that’s no longer the case. If AstraZeneca, for example, wanted to make its shot available in the US, it would have to start with the longer formal approval process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNExtg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxWquB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s QC35 II wireless headphones are $100 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QC35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_W2a0myee91gszcuQyY_CIjmssE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763269/bose1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDaTXS"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, often referred to in shorthand as the QC35 II, are just about the cheapest they’ve ever sold for today. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbose-quietcomfort-wireless-headphones-12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has new, black-colored units with a one-year Bose warranty for $195&lt;/a&gt;. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is $5 cheaper than the previous best price on record. These aren’t the latest noise-canceling headphones to hit the market. They released in late 2017, and the reasons they’re still popular are because of their solid sound quality, comfort, a dedicated voice assistant button, and an effective noise cancellation effect. One thing you might not like about them, though, is that they recharge via a Micro USB port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3uzUI"&gt;A new set of Bose headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;appeared in an FCC filing recently&lt;/a&gt;, a possible hint that the QC45s might be releasing sooner than later. They’ll almost certainly be an improvement in many ways over the QC35 II, but they’ll likely be much pricier than today’s deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVLwxG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLVp3v"&gt;Apple’s clear case for the iPhone XR is, frankly, a terrible value for the $40 or so that the company usually charges for it. So, if you have an iPhone XR and want a durable case with simple styling, I’m encouraging you to instead &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749902636215052284" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consider Best Buy’s deal&lt;/a&gt; on the case. It’s going for just $14, so you could even buy two of them, in case one should degrade over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pU1IHH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10714816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rY20hi"&gt;It wasn’t too long ago when finding a webcam selling for a reasonable rate was out of the question. If you want a basic webcam that offers 720p resolution at 30 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C505-Webcam-720p-Long-Range/dp/B08BNJPVXG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s C505 is selling for its lowest price today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, costing $40 instead of $55. Given these specs, don’t expect remarkable fidelity, but it should be good enough if you just need an affordable webcam for jumping into some face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sQJGgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10714827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9n9NRd"&gt;Last week, we featured a $100 off deal on Apple’s latest iPad Mini from 2019. Your chances of finding that deal increased over the weekend, as Best Buy started honoring this deal. You can get $100 off each model, whether it’s limited to Wi-Fi or you want an LTE-enabled model. The price starts at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903282026194249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903296052984453" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$430 for the 64GB LTE version&lt;/a&gt;. Does this recent price drop mean that a new iPad Mini is around the corner? I wish that we knew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AqXdb6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p6R8mq"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;

With the cost for one router set to $91, getting three of them for $150 is a great value.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop is out on November 19th, check out the first photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgFUz-he_z5NTUp1rnsMIJcEi58=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763061/COWBOYBEB_Unit_07433RC2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLywiT"&gt;Four years after news broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745990/cowboy-bebop-live-action-series"&gt;that work had begun on a live-action adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of beloved sci-fi anime &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, the series finally has a release date. Netflix announced today that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; will come in for a landing on November 19th, and here are some new photos to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F05jUt"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115752/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-series-announced"&gt;Netflix confirmed it was working on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the streaming service has been decidedly tight-lipped on details. It announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295535/netflix-cowboy-bebop-john-cho-spike-live-action-series"&gt;the show’s cast in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and, earlier this year, that original composer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;Yoko Kanno would return to the live-action series&lt;/a&gt;. But there still hasn’t been an official trailer or a casting announcement for series regular “Radical Edward.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UxZspCFTomOAQCEs4dL3LQAlrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22796080/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mLyON"&gt;Now at least Netflix is sharing photos of the cast — John Cho as Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine — featuring what look to be final costumes and sets for the series. You can see a few choice selections above, along with a whole gallery below. Feel free to pair them with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hj6hPqKiS4"&gt;Kanno’s score from the original series&lt;/a&gt; for the full effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its Partner Program now has 2 million members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5HvgfuCsMLkbcs_IeRH5uM-oek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763043/acastro_200123_3880_Youtube_NDA_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program has passed the 2 million creator mark | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGOdvM"&gt;YouTube’s Partner Program, which allows users to make money off their videos, has passed the 2 million creator mark, the company said Monday. The platform has helped turn YouTube into a viable business for top creators like PewDiePie and Jenna Marbles, but it’s also been the cause of consternation for the company when eligible partners — often those same top creators — do something that reflects poorly on the platform and temporarily drives away advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqHByb"&gt;Creators who qualify for the Partner Program — you need at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of overall watch time on your channel in the past 12 months — can earn money through ads, subscription fees, donations, livestreaming, and YouTube Premium revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daTupU"&gt;The Google-owned company has struggled at times to find the balance between having a lot of creators who rake in ad revenue and keeping advertisers happy. This has included deciding when to remove ads from channels that engage in harassment or other problematic content; while YouTube takes a cut of eligible creators’ ad revenue, if advertisers are wary of a channel’s content, they’ll pull their ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VExuM"&gt;YouTube updated its harassment policy in 2019 in response to some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754620/youtube-commentary-harassment-creators-bullying-susan-wojcicki"&gt;creator-on-creator harassment&lt;/a&gt;, which was a significant corner of the site for years, and has punished creators who cross legal or ethical lines by demonetizing their channels. In the past year, that’s included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164553/youtube-coronavirus-demonetization-sensitive-subjects-advertising-guidelines-revenue"&gt;demonetizing videos&lt;/a&gt; that mention the coronavirus, considered a sensitive topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0h5NP"&gt;Neal Mohan, chief product officer at YouTube, said in a blog post that the number of new channels joining the program in 2020 more than doubled when compared to 2019, and the number of YouTube channels making six figures or more in revenue is up 35 percent year over year (but he didn’t provide the specific number of creators who make that much money). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLHBx5"&gt;“Finding new ways to reward trusted creators financially and help them ramp up their businesses will always be a top priority for us,” Mohan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knY9Jo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As demand for bikes surged, Amazon got in the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqyygfPBIs88MRZrMe30TolbNAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763054/VRG_ILLO_4687_Amazon_Bikes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A bike parts company ditched Amazon to support indie shops instead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hCWaUa"&gt;After leaving his job in global business development at Amazon, Aaron Kerson used his knowledge of the platform’s sales algorithms to power up his new business. Pacific Northwest Components, launched in 2017 with his wife Emily, slowly became a success, selling handlebars, levers, and other mountain bike parts. But when the pandemic hit and a global shortage battered the bike industry, Kerson realized one company was causing a lot of problems: Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJwgmV"&gt;Now Kerson’s company is part of a slew of businesses turning their backs on Amazon and removing their products from the platform’s marketplace. In the last two years, brands like &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/01/22/why-nike-cut-ties-with-amazon-and-what-it-means-for-other-retailers/?sh=184a5d5f64ff"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, Ikea, and Birkenstock have pulled their merchandise, citing frustration with business practices, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/birkenstock-quits-amazon-in-us-after-counterfeit-surge.html"&gt;counterfeit products&lt;/a&gt;, and lack of access to customer data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T5Sp61"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It would mean that 20-30 percent of PNW’s sales would disappear overnight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJuov0"&gt;“Is this worth it?” Kerson kept asking himself as he decided how much of PNW’s limited stock to list on Amazon. The responsibility of running a small business had been getting to him: “The multitude of scariness just keeps getting bigger.” But he had to change something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwXFbJ"&gt;In June, Kerson removed all of PNW Components’ products from Amazon. He wanted to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnwcomponents.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fpnw-components-pauses-business-on-amazon&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22618306%2Fpacific-northwest-components-bike-company-quit-amazon-support-indie-shops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reallocate the inventory&lt;/a&gt; to independent bike shops in an effort to save an industry shell-shocked by the effects of the pandemic. It would mean that 20-30 percent of PNW’s sales would disappear overnight. But there were upsides to leaving Amazon, too; PNW would regain direct control of customer service and returns, much of which was ceded to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avF0jp"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic affected supply chains everywhere. By the end of March 2020, there was a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/29/21267958/bikes-supply-chain-bicycle-memorial-day-weekend"&gt;global shortage&lt;/a&gt; of bikes and bike parts, while demand surged. Most bike manufacturing is based in Asia, and as the pandemic wore on, PNW parts that used to take 45 days to ship from Taiwan took up to 200 days to arrive. By the start of 2021, Kerson heard of bike shops on the brink of closing down due to such high demand and low inventory. Pulling his products from Amazon, he thought, could help those independent bike shops — and rid PNW of an ongoing frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifmRKG"&gt;Amazon had been posing serious customer service problems for PNW.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Shopping for bike parts is complex, Kerson says, because choosing the right item depends on specifics about the customer and their bike. Amazon offers no way to provide that kind of expertise, so the rate of returns is high. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Part of the website shows the categories of gear they offer, including dropper posts, levers, and parts of gravel bikes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23KfyWuLC4APGrSIgrbgkrlVK08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773485/pnwcomponentswebsite.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Northwest Components moved its bike parts sales off Amazon and to independent bike stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="28WaQz"&gt;Return fraud was a constant issue for PNW, too. Kerson says he had hundreds of fake items returned to him via Amazon. He’s opened boxes containing steel pipes, a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker, a high-end faucet, and once, a child’s Superman costume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2Y8I5"&gt;Another headache was maintaining participation in Seller Fulfilled Prime, an Amazon program where sellers ship products directly on a speedy timeline, rather than using Amazon’s warehouses. The pace was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="97VBgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only reason they were on Amazon was because they had to be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUcJF3"&gt;“You need to ship out products the same day. You have to do that at a 99 percent success rate. You can’t have too many returns,” says Andrew Marshall, who handles PNW’s operations and finance. PNW ended up selling some products where more than half the sale price went to shipping, even before Amazon had taken its commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjprVc"&gt;“For anyone who is a small or medium-sized business, it’s physically impossible, or unprofitable, to be doing all-week nationwide delivery,’ says Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse. “Amazon has effectively killed Seller-Fulfilled Prime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4rDwc"&gt;The alternative is to use Amazon’s in-house service, Fulfilled By Amazon. But that requires small businesses to cede control, selling wholesale to the company or using Amazon’s fulfillment centers and delivery systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9dC7L"&gt;PNW wasn’t the only business growing tired of Amazon.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kerson and his team asked buyers at every retailer who stocks PNW parts to remove them from their Amazon stores too, so that everyone involved could maximize their profits and not undercut each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mDYlmz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other sellers have run into similar frustrations with Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhSGsO"&gt;“We set up these calls and we were not expecting them to go very well,” says Marshall, “As soon as we started talking about it the buyers were really excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpmZQJ"&gt;Turns out, Amazon wasn’t working for these bigger bike retailers either. “The only reason they were on Amazon was because they had to be, to compete to sell that product,” says Marshall, “They were also losing money on low-dollar items, but they were taking the hit just to get a chance to connect with that customer.” Some sellers were putting slips of paper in with low-value items, asking customers to buy directly from the store next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jz1Ar"&gt;Unlike struggling bike shops, Amazon’s profits skyrocketed during the pandemic. The company’s annual revenue &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx"&gt;hit $386 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, up 38 percent from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f04clb"&gt;These problems aren’t unique to the bike industry. Kerson is part of a growing movement of small-scale sellers frustrated with Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge5CeQ"&gt;Sarah Ford, a former US Marine, pulled her Texas-based luxury boot brand, Ranch Road Boots, off Amazon in 2019. “I looked at Amazon as the world’s biggest mall. And I just wanted to get my boots on as many people’s feet as possible,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgrDbZ"&gt;Ford quickly faced challenges after starting on Amazon in 2016. She had underestimated the additional costs of succeeding on the platform, like buying paid advertising to ensure customers found her products. This was on top of the commission Amazon took on every sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lxBKl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have zero regrets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7Tk0S"&gt;Amazon accounted for 50 percent of Ford’s sales when she pulled her boots from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAvsdn"&gt;“It took a couple of years to get that revenue back on our side. But I have zero regrets,” Ford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru3wfR"&gt;Kerson and Marshall hope PNW will be in a similar position soon. However, as Marshall points out, PNW could only make the decision to leave Amazon because they’d grown their business there in the first place. For small businesses just starting out, ignoring the platform might not be an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJJKf0"&gt;“A lot of the smaller brands are really forced into using Amazon,” says Marshall. “If they want to grow their brand, there’s really not any alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVdrL5"&gt;Since they left Amazon, PNW’s returns have already dropped, Kerson says, and sales from their website have increased. They’re selling fewer low-dollar items, but they’re optimistic they will regain lost revenue. More bike shops have asked to stock their items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aASEv7"&gt;Kerson doesn’t shop on Amazon himself anymore. But from the windows of his house in Seattle, he can see their delivery vans coming and going, all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supercell’s next game is all about co-operation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jayQus0oXQiV968FSc9Tqlli_LA=/71x0:830x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762844/Everdale_Splash_Alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fBxKul"&gt;Supercell, the Finnish developer best-known for mobile hits like &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;, announced its next game today — and it looks to be a big departure. Called Everdale, it’s described as “a peaceful building game based on cooperation and friendship.” There are plenty of mobile games about building towns or villages, but &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt;’s hook is that you’ll do that alongside other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEhsiD"&gt;Here’s the basic set-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kegaKr"&gt;Your village is actually part of a larger valley, where you and nine other players work together to build a big, wondrous utopia. In the valley, you’ll meet an eclectic cast of characters, make handcrafted goods, and trade with merchants from far off lands. More still, you can jump into local adventures, and level up your villagers at the esteemed valley guilds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="l1x6bq"&gt;For the most part, Supercell’s previous games have been centered on conflict, where that’s the fantasy card battles of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093052/supercell-brawl-stars-global-launch-iphone-android"&gt;the squad-based shooting in &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The peaceful tone of Everdale feels like a notable departure, and it’s also set in a brand-new universe. (Supercell has steadily been expanding the &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; franchise with new games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362092/supercell-clash-of-clans-clash-royale-new-games"&gt;including three new titles currently in development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21430993/clash-of-clans-royale-animated-short-youtube-supercell"&gt;an animated short&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBgBNF"&gt;You can check out &lt;em&gt;Everdale&lt;/em&gt; for yourself today depending on where you’re based — the game is going into soft launch in a handful of countries, including Canada, the UK, Nordics, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The farmers market is moving online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7S9mpu_gL5egKp7N7jZs6FugaE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69762774/VRG_ILLO_4687_Farmers_Markets.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought rampant growth for local food distribution platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zQpINo"&gt;For the past two decades at Crystal Organic Farm in Newborn, Georgia, a typical Saturday morning involved Nicolas Donck and, later, his partner in farming and in life, Jeni Jarrard, getting up at 4AM, loading up the truck with tables and tent and coolers and bins of eggs, peppers, okra, melons, herbs, flowers, or whatever was good that week, driving the hour to Atlanta, and spending a day in whatever weather — including sweltering heat, pouring rain, or bitter cold — before hauling the hour back, happy from feeding their community the food they spent all week growing, but also exhausted, and just a few hundred bucks richer for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUpX47"&gt;Then the pandemic came, and it hit farms hard. Supply chains, customer bases, and in some cases labor were upended. Small and medium-sized independent farms that relied on restaurant wholesale lost &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Biiu9JmAZY"&gt;huge percentages of their business&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Some local CSAs folded. Some farming operations &lt;a href="https://www.harvie.farm/blog/changes-in-the-local-food-market-2020-edition/"&gt;went belly up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRi5ME"&gt;Others, however, found a new path online. Farmer-specific e-commerce apps and services — among them, GrazeCart, Farmdrop, Farmigo, and GrownBy — have cropped up in recent years, offering the direct-to-consumer sales, customizable CSAs, preorders and delivery that farmers markets haven’t. When the pandemic began, this tech offered a new world of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HonAb7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Business is booming for food distribution platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCdhem"&gt;Donck and Jarrard were among the farmers who took the leap. When food distribution chains collapsed and people turned to local food, the pair made the snap decision to eliminate their old-school CSA program, lean into their relationships with two tech-based distribution platforms with which they’d already worked, and transition the rest of their business to sales and distribution platform Barn2Door. Now, late-pandemic farming looks like skipping the market, staying in bed for hours longer on Saturday, and enjoying a cup of coffee together — all while quadrupling business by selling online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agSsAQ"&gt;Does this ever-expanding landscape of food distribution tech make the job easy? Not in all ways, says Donck. “There’s always room for improvement. For example, everybody wants cucumbers, but we don’t have any right now,”  he says, lamenting the loss of a week’s crop to a swarm of squash bugs. “[Our customers] will have to go somewhere else for those.” But he and Jarrard agree, they don’t intend to go back to the way things were before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A web store showing pictures of different cuts of meat. A series of filters lets you view vegetables, eggs &amp;amp;amp; dairy, meat, mushrooms, and more." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-GbDgSt877eV2NyTSd5uASNPwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773614/crystalorganicstore.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crystal Organic Farm’s online store, powered by Barn2Door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4Ibto"&gt;They’re not alone. One of three digital platforms they now work with, Barn2Door, &lt;a href="https://www.barn2door.com/blog/2020/4/11/the-data-proves-it-local-farms-are-surging-online"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a 457 percent increase in revenue from orders and an 807 percent increase in the number of orders among their sellers in March 2020 alone. (In August, they ran a $6 million funding round to try and keep up.) Another — an online shopping platform called Fresh Harvest, which processes orders and facilitates door-to-door delivery across Georgia, and which Donck estimates constitutes some three-quarters of Crystal Organic’s business — tripled its year-over-year revenue in 2020, bringing in &lt;a href="https://blog.freshharvestga.com/2020-year-in-review/"&gt;$4 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWlHm5"&gt;This massive growth spans the sector: Harvie, which facilitates the direct sale and delivery of customized farm shares, launched 13 years ago. This past year, the company saw a 500 percent year-over-year increase in its farmers’ sales and quintupled the size of its team. WhatsGood, an app that facilitates purchase and pick-up between consumers and local fishermen, farmers, and foragers, grew from some 30,000 buyers to around 200,000 between January 2020 and December, according to founder Matt Tortora. The founder of Food4All, a platform designed to help farmers integrate all these other platforms, estimates growth in the past year and a half by a factor of seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bBZq37"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Farmers markets were really a counterproductive business model for a lot of farmers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zU8ZvZ"&gt;As with so many other shifts the pandemic accelerated, this growth shines a light on trends that were already in play: the &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e70ea6d10d5dc73a27d1184/t/5ea8f98be8098b7653211a83/1588132249515/SARE+Farmers+Market+Toolkit+2020.pdf"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt; of farmers market attendance; the &lt;a href="https://www.harvie.farm/blog/home-delivery-is-the-future-of-local-food/"&gt;growing demand&lt;/a&gt; for home delivery. “Farmers markets were really a counterproductive business model for a lot of farmers,” says Tortora, a former chef who founded WhatsGood in 2014. In recent years, farmers markets across the US reported a  “downward trend,” with year-over-year attendance and sales down by between &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e70ea6d10d5dc73a27d1184/t/5ea8f98be8098b7653211a83/1588132249515/SARE+Farmers+Market+Toolkit+2020.pdf"&gt;20 and 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; as of 2018, even while interest in locally sourced food has ticked &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2019/11/19/exploring-a-decade-of-big-changes-in-local-food/"&gt;upward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9VLG7"&gt;As this trend progresses, a growing number of local chefs, and eventually consumers, have come to apps like WhatsGood to connect with independent producers online. On Tortora’s app, they can browse local goods on the web or in the mobile app, fill a digital cart, check out in a single transaction, and then pick up their goods at a local hub — which might be a brewery donating space in its off hours, a single farm, or farmer’s market. In 2018, the company piloted a delivery business model, which yielded “holy shit numbers,” Tortora says. “It was a real ‘ah ha’ moment. Meat producers that would bring in $1,000 a day at farmers markets made four to five times that on their first day offering delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTWgv"&gt;While acknowledging that the last year was all kinds of terrible, the couple behind third-generation family-owned Ever-Breeze Farm in Westerly, Rhode Island, have to agree: Local food thrived. John Panciera, who runs his family’s dairy and grass-fed beef farm with his partner Bianca Lee Paredes, says the pandemic changed their community’s attitude, boosting customer interest and appreciation for locally sourced goods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An online store with photos of meat and eggs. You can buy beef bones, chorizo sausage links, Italian sausage, T-bone steak, and different packages of eggs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5W55uahTeiGuOQzgc3K8B-p9r8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773653/everbreezestore.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever-Breeze Farm’s store on WhatsGood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G1Z1mI"&gt;“I’ve been hesitant to say this to certain people, but COVID was really good for business,” Panciera says. “We just happened to take a chance, doubling the size of our flock last spring, and thank goodness we did, because as many eggs as we sold, we could have sold more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNJCuF"&gt;While, thanks to Paredes’s thinking outside the box, Ever-Breeze had already started to use WhatsGood for a sliver of their business pre-pandemic, they still largely relied on walk-in sales, peddling goods out of an old milkhouse on an honor system, in which customers would scrawl their names and purchases in a spiral-bound notebook and shove cash into a slit-topped coffee can. This made for chaotic energy, the couple recalls, with a dozen or more cars coming in and out of the driveway at all hours. Plus, it was a system that proved hard to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bPVkxx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you get it exactly right, it’s great — but you have to get it exactly right.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KH86Kf"&gt;Come spring of 2020, Panciera and Paredes decided to ditch the chaotic driveway model altogether and pivot their focus to digital distribution, which, within months, led to growing their egg market, scaling up their beef business, and even hiring their first-ever employee. In the app, Ever-Breeze’s products can reach customers from Massachusetts to eastern Connecticut — and the supply chain still feels as local as can be. “We’re being afforded this direct-to-consumer relationship,” Paredes says. “I know the names of the people I’m feeding, and that’s a big deal to me. If I stocked a grocery store in town with our beef, would I sell it? Probably, but would it feel the same? I don’t think so.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbI2ZM"&gt;The transition hasn’t been completely breezy, riddled with learning curves from permitting and expiration dates to needing unprecedented levels of consistency in their operation. And for the farmers attempting to combine and balance multiple of these apps in order to walk the tightrope between maximizing sales and meeting demand, those learning curves are even steeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Hl3"&gt;The platforms are trying to ease the friction. “In a lot of ways, this is a horrible business,” Harvie founder Simon Huntley says. “You’ve got perishable products, you’ve got high cost of goods sold, high labor costs, high capital costs, high delivery costs, low profit margin... If you get it exactly right, it’s great — but you have to get it exactly right.” Tech that can meet those challenges goes far beyond your basic e-commerce, and this niche corner of the tech world, he noted, is “littered with the corpses” of many venture capital-backed projects that came before, spent millions on product, and have “nothing to show for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRtf1a"&gt;While they perfect their methods, farmers are along for the ride. Despite two decades of doing things a certain way in Newborn, Donck and Jarrard have zero plans to go back to the market if they can help it, focused instead on perfecting the balancing act between platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JztKTj"&gt;Likewise, Panciera and Paredes are committing to the new models they adopted last spring. But already, things are starting to feel different. To keep up with the new volume, and the flock and livestock they planned around it, there will be no resting on their laurels. “We’re not looking back,” Panciera says. “But this year has shown us that, all right, you got lucky last year. Some of this just fell into our lap. But this year, we’ve had to start marketing a little harder now than we were,” he says. “From here on out, it’s going to be a different story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl8zW1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="232WH3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro review: these earbuds get a lot of things right</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The company’s most refined earbuds yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="udIoHB"&gt;The new $150 OnePlus Buds Pro are the company’s most elegant, polished set of true wireless earbuds so far. And there’s a lot of value packaged together for that price: they include active noise cancellation, wireless charging, IP55 dust and water resistance, and solid battery life. OnePlus also tosses in extras like a low-latency mode for gaming and Zen Mode Air, which plays soothing relaxation audio. They go on sale September 1st in either matte black or glossy white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anEz6R"&gt;The OnePlus Buds look quite sleek and less blatantly AirPods-esque (particularly the black version) than the company’s prior earbuds. Hopefully that’ll be enough to avoid any snags at US customs. They’ve also proven dependable and consistent in my testing so far, which couldn’t be said of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;$99 Nothing earbuds&lt;/a&gt; when I looked at those a few weeks ago. I bring up the Nothing buds because they’re the first project of OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s new company and, at least on paper, have similar capabilities, so there will inevitably be comparisons between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JrOYQd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10714688"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kT1giN"&gt;The earbuds have a shortened-stem design with a metallic finish on the stem portion. That’s a nice touch of style, and it’s also a marker of where you’ll pinch for controls. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457468/airpods-pro-force-sensor-control-audio-button"&gt;AirPods Pro force sensor&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus Buds Pro have identical controls on either side: pinch quickly with two fingers to pause, twice to skip songs, three times to go back, or hold to switch between ANC and transparency modes. There’s even the same faint little audio click in your ears whenever a pinch is registered. &lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; the AirPods, there’s no indented area of the stem for the sensor, but I found OnePlus’ approach to work reliably without it. It’s very much a borrowed idea, but one that’s at least copied well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGJAWV"&gt;I found the OnePlus Buds Pro to be airy and comfortable in my ears; they weigh 4.35 grams per earbud, lighter than both the AirPods Pro and more recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. But I never found a perfect fit with the three sets of silicone tips in the box: the large size was best, but I could still remove either earbud with the slightest pull. Their lightweight design helped mitigate this issue somewhat and kept them in my ears — they didn’t come loose when I shook my head or ate with them in — but OnePlus really could’ve used a more accommodating selection of ear tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6h63DEaW6azn8uU-w15vHQCU8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800050/DSCF4677_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case supports wireless charging and is IPX4 water resistant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsGqmS"&gt;Thankfully the less-than-perfect seal didn’t take away from their audio quality. The OnePlus Buds have 11mm drivers that the company says were “tuned for bass reproduction,” and that bears out when you listen to them. There’s a powerful, smooth foundation to tracks like “Don’t Go Dark” by Bleachers, and the OnePlus Buds Pro avoid becoming a bloated jumble of bass thanks a pleasing, non-harsh high end with ample detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoFv5b"&gt;The mids are a bit recessed, which is fairly common for earbuds at this price, and unfortunately OnePlus’ HeyMelody app (available for both Android and iOS) doesn’t include EQ adjustments. But I’ve been largely happy with how these sound, and they hold their own against the Amazon Echo Buds 2, Galaxy Buds 2, Jabra earbuds, and others in their price range. And I think they outrank the Nothing earbuds, but perhaps that should be expected for the $50 price difference. OnePlus includes an audio test to personalize your audio profile based on your own hearing. Like most other attempts at this, I wasn’t blown away by the difference and left this off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHidoHojD-9BjdUHmo8HVarF1MM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800066/DSCF4679_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds are $50 more expensive than the Nothing Ear 1s (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6yGHgkdiREzSgnRhV_7BUtpZxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800072/DSCF4681_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both earbuds have a stemmed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="peEofp"&gt;ANC performance has also been satisfactory, though I think it’d be more impressive if the earbuds sealed in my ears better. As is, the OnePlus Buds Pro let you manually pick between “extreme” and “faint” modes for noise cancellation. OnePlus says these range between 40dB (extreme) and 15dB (faint) of noise cancellation. There’s also a “smart” mode that automatically adjusts the level of ANC based on the loudness of your environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MptVMX"&gt;That’s where I left it for portions of my review, and the earbuds did seem to dial back their noise-canceling powers when I was in my living room, where the only noise was the whirl of a nearby fan. On the street and at my local coffee shop, it seemed like the OnePlus Buds Pro defaulted to cranking the ANC, which is precisely what I wanted. The OnePlus Buds Pro are quite good at ridding your ears of low-frequency noises and distractions, and they did a respectable job on New York subways. I think Amazon slightly bests them, and pricier buds like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds definitely still win out on the whole, but for $150, there’s not much to take issue with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0t7vT"&gt;The same holds true of battery life. It’s rated at up to five hours of straight playback with ANC on, and that extends to 23 hours including the case’s extra juice. Leave noise cancellation off and those figures grow to seven hours and a claimed 31 hours, respectively. I wasn’t able to fully test out the last estimate there, but in general the OnePlus Buds seemed faithful to the others and I didn’t have any unexpected battery issues or uneven discharging. The case can be charged wirelessly, and it’s even rated IPX4 for water resistance, which is pretty rare to see. The earbuds have a more durable IP55 rating for dust and water resistance, so as long as your fit is right, they’re a fine pick for workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qxv35rBi5cVrMXsNPpuDQWzDjLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800068/DSCF4682_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case is easily pocketable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZh4ou"&gt;Microphone performance was sufficient for voice calls, and those I spoke with could make me out clearly. But despite three mics in each earbud and wind noise reduction algorithms, I think it’s just a reality that as the stems of these earbuds get cut down in length, we’ll need to settle for “good enough” when speaking to people through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JojRsr"&gt;Then come the miscellaneous features. The earbuds have a low-latency “Pro Gaming mode” where their response is 94 milliseconds, but only when paired with a OnePlus phone running OxygenOS 11 or above. (This is another example of the earbuds&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627099/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-apple-airpods-pro-ecosystem-lock-in-features-companion-app"&gt; lock-in that my colleague Jon Porter recently wrote about&lt;/a&gt;.) Even then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632338/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-review"&gt;competitors like Razer&lt;/a&gt; are capable of hitting lower latency numbers like 60ms. Another OnePlus-exclusive feature is Dolby Atmos audio, which the earbuds don’t support on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CowWoW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10714700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDL9HV"&gt;More useful to me personally was the Zen Mode Air feature, which aims to help you relax by playing soothing sounds through the earbuds. You can pick which audio track you like best in the HeyMelody app — with options like warm sunrise, meditation, summer seashore, nighttime camping, etc. — and then it’s downloaded directly to the earbuds’ memory. This has the benefit of keeping the relaxation sounds available when you’re switching between different paired devices. OnePlus isn’t alone in offering this type of functionality: Jabra includes something similar with its earbuds. It’s not the sort of thing I’ll use frequently, but I like knowing this little trick is there if I need a minute or two of calm during a hectic day. Unfortunately the OnePlus Buds take after many competitors in that they currently lack multipoint pairing, so they can only connect to one device at a time. However, OnePlus says it aims to add multipoint through a future firmware update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pKrwVB"&gt;Compared to its past wireless earbuds, the refinement and strong performance of the OnePlus Buds Pro demonstrate that OnePlus has grown confident and comfortable in this market. There’s no shortage of competition at this price, but OnePlus has brought together a compelling mix of features and an attractive design with relatively few weak spots. They’re another reminder of just how much you can get for $150.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAdznz"&gt;Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/p9lasb/i_designed_and_printed_a_working_simpsons_tv/"&gt;buba447 has created&lt;/a&gt; an iconic &lt;em&gt;Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;TV with working dials that plays episodes of the long-running animated sitcom whenever it’s turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayDaEG"&gt;The palm-sized TV was designed in Fusion 360 and printed using an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcreality3d.shop%2Fproducts%2Fcreality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637549%2Fdiy-simpsons-tv-raspberry-pi-3d-printing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ender-3 Pro from Creality&lt;/a&gt;, according to its creator. Inside you’ll find a tiny &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/"&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero&lt;/a&gt; running Jessie Lite connected to the 640x480 display. The top dial turns on the TV (actually, just the display and speaker) while the lower dial adjusts the volume. Its 32GB SD Card is loaded with 11 seasons of compressed episodes that play in random order. The whole thing is powered by a USB port with a cable running out the back.&lt;/p&gt;
