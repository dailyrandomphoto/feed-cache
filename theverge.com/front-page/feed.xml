    <title>The 2022 Geneva Motor Show is nixed thanks to COVID and the chip shortage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jb8jgG"&gt;The 2022 Geneva International Motor Show, slated to happen in February, has &lt;a href="https://www.gims.swiss/news/geneva-international-motor-show-postpones-create-more-impactful-event-2023"&gt;been canceled&lt;/a&gt; as the COVID pandemic persists and the auto industry struggles with a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuFzjY"&gt;Organizers said Thursday that there are still too many “uncertainties” related to the pandemic and the shortage for automakers to commit to the show, which usually serves as a showcase for wild supercars, concepts, and prototypes. The hope is to have “a more impactful show in 2023” with more virtual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="585IEy"&gt;“We have pushed very hard and tried everything to reactivate the Geneva International Motor Show in 2022,” Maurice Turrettini, who runs the committee in charge of the show, said in a statement. “Despite all our efforts, we have to face the facts and the reality: the pandemic situation is not under control and presents itself as a big threat for a large indoor event like GIMS. But we see this decision as a postponement, rather than a cancellation. I am confident that the Geneva International Motor Show will come back stronger than ever in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ms2cG9"&gt;Sandro Mesquita, the CEO of the show, said the “chip crisis is likely to drag on well into next year, with negative financial implications for OEMs. In these uncertain times, many brands are therefore unable to make a commitment to participate in a trade fair that would have taken place in just over four months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OIoOz"&gt;The Geneva Motor Show was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21156368/geneva-motor-show-2020-canceled-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;first big auto shows to get scrapped in early 2020&lt;/a&gt; before the spread of the coronavirus had been officially labeled a pandemic. While a few have started back up again in recent months, the delta variant of the virus has forced organizers’ hands with events &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609757/new-york-auto-show-2021-canceled-delta-variant-covid"&gt;like the New York International Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, which was canceled again in August. The Los Angeles Auto Show, set for mid-November, is &lt;a href="https://dot.la/la-auto-show-electric-vehicles-2655049301.html"&gt;still on track to happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City trailer goes back to the beginning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMiNGV0V6TNctJkELEIlitd3Hc0=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964948/img1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3NJpr"&gt;Sony Pictures Entertainment has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q6UGCyHZCI"&gt;a new trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt;, the next live-action film based on the popular horror video game franchise, ahead of the movie’s November 24th release in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LLnC0"&gt;The movie, which is a reboot for the film side of the franchise, looks to be filled with &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; hallmarks. It takes place in Raccoon City, series mainstays Claire Redfield, Leon Kennedy, Jill Valentine, and Chris Redfield are all featured, something about the Umbrella Corporation is apparently at the heart of the conflict, and the main characters look like they will spend some time fleeing zombies in a spooky mansion. (There’s even a part in the trailer where a zombie dog shatters a window.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqIZtu"&gt;Here’s the official synopsis of the film, if you want to know a bit more about what to expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IWQ1BW"&gt;In RESIDENT EVIL: WELCOME TO RACCOON CITY, once the booming home of pharmaceutical giant Umbrella Corporation, Raccoon City is now a dying Midwestern town. The company’s exodus left the city a wasteland…with great evil brewing below the surface. When that evil is unleashed, a group of survivors must work together to uncover the truth behind Umbrella and make it through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tno6iK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City &lt;/em&gt;caps what’s been a good year for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; fans. Capcom released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;excellent &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;, and the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; premiered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567062/resident-evil-infinite-darkness-review-netflix"&gt;on Netflix in July&lt;/a&gt;. And if you still have a hunger for more &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; content ahead of &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City’s &lt;/em&gt;release, you can always watch &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(film_series)"&gt;one of the six other &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kathryn Hahn’s WandaVision villain could be getting her own Disney Plus show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVe3D-UO18TaCXLQBqiDOA3RRvw=/155x57:1507x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964513/agatha_winking_meme.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios / Disney Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbXMHN"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; spinoff series starring Kathryn Hahn is reportedly in the works for Disney Plus, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/wandavision-spinoff-kathryn-hahn-1235082445/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8sJJn"&gt;In the show, Hahn would reprise her role as the meddling witch Agatha Harkness, with &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; head writer Jac Schaeffer serving as both writer and executive producer on the project. &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;’s report does note that the project is still in development, meaning that there’s a chance that Disney and Marvel may not actually go through with the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avAsNm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7KRPd"&gt;Hahn was arguably the breakout star of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;. She starts the show as just Wanda and Vision’s overly inquisitive neighbor, before being fully revealed in the viral and Emmy-award winning hit song “Agatha All Along” as the witch Agatha Harkness, the mastermind behind the couple’s trials and tribulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MoQ9F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; ended with Wanda defeating Agatha in a CGI-powered duel of sorcery, leaving Hahn’s character stuck without her powers in her overly friendly neighbor persona, but the show very intentionally left the door open for the character to return in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PdGqQG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can now listen to WandaVision’s “It Was Agatha All Along” on Spotify and Apple Music","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297497/wandavision-spoiler-episode-7-soundtrack-song-disney-plus-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vYTyoC"&gt;If Disney does go through with the Agatha Harkness show, it would join a crowded list of future Disney Plus series. That list includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671358/hawkeye-first-trailer-disney-plus-christmas-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; in November, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She-Hulk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;, and a series set in Wakanda from &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; director Ryan Coogler. Second seasons of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; are also in the works, along with a reported &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; spinoff, &lt;em&gt;Echo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube cancels Rewind for good after years of everyone hating it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Will Smith in Rewind" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJbJjrli6W_ED6p4PlockymRPW0=/74x0:1370x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964471/Screen_Shot_2019_02_05_at_3.24.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2jX8n"&gt;YouTube Rewind — the company’s annual year-end round-up of trends, creators, memes, and the most popular videos on the site — has been canceled for good, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/10/07/youtube-no-longer-making-year-end-rewind-videos/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TubeFilter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4eZN7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all the creators involved in Rewind - we’ll be   for your Rewinds as we refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube   with a different and updated kind of experience - stay tuned! → &lt;a href="https://t.co/kI69C24eL0"&gt;https://t.co/kI69C24eL0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube Creators (@YouTubeCreators) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeCreators/status/1446103025500577796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXGom"&gt;Instead, YouTube will “refocus our energies on celebrating you and the trends that make YouTube [fire emoji] with a different and updated kind of experience,” although the company didn’t elaborate further on what it’ll be replacing Rewind with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeBa8l"&gt;YouTube will also be relying on creators on its platform to fill the gap, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;TubeFeed&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll “continue to be inspiring to see the myriad of ways the most creative content producers in the world — our YouTube creators — encapsulate the end of year in their video recaps, as YouTube retires its own Rewind video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsiA"&gt;The news of YouTube canceling Rewind permanently isn’t a huge surprise. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1326947861305696263"&gt;already took off 2020&lt;/a&gt;, citing the difficulties of the year: “2020 has been different. And it doesn’t feel right to carry on as if it weren’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HCw9Sy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube is canceling Rewind this year because 2020 has been too much ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562697/youtube-rewind-canceled-2020-pandemic-creators-community"},{"title":"PewDiePie makes his return to YouTube Rewind after two years of controversy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"},{"title":"YouTube Rewind 2018 is officially the most disliked video on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mInJcb"&gt;But Rewind had already been struggling long before the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;2018’s video&lt;/a&gt; was viciously panned by the YouTube community (to this day, it remains the most disliked video ever posted to the platform). Creators argued that the company was shifting focus from the “real community” — including controversial creators like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy"&gt;Logan Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095517/pewdiepie-t-series-youtube-fan-campaign-subscribers"&gt;PewDiePie&lt;/a&gt; — in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;more advertiser-friendly choices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u9LMp"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20987248/youtube-rewind-2019-pewdiepie-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-james-charles-tati-westbrook"&gt;2019’s video&lt;/a&gt; attempted to skirt controversy entirely by shifting its format from the big-budget mashup of YouTubers from years past to a more ordinary (and boring) list of clips of most-watched creators, videos, and trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s1yZV"&gt;But whether well-received or endlessly dunked on, Rewind videos have been a big part of YouTube’s culture for the past decade. Hopefully, whatever YouTube does end up doing to replace its big year-end celebration ends up a little less controversial going forward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s IPO filing reveals Amazon’s prime influence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-CES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCF1R8_AlMgwOSRiEJIWd2L02AA=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964446/1192411781.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Plus more details about Ford’s relationship with the buzzy EV startup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="mJLFXn"&gt;EV startup Rivian has spent most of its life shrouded in secrecy, but now that it’s going public, that protective veil is lifting. And nothing has been more revealing to date than the regulatory &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705048/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-ipo-ford-amazon"&gt;filing made public late Friday night&lt;/a&gt;, which provides new information on the startup’s relationships with its major backers, Amazon and Ford, details about how much money it has spent so far (a lot), and projections for how much it expects to spend now that its first EV is in production (a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URbKQ5"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm"&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Form S-1, serves as a sort of ultra-detailed pitch to the financial markets. It has a letter from Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. It outlines the company’s recent financial history and details its three launch vehicles: the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and the Amazon delivery van. It also lays out the startup’s ambitions — both the gauzy ones, like its mission to “Keep The World Adventurous Forever,” and the more concrete, like “sell lots of electric vehicles” (not an actual quote). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ae6GNY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian’s mission is to “keep the world adventurous forever”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="joPBoX"&gt;Rivian’s S-1 is notable for what’s not in it, too. There are a bunch of key numbers still missing that we won’t get until the startup files subsequent amendments, including exactly how much voting power or ownership any one company or person currently has. Also absent: any unseemly self-dealing like what doomed WeWork IPO, though Scaringe did receive an equity award this year that could one day be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvnWJz"&gt;Let’s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CEHWhl"&gt;Amazon on top&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L9Dgqq"&gt;It’s no secret that Amazon is heavily invested in Rivian and has announced plans to buy up to 100,000 custom delivery vans from the startup. Rivian also disclosed in a legal filing earlier this year that Amazon (and Ford) own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501?lang=en"&gt;at least 10 percent of the startup’s shares&lt;/a&gt;. But the S-1 and the supporting documents filed with it offer a much greater window into this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZgftE"&gt;While it’s hard to put an exact number on it until Rivian discloses more information, we now know that Amazon probably owns somewhere between a fifth and a quarter of the EV startup. Amazon purchased some 26 percent of the 576 million shares Rivian offered during its Series A through F funding rounds (which spanned from February 2019 to January 2021). It will net a few million more when Rivian lists on the Nasdaq, too, in exchange for participating in the startup’s most recent rise in July. (Instead of selling shares this time, though, Rivian essentially borrowed a total of $2.5 billion from Amazon, Ford, T. Rowe Price, and Mannheim Investments. Those debts will convert into shares in the IPO.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5J2M4G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has bought 26 percent of Rivian shares sold since its Series A funding round&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEHYJB"&gt;Rivian doesn’t detail how many shares existed before its Series A fundraising round or how many Scaringe owns, all of which would affect the final tally. (Scaringe does have voting control, according to a few allusions made in the filing.) But Amazon owns more than any other outside firm. T. Rowe Price is second, with around 22 percent of the shares sold from the Series A round onward, and Ford comes in at about 17 percent. In total, Amazon has committed around $1.83 billion to Rivian to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8phWY"&gt;What does all that money buy Amazon? The collaboration on the electric delivery van, for one thing. That partnership will not only help Amazon start to electrify its fleet, but it carries an almost intangible value — because, like rival shipping giants, Amazon had previously wasted a lot of time talking to other EV startups about going electric, only to run into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs1770"&gt;All that money also seems to have bought Amazon a little freedom. As part of the agreements with Rivian — &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521289903/d157488dex1012.htm"&gt;redacted versions&lt;/a&gt; of which &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521289903/d157488dex1013.htm"&gt;were filed alongside&lt;/a&gt; the S-1 — Amazon can develop, or tap other third-party manufacturers to develop, similar electric delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jtAWpe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon gets exclusive rights to the van for four years, and first dibs for two more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvwI2A"&gt;In fact, until the van is ready for production and has passed all government approvals, Amazon has the right to mix up what it’s ordering from Rivian in a number of ways. It can go ahead and buy the 100,000 electric vans as advertised. Or, Amazon can just purchase Rivian’s electric drivetrains (or “skateboards”) and have another company develop matching cabins, or “top hats.” If it wants to, Amazon has the contractual right to only buy “certain Component Parts of the Skateboard (but not the full Skateboard).” And if Rivian runs into real trouble, Amazon could walk away with the tooling for the top hat it co-developed with Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNxZtf"&gt;Amazon gets to approve certain vendors for things like battery cells and autonomous technologies, too. It’s also possible that it may get a cut of any government incentives or credits that Rivian’s vans are eligible for — though that particular section of the agreement is redacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4kik6"&gt;Amazon’s influence over Rivian can be found in the startup’s bottom line, too — Rivian admits in the document that a “significant portion” of the “near-term” revenue it generates will come from the conglomerate. Amazon also has exclusive rights to the vans for four years and the right of first refusal for two years after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9o8LR5"&gt;Rivian’s prototypes were Built Ford Tough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kiwJkd"&gt;Rivian and Ford were up front about collaborating when the Detroit automaker announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;initial investment in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though one project — an electric Lincoln — has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240212/ford-lincoln-cancel-rivian-suv-ev-coronavirus-pandemic-investment"&gt;since been abandoned&lt;/a&gt;. But Rivian reveals in its S-1 that it has been getting help from Ford, as one of the automaker’s subsidiaries (Troy Design and Manufacturing Co.) developed and built all prototype and pre-production “bodies-in-white” for the R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and even the electric delivery vans for Amazon. (Body-in-white is an industry term that essentially refers to the skeletal frame that sits atop the chassis.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ge6cIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford built the bodies-in-white for the prototype pickups, SUVs, and vans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Moz2l9"&gt;Rivian paid Ford $74 million for this work through the end of 2020 while it built out its own stamping and assembly lines at its Normal, Illinois factory. The startup says it will stamp and assemble its own bodies-in-white for production vehicles, but it will continue to lean on Ford in other ways. In April of this year, the companies struck a deal where the startup will buy “certain vehicle components” from Ford, “including related engineering work and tooling,” for the entire R1 lineup of vehicles. In total, Ford has committed just shy of $1.24 billion to Rivian to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EoQAVY"&gt;Rivian has raised a lot of money — but will need a lot more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jNhPHL"&gt;It is not new information that Rivian has raised more than $10 billion to date, but Rivian takes some time in the S-1 to shed light on how it has spent — and how it plans to spend — that money. It also alludes to needing much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFNRVF"&gt;Some $2 billion has already gone to getting the factory ready in Illinois, while a much smaller sum of around $30 million has been spent on marketing. In all, Rivian says it lost $426 million in 2019, $1 billion across 2020, and $994 million in the first six months of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yne7U4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$8 billion spent through 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mn2Q9E"&gt;It will continue this pace of spending, too, as Rivian is eyeing a spot for a second factory and has other vehicles in the pipeline. The company says in the filing that, to meet those ambitions, it expects to spend $8 billion through the end of 2023. In fact, Rivian says the $3.67 billion it has in cash, the proceeds it raises from the IPO, and $750 million in pre-approved loans backed by its assets is enough to cover “at least the next 12 months” but makes no guarantees beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="18sUK9"&gt;What’s the plan, exactly? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EQCvvQ"&gt;Rivian says in the filing that it has logged just over 48,000 preorders for the R1T pickup and R1S SUV. But it’s not as open about how quickly it plans to scale up production for those eager customers. The startup says the current version of the Illinois factory could produce as many as 150,000 vehicles annually and that, by the end of 2023, it plans to increase that to 200,000. It does not, however, provide estimates or targets for how many it actually wants to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lQobT"&gt;In fact, this is one of the “risk factors” in the filing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7jYa8x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our passion and focus on delivering a high-quality and engaging Rivian experience may not maximize short-term financial results, which may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations and could result in our stock price being negatively affected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vFZvQt"&gt;It’s a cautionary approach compared to how some of Rivian’s rivals have behaved, though going through a traditional IPO process (versus a merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC) means Rivian is more restricted in how optimistic it can be when pitching investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dHveAc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian gets a lot of (deserved) attention for its pickup, but it may take a back seat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJKHLc"&gt;Still, Scaringe told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last year that he expected it to take &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/rivian-buyers-can-customize-orders-but-the-wait-could-be-long?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;two years&lt;/a&gt; to get through the order book his company had accumulated at that time. And on Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported that the majority of the focus will be on the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-06/how-amazon-pushed-rivian-s-van-into-the-fast-lane?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Amazon vans in the early going&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian has already had to delay the launch of the R1T and R1S due to the global chip shortage, meaning customers who placed a refundable $1,000 deposit may think twice as the wait stretches on and more electric trucks and SUVs hit the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g9cNNO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck took me to the top of the mountain","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ejgLIm"&gt;Perhaps that’s why Rivian is already spending millions of dollars on marketing. Though, it is taking a page from Tesla in eschewing traditional advertising. From the filing (emphasis mine): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SkwIgA"&gt;We generate awareness without sacrificing authenticity. The Rivian brand keeps an honest, approachable, transparent tone and is designed around adventure. We have built our brand and its expressions in-house, spanning creative, marketing, design, digital development, content production, events planning, and analytics. &lt;strong&gt;No agencies of record. No paid media. We rely on both shared and earned media to connect directly with our community through engaging content, rich digital experiences, and immersive events.&lt;/strong&gt; Building awareness organically creates deeper bonds with our community and draws even more people in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pL4WaA"&gt;Immediately after that, Rivian writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hZvrrE"&gt;Every consumer interaction comes directly from Rivian; whether it is attending an event, subscribing to our digital content, or purchasing one of our vehicles. We do not rely on third parties or franchisees to engage with our consumers. This one-to-one connection starts at the earliest stages of our relationship, allowing us to form stronger bonds and more deeply understand our consumer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qNYmF2"&gt;Which brings us to the last point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jok21O"&gt;Rivian plans to make lots of money off its customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="veD3pu"&gt;However many Rivian-branded vehicles the startup sells, it’s hoping to harvest thousands of additional dollars beyond what customers plop down at the outset. The startup says it believes the “lifetime revenue” opportunity for each vehicle from software services alone is as much as $15,500 — $10,000 for autonomous driving features (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541571/tesla-full-self-driving-price-increase-10000-dollars-autopilot-beta"&gt;sound familiar&lt;/a&gt;?) and the rest for “a monthly subscription plan for infotainment, connectivity, diagnostics, and other services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vypIAd"&gt;Since Rivian wants to own the insurance and service pieces of the customer experience as well, it believes it can make $8,700 and $3,500, respectively, per vehicle from those offerings. Add in what Rivian will make on trade-ins and resales, and on charging, and it says it expects to be able to make nearly $70,000 per vehicle over its lifetime and a similar amount for its commercial vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lfSoUC"&gt;
&lt;p id="MQY9wf"&gt;Especially when compared to other EV startups, Rivian played a very slow hand since its founding in 2009 — but it’s one that paid off in billions of dollars of investments from some of the biggest companies and financial institutions in the world. And it’s now one of the very first to follow Tesla into the extremely challenging arena of mass-manufacturing electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdJCEl"&gt;Only one other startup has followed a similar trajectory: Lucid Motors, which is also finally going into production at the moment. Some of the beats of Lucid Motors’ story are different — it went the SPAC route instead of an IPO, for instance. But the same core question remains: what sacrifices or tradeoffs were made in order to achieve this goal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9c7Np8"&gt;In Lucid Motors’ case, it found salvation and the necessary funding by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;handing over ownership of the company to Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian’s S-1 doesn’t reveal the same kind of transfer of power, and common sense provided that Amazon was going to be an important part of its future. The S-1 helps describe Amazon’s gravity in this relationship — an immeasurable force that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos teased at in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbezos/status/1445926804758269959?s=21"&gt;a rare tweet earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="smqcX9"&gt;“Rivian team is world class, and @RJScaringe is one of the greatest entrepreneurs I’ve ever met,” he wrote. “Now, RJ, where are our vans?!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is releasing a translucent controller for Xbox’s 20th birthday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox wireless controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeNB66NfX-n0T0QcD_DWMG3LQAs=/0x0:1165x777/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964036/xbox20thbirthday.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dEtAtv"&gt;Microsoft is celebrating the 20th birthday of Xbox with a couple of new, translucent accessories, including a wireless controller and a wired gaming headset. They’ll launch on November 15th, 2021 — marking 20 years to the day — and preorders are available now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJu9k"&gt;Starting with the controller, Microsoft says its translucent look is a callback to the see-through controllers that shipped with the original Xbox debug kits. There are splashes of the brand’s signature green on the Xbox home button, as well as around the D-pad and rear grips. Microsoft colored the components silver so they’d be easier to see through its casing. Internally, though, it’s the same model as the one that ships with the Series S and Series X consoles, with Bluetooth support for connecting to mobile devices and PCs. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-20th-Anniversary-Special-Edition%2F8R419TH0Z8NV%2F5JHM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This controller costs $69.99 to preorder through the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Anniversary-Special-x/dp/B09GHQVX3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yWOOC5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Connect your 20th Anniversary controller to your Xbox Series X|S and unlock an exclusive dynamic background bursting to life with glowing lines and moving sparks  ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/RnCpzr9rDR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RnCpzr9rDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox (@Xbox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1446116217622695945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nemqcg"&gt;The wired Xbox stereo headset is also getting the translucent treatment, but on a smaller level. Its ear cups are see-through, with a green 20th anniversary marking on the left ear cup. There are also bright green accents on the grilles between the ear pads and cups, as well as on the microphone. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets%2F20th-anniversary-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This special-edition headset will cost $69.99&lt;/a&gt; from the Microsoft Store and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Anniversary-Special-x/dp/B09GHYCW8L/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, as well, which is $10 over the standard model’s pricing. You can read more about this model (sans the cool 20th anniversary design) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;in our previous coverage here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Department of Justice creates cryptocurrency enforcement unit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L19mS4pie_R0e0o1_pSRbOf9ZTY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963919/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtlvND"&gt;The US Department of Justice has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team"&gt;created a team&lt;/a&gt; to investigate cryptocurrency-related crime. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) will handle investigations of “crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors,” the agency said in a news release. Mixing and tumbling services can obscure the source of a cryptocurrency transaction, by mixing it with other funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq28nL"&gt;Cryptocurrency is “used in a wide variety of criminal activity,” including ransomware demand payments, money laundering, and for the illegal sales of drugs, weapons, and malware, the agency noted. Several high-profile ransomware cases have involved demands in cryptocurrency, including the Colonial Pipeline attack in May, where the company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a $5 million&lt;/a&gt; ransom to DarkSide (the group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;later apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of the hack). And the Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;issued sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrtycA"&gt;The DOJ says the NCET, which will provide expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions for the Justice Department and other US government agencies, will draw team members from the DOJ’s money laundering, intellectual property, and computer crimes divisions, as well as from US attorneys’ offices across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jx9PFd"&gt;The team will be under the supervision of Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. to start, but the Justice Department is seeking to hire someone who has “experience with complex criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and the blockchain,” on a more permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7DMlp"&gt;Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement that NCET would “draw on the Department’s cyber and money laundering expertise to strengthen our capacity to dismantle the financial entities that enable criminal actors to flourish— and quite frankly to profit— from abusing cryptocurrency platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsHJg8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple CarPlay could control more parts of your vehicle in the future</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SlP45u"&gt;Ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/4/9258013/apple-car-play-review"&gt;since it was introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Apple CarPlay has represented a notable upgrade over the user interfaces most cars have by default, but many of our concerns about it, and Android Auto, come up due to their limitations.  Newer features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875604/apple-carplay-ios13-multiple-screen-no-support"&gt;dual-screen support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17913786/google-maps-waze-apple-carplay-iphone-ios-12-review"&gt;third-party apps like Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; could help, but there are still huge parts of the driving experience that exist outside of Apple’s control panel. Now, Mark Gurman reports for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/apple-s-plan-for-cars-using-iphone-to-control-a-c-seats-radio?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s “IronHeart” push envisions tying settings like climate controls, seat positioning, and even specific surround sound tweaks to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YqJg"&gt;This is a gap that Google has closed by cutting deals with automakers like Polestar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688309/honda-google-android-auto-assistant-driving-mode-gas"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; to use Android Automotive as the basis for their UI. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, while Apple’s plans would require carmaker participation, this isn’t a plan to provide the basis for an infotainment system like Android Automotive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hSJqwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The head of Android Auto on how Google will power the car of the near future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196234/google-android-auto-in-car-systems-apple-carplay-interview"},{"title":"Driving the Polestar 2, the first electric car with a brain by Google","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qRrw1B"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests it could resemble Apple’s smart home push with HomeKit, with an API that devices (in this case, cars) access with varying levels of support for control and sensor communication. One interesting wrinkle is the mention that with iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/deprecated-sirikit-intent-domains"&gt;Apple removed several API features from SiriKit,&lt;/a&gt; making its occasionally disappointing assistant less capable than before. That includes controls that could, on compatible vehicles, manage these exact settings, like seat position, climate control, or audio source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zryatg"&gt;If the plans turn into real upgrades, that could mean different cars have different levels of feature support, with some using CarPlay to customize seat position, while others might not support that but could configure the vehicle’s A/C settings based on your iPhone preferences. As the report notes, so far, there has been limited support for things like manufacturer-provided CarPlay apps that can access these deeper control settings, and only BMW supports Apple CarKey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMQj5D"&gt;So what does this mean for Apple’s not-so-secret Project Titan car program? &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the CarPlay expansions wouldn’t collect car or user data, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;whatever project Kevin Lynch is now leading&lt;/a&gt; will need to glean useful insights in another way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Announcing Springboard: The Verge’s documentary on the forgotten history of the Treo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;premieres first on Monday, October 25th, on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new app on TV streaming devices: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV (Apple TV coming soon). Look for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; app on your streaming device or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680029/the-verge-tv-app-android-tv-amazon-fire-tv-roku"&gt;learn how to download here.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlKQ7B"&gt;If you want to be the very first to see it, &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; will also be screening in New York City on Saturday, October 23rd, and we’ll do a live Q&amp;amp;A session right after. We hope you can make it! You can get &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergearticle"&gt;tickets here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
