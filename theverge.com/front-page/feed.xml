    <title>Banjo-Kazooie returns to Nintendo hardware this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qJgNz4_4KmuCV_JjpRwtlSrEyY=/130x0:1534x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70406914/Screenshot_2022_01_19_at_16.00.07.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zUd6mX"&gt;Nintendo has announced the next game coming to its Switch Online service: Nintendo 64 platforming classic &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;. The game is inextricably associated with the N64 — it’s a collect-a-thon with blurry cartoon graphics and cute animal characters — but this will actually mark the first time you’ll have been able to play it on Nintendo hardware since Microsoft bought original developer Rare in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WHRb8"&gt;Rare did release a couple of spin-off titles for the Game Boy Advance, but the last major &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; game was 2008’s &lt;em&gt;Nuts &amp;amp; Bolts&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox 360. That game, as well as 360 ports of the original &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; and sequel &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Tooie&lt;/em&gt;, are also available on modern Xbox consoles through Game Pass and a compilation called &lt;em&gt;Rare Replay&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0P3ST"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt; will be available on Thursday for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online’s Expansion Pack, which brought N64 and Sega Genesis games to the service. Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815382/n64-switch-paper-mario-release-date-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; was added in December&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like Nintendo is planning to add roughly one N64 game a month, which isn’t exactly a breakneck pace of release but makes a change from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;NES and SNES deep cuts&lt;/a&gt; that used to show up every few months. Hopefully Nintendo is able to make sure that the emulation works better than it does with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;some of the earlier N64 titles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like FedEx won’t be adding lasers to its airplanes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BELGIUM-ECONOMY-LABOUR-DEMO-LOGO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TAjkJheoktepHgtgEj6WNeFXQY=/167x0:3616x2299/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70406328/1230688732.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by BENOIT DOPPAGNE/BELGA/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHUqjR"&gt;It looks like the FAA may have made a whoopsie. Remember when the US aviation authority &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-faa-reviews-fedex-proposal-install-a321-laser-based-missile-defense-system-2022-01-14/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that FedEx might possibly potentially maybe be able to stick a laser onto its cargo planes to knock missiles out of the sky? Yeah, no: “further internal study is necessary,” &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-01123/special-conditions-fedex-express-airbus-model-a321-200-airplanes-installation-of-an-infrared-laser"&gt;the FAA wrote on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-halts-review-fedex-proposal-install-a321-laser-based-missile-defense-2022-01-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), adding that the proposal “is not moving forward at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwPVz4"&gt;Before you say that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; the FAA wasn’t going to let a private company mount a frickin’ laser beam (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INFavIUmhcE"&gt;sorry, old reference&lt;/a&gt;) to their airplanes, you should know that we’re not exactly talking about the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/5/18530089/us-air-force-research-laboratory-shield-laser-weapons-system-test"&gt;high-energy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/8/4197316/navy-laser-weapon-deploying-2014-shoots-down-drone"&gt;solid state lasers&lt;/a&gt; that can literally blast things till they catch fire and/or explode — though the US military has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/21/2814046/airborne-laser-testbed-canceled-boneyard"&gt;certainly tested those sorts of lasers aboard large aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0enjc"&gt;No, &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2021-0775-0001"&gt;FedEx’s proposal&lt;/a&gt; was for a “Infrared Laser Countermeasure System,” a fancy name for what’s effectively a high-power laser pointer (with a sophisticated targeting system) that blinds incoming missiles before they hit. As &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/43895/fedex-wants-to-equip-airbus-a321s-with-anti-missile-laser-countermeasures"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, the US has been exploring ways to protect airliners from missile strikes for a while now, particularly given the proliferation of cheap shoulder launched surface-to-air missile systems, and those sorts of laser systems looked to be an effective but expensive option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YejT50"&gt;FedEx even tested out one of the infrared variety, Northrop Grumman’s “Guardian” pods, in 2006. Here’s a close-up of a Northrop Grumman infrared laser pod:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O47SXViJNglP0JPxGIacpBMaTUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178160/hero_an_10064.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northrop Grumman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Northrop Grumman’s website claims these systems “protect more than 1,500 aircraft, including large and small fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and tilt-rotor platforms.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7InRhz"&gt;But it doesn’t seem like any US commercial airplanes have installed the tech yet; the FAA’s proposal suggests that FedEx’s addition of a laser would have been “novel or unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDrk1y"&gt;It’s not clear &lt;em&gt;whose &lt;/em&gt;system FedEx was hoping to attach to its planes when it submitted its proposal in October 2019, why the FAA decided it should move forward this month, or why the FAA decided to suddenly stop it now — but it does seem like your FedEx packages won’t be protected by laser anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fixes issue with the Assistant’s white noise sound that had sparked user outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKIz1R4GJ1DJVhXh5Xftc4Xkxrg=/0x0:4990x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401323/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-9.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Nest customers are unhappy with Google’s changes.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZglav"&gt;Google offers many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16973646/google-home-white-noise-ambient-sounds-how-to"&gt;ambient sounds from the Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, including one for white noise that might help block out noise to make it easier to sleep or study. The company seemingly changed its white noise sound last week, and many expressed frustration with the update, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/15/google-home-white-noise/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But Google tells us it has fixed what it describes as an issue, and the sound should work like it used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83RWmD"&gt;“There was an issue impacting our white noise experience. It’s fixed now and working as it previously did,” Google spokesperson Robert Ferrara said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpYAqk"&gt;The change had been disruptive for a lot of people, as documented in &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84041"&gt;this Google Nest community thread&lt;/a&gt; which had more than 150 replies when we first published this story on Monday. Some described the changed white noise as &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/82562/highlight/true#M15135"&gt;quieter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/83999/highlight/true#M15354"&gt;sounding muffled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/82584/highlight/true#M15143"&gt;One person said&lt;/a&gt; their child has asked to use another white noise generator instead of a Google Nest Hub. &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84826/highlight/true#M15628"&gt;Another said&lt;/a&gt; their toddler has observed the change and wakes up during the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ornHRI"&gt;To help those that wanted the original white noise back before Google fixed it, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/s4b30o/white_noise_ambient_sound_has_changed/"&gt;a user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; uploaded a one-hour track of &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iqUdzp2fNZq_A0zrbeI1dUFVOgQegNt9"&gt;original one and longer versions of it to Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; that would have theoretically used as workarounds. Google also offers other ambient sounds, like forest sounds and rain sounds, and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7364558?hl=en"&gt;you can see the full list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWt5q8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 7:12PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Google saying the issue was fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google split with startups over antitrust bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mgX7d5hD1RylQChLoYJAF98gGA=/0x114:5023x3463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405968/1237547519.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Elizabeth Frantz-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wokii9"&gt;As the Senate Judiciary Committee inches towards passing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;legislation that could loosen Big Tech’s grasp on consumers&lt;/a&gt;, Big Tech is expectedly outraged. Both Apple and Google have written letters publicly opposing new pieces of legislation, while a coalition of smaller tech companies has voiced their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEN952"&gt;The outcry comes in response to two pieces of proposed legislation: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents Big Tech from favoring their services over others, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to promote competition on app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oN5xKr"&gt;Apple’s senior director of government affairs, Tim Powderly, penned a letter, viewed by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL), Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the panel’s ranking Republican, Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee (R-UT), criticizing the legislation. Powderly says the bills, particularly the Open App Markets Act, would be detrimental to the safety of the App Store, as it would allow users to sideload apps, also known as downloading an app from a third-party source. Since these apps exist outside of the Apple ecosystem, they aren’t subject to the same &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-security-overview-sec35dd877d0/web"&gt;safety and security standards&lt;/a&gt; that apps must meet to earn a spot on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eKpApl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cChANh"&gt;“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Powderly writes. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLt3Dx"&gt;Downloading an app from outside the App Store wouldn’t subject them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users choose the kinds of data (if any) that apps are allowed to track. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tim-cook-claims-sideloading-apps-would-destroy-security-and-privacy-of-ios/"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said&lt;/a&gt; sideloading “would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we’ve built into the App Store where we have privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency, where it forces people to get permission to track across apps.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi has spoken out against sideloading&lt;/a&gt; as well, stating that it “undermines security and puts people’s data at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OBO7"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple currently collects a 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on any in-app purchases on apps downloaded from its App Store. The company prevents developers from incorporating alternate payment processors for this very reason, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the prevailing issue behind the Epic v. Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885065/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-third-party-payment-options"&gt;Apple recently conceded to the Dutch government&lt;/a&gt; to allow dating app developers to include other payment options, however, the company says it will still take a commission from those purchases, and it’s unclear how much that commission will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GqMZTP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse” and “less relevant” products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6OJa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/"&gt;In its own post&lt;/a&gt;, Google made a similar case against the “legislation being debated in the House and Senate,” arguing it would not be able to offer the “best” services to consumers if the antitrust laws pass. Since the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would prevent Google from prioritizing its own services ahead of others, the company claims it may not be able to offer consumers the best online experience, as users may be swayed by other apps that apparently just aren’t as good as Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8AVll"&gt;The company says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse, less relevant, and less helpful versions of products like Google Search and Maps.” Google also claims it would prevent the company from integrating security features into its apps and services by default, such as its SafeBrowsing service and spam filters in Gmail and Chrome, which block pop-ups, viruses, and malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvQINa"&gt;“We believe that updating technology regulations in areas like privacy, AI, and protections for kids and families could provide real benefits. But breaking our products wouldn’t address any of these issues,” Kent Walker, the president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet explains. “Instead, it would eliminate helpful features, expose people to new privacy and security risks, and weaken America’s technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtGU9O"&gt;Like Apple, Google also charges developers a 15 to 30 percent commission on apps and in-app purchases. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;Dozens of states filed lawsuits against the company&lt;/a&gt; last year, citing that the practice violated antitrust policies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Epic Games also sued Google in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the company’s payment restrictions on the Play Store constitute a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="exa816"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTLa9I"&gt;But there are still several other voices, albeit a bit smaller than Apple and Google, voicing their support of the legislation. Companies including Wyze, Yelp, DuckDuckGo, and the Tor Project, &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;posted a letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Chairman Durbin and ranking Republican Grassley to vote “yes” on the American Innovation and Choice Online Act. The companies say that Big Tech’s dominance and “gatekeeper status” have prevented them “from competing on the merits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYeU3J"&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services; restrict the ability of competitors to interoperate on the platform; use non-public data to benefit the companies’ own services or products; make it impossible or complicated for users to change their default settings or services or uninstall apps,” the letter states. “These tactics not only harm competition, but also deprive consumers of the innovative offerings a vibrant market would yield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7XW71"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee passed a package of six similar antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, none of which have become law. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to review the bipartisan American Innovation and Choice Online act later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has a new plan to confront its ‘wildfire crisis’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN-CLIMATE-FIRE-WEATHER-COLORADO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7AwlRq4DaL794hZ0VbrcLXA_rsI=/0x0:3163x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405943/1237591072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;US President Joe Biden speaks with a fire victim as he tours a neighborhood destroyed by the Marshall Fire in Louisville, Colorado, January 7, 2022. - Authorities say the fast moving wildfire destroyed more than 1,000 homes | Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmn3DF"&gt;Federal authorities have a new plan to protect communities across the western US from increasingly explosive infernos by fighting fire with fire. In a shift from old-school firefighting strategies that attempted to stamp out naturally occurring blazes, the USDA and Forest Service will focus on thinning out forests to minimize “mega fires.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqyQPV"&gt;The agencies released a 10-year strategy today that includes &lt;a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fmg/nfmg/rp/silv/established/p2_thinning.html"&gt;removing trees&lt;/a&gt; and using “&lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/prescribed-fire"&gt;controlled burns&lt;/a&gt;” to reduce the amount of vegetation that feeds flames. The plan is to treat   up to 20 million more acres of national forest land than is currently managed, plus work with partners to employ the tactics on an additional 30 million acres on other federal, state, tribal, and private lands. All in all, it’ll take an estimated $50 billion to accomplish, the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-climate-science-health-business-8176e045e74d61736e4657073bcb1951"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The USDA did not immediately respond to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to verify that estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="fXutHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A “national emergency”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EiH46a"&gt;The US’s “wildfire crisis” is described as a “national emergency” in the newly released 10-year &lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Wildfire-Crisis-Implementation-Plan.pdf"&gt;implementation plan&lt;/a&gt;. Supersized blazes are increasingly devouring huge areas. California’s 2020 fire season was record-smashing; more than &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/"&gt;4.2 million acres&lt;/a&gt; burned that year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427494/california-wildfires-2020-record-most-acres-burned"&gt;compared to the previous record of nearly 1.9 million acres&lt;/a&gt; set in 2018. “Fire has always been a natural part of forest ecosystems, but the mega fires that we’ve been experiencing are unlike anything we’ve seen before,” Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) said during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pNJkXkY_QM"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; for the new wildfire plan in Arizona today. “Today’s fires — they burn hotter, and they burn longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5hjuN"&gt;They’re also far more destructive. The running five-year average number of homes and buildings destroyed by wildfires in the US has jumped four-fold, according to the USDA, from 2,873 in 2014 to 12,255 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p07CXx"&gt;Wildfires have grown more ferocious, according to the plan, because of climate change, which is warming and drying out landscapes and priming them to burn.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;More urban sprawl in fire-prone areas also plays a role. Notably, so does historical fire suppression strategies that helped turn today’s dry landscapes into tinderboxes full of fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ToKXb"&gt;Before European settlers arrived, some Native American tribes, like the Karuk Tribe in California, maintained a practice of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21507802/wildfire-2020-california-indigenous-native-american-indian-controlled-burn-fire"&gt;intentionally starting controlled blazes&lt;/a&gt;. The method reduced the amount of tinder on forest floors so that when uncontrolled fires sparked, they didn’t burn as intensely. California, the state that &lt;a href="https://headwaterseconomics.org/natural-hazards/structures-destroyed-by-wildfire/"&gt;loses the most&lt;/a&gt; structures to wildfires, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/burning-issue/california-tribes-get-green-light-for-cultural-burns/"&gt;recently passed measures&lt;/a&gt; that allow for more “cultural burns,” for which tribe members might have previously &lt;a href="https://karuktribeclimatechangeprojects.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/karuk-prescribed-fire-rpt_final-1.pdf"&gt;faced fines and criminal charges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zeJiG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We needed the jumpstart.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HlevxI"&gt;Now, authorities plan to expand similar practices to quell conflagrations. “We’re not talking about stopping fires. We’re talking about having that fire behave as it does its natural thing across the landscape,” Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said at today’s press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyk2ds"&gt;Their new efforts will be concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Colorado, California’s Sierra Nevadas, and the Southwest. They’ll home in on “high-risk” areas where wildfires pose the greatest threats to people. Less than 10 percent of fire-prone forests account for a whopping 80 percent of fire risk to communities, according to the USDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9s8PZ"&gt;The bipartisan infrastructure law passed last November will help the 10-year plan get off the ground with about $3 billion in badly needed funding. But that’s not even enough to cover a nearly &lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/gaoa/faqs"&gt;$6 billion backlog&lt;/a&gt; of deferred maintenance. “There just simply is not the resources being developed and allocated to the forest service to do everything we wanted to do,” Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said at the press conference today. “So we needed the jumpstart.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRKOtY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This comes as cell carriers, federal agencies, airlines, and airplane manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;struggle to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; on policies regarding how the rollout should be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlWmTF"&gt;Emirates’ announcement is one of the clearest about what’s being canceled. The airline says that it’s “suspending flights to the following US destinations from 19 January 2022 until further notice,” listing Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, Orlando, San Francisco, and Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1A1E5v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="837OGu"&gt;The airline will continue to fly to New York JFK, Los Angeles (LAX), and Washington, DC (IAD). Emirates says it’s “working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns” and that it hopes to start flying to the US again as soon as it’s able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbuBmU"&gt;More Asian airlines were also affected as the day progressed. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-scramble-rejig-schedules-amid-us-5g-rollout-concerns-2022-01-18/"&gt;Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt; that Taiwan’s China Airlines will reschedule some flights, while South Korea’s Korean Air Lines switched away from Boeing’s 777 and 747-8 aircraft on six flights to the US, and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific says it’s prepared to use different planes if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSGmYn"&gt;Airline operators in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;also warned&lt;/a&gt; that the rollout could cause “catastrophic disruption” to their flight schedules. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;According to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, the concern is that the C-band 5G signals could interfere with the radar altimeters used in some planes, creating a safety issue. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;our full explainer on the whole situation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H1s6Mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xFj9dm"&gt;ANA cites specific guidance from Boeing, saying that “Boeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft.” Japan Airlines also cites a notification from Boeing, saying that it was told that “5G signals for U.S. mobile phones, which will begin operating in the U.S. on January 19, 2022, may interfere with the radio wave altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHg4P8"&gt;Boeing didn’t respond immediately to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request to confirm that it had sent out an advisory. Its competitor, Airbus, said that it will be working “as part of a wider industry coalition” to “study the issue further and work toward solutions.” For information on aircraft limitations, it referred to &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-5g"&gt;the FAA’s statements on 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, where a statement from January 16th lists the airplane models that have been approved to land at some airports under low-visibility conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3837yY"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline#comments"&gt;both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would voluntarily delay 5G antenna upgrades near certain airports. The chairwoman for the Federal Communications Commission issued a statement saying it’s “essential that the FAA now complete” the process of assessing altimeter performance and the effect C-band 5G communication can have on it with “both care and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9vwZG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 19th, 3AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on additional airlines that have been affected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft addresses last week’s buggy Windows Updates that broke VPNs and rebooted servers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxtVkD8xycgQTchuCqOYvrQtVwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405577/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NackkG"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#2777"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; an out-of-band (OOB) update yesterday to fix some Windows issues caused by last week’s monthly patching cycle on Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8w4jm"&gt;The January 2022 updates that shipped last week included security patches and a fix for Japanese text appearance issues in Windows 11 (&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-11-2022-kb5009566-os-build-22000-434-eee797fa-5ee3-4501-aeec-db3bc73b2c7b"&gt;KB5009566&lt;/a&gt;) and Windows 10 (&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/january-11-2022-kb5009543-os-builds-19042-1466-19043-1466-and-19044-1466-b763552f-73bd-435a-b220-fc3e0bc9765b"&gt;KB5009543&lt;/a&gt;) — along with a secret payload of issues, including unexpected restarting of Domain Controllers and VPN connections using L2TP failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Wy9L"&gt;One of the major issues that came up during the week for IT admins included finding that Windows Server 2012 became stuck in a boot loop, while other versions suffered broken Windows VPN clients, and some hard drives appeared as RAW format (and unusable). Many IT Admins were forced to roll back the updates — leaving many servers vulnerable with none of last week’s security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEdQbt"&gt;The process is leaving some IT Admins frustrated and sharing grievances &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/s6ix86/update_on_windows_updates_breaking_your_domain/?sort=new"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the OOB update (an update separate from the usual timing that is downloaded and distributed manually by staff) would force them to first run last week’s buggy patches — risking some Domain Controllers to continuously reboot, loss of access to external drives formatted as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2012/1/16/2712061/microsoft-unveils-windows-8-refs"&gt;ReFS&lt;/a&gt; (Resilient File System), and broken VPN connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Co44N6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An out-of-band update has been released to address issues related to VPN connectivity, Windows Server Domain Controllers restarting, Virtual Machine start failures, and ReFS-formatted removeable media failing. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mx9Le4ZXcV"&gt;https://t.co/mx9Le4ZXcV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows Update (@WindowsUpdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUpdate/status/1483212333560172545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IeAUcE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with an IT Admin for a university, who was able to confirm they, too, had to roll back last Tuesday’s update because external ReFS drives had become incompatible — with no warning from Microsoft. Microsoft’s documents state that ReFS should only be used on fixed drives, so this department (and other IT admins &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/s5uans/the_sad_sad_state_of_windows_updates_almost/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;) had to migrate data before running the updates again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY5opw"&gt;Should the ReFS issue have not been addressed any sooner by Microsoft, they might have believed the drives were faulty, then tried reformatting to NTFS and losing the data (that might be a good idea anyway, as other posts Reddit shared accounts of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/s1y5pw/january_updates_refs_became_raw_for_database/"&gt;ReFS failing on them&lt;/a&gt; regardless of this update).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bgXh5"&gt;This OOB update is available to IT admins with access to Microsoft’s update catalog and can be loaded into Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) — but does not, as of yet, appear in the WSUS catalog, leaving Admins forced to manually download and load it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPCZen"&gt;An individual by the name of syshum on the sysadmin subreddit jokes: “To Microsoft the question is Why are you still using DomainControllers. You should be using Azure AD only.” There are reasons why many might believe there’s an uneven allocation of resources — subscription cloud services like Azure contribute more to the company’s constant revenue flow than a long-term supported Active Directory solution on-premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWcrYy"&gt;Thankfully, support for on-premise solutions isn’t gone yet. Cliff Fisher, Microsoft’s product manager for Active Directory, addressed the problems of patching the older Server 2012 R2, which erroneously reboots too fast to take the whole cumulative patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hn9AXA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A quick thread on patching with Windows Updates on downlevel platforms like 2012R2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two types of updates on OSes on the older servicing stack - a Monthly Rollup (MR) and a Security-Only (SO).&lt;/p&gt;— Cliff Fisher (@brdpoker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brdpoker/status/1483468179108106241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E26VtO"&gt;Some of these fixes are available now for Windows 11 and Windows 10 as an optional update if you go to Windows Update on your computer. As of writing, there is still no fix for Windows Server 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House warns ‘small percentage’ of people can’t order its rapid COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Administration’s Covid-19 Response" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7WtICOOKkmPYeWfnL-21_MIS1qY=/0x0:5418x3612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70405325/1364441499.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRtrEH"&gt;Nearly a month after President Joe Biden first announced that Americans would be able to order rapid at-home COVID-19 tests for free from the government, the administration’s website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;finally went live on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. But hours after the site’s launch, users struggled to place orders to homes or apartment buildings where other tenants may have already placed an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHQ35U"&gt;The extent of the problem is still unclear as of publication, but White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz said, “It’s a really small percentage and USPS will be sending our statement on this shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdOc8"&gt;Users trying to order tests to multiple-family homes and apartments seem to be experiencing this issue the most. Once a user enters their information into the form, they’re prompted with an error message that says their order could not be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY66aK"&gt;“Our records show that at-home COVID-19 tests have already been ordered for this address. We are unable to process duplicate orders for the same address,” the ordering site’s error page reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLO3CQ"&gt;Last week, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that users will be able to call a hotline to order tests if they are unable to access the website. “There will be free tests available for every household, and to promote broad access, the initial program will allow four free tests to be requested per residential address,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9lZj3M"&gt;The US government’s site to claim free COVID tests, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;started accepting orders a day before it was scheduled to&lt;/a&gt;, is drawing in a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of visitors — more than every other government page combined, according to &lt;a href="https://analytics.usa.gov"&gt;the government’s own analytics site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQ2QRA"&gt;Web traffic numbers change by the second, but at 1:32PM ET, when I ran the report to download real-time numbers for all governmental pages, &lt;a href="http://COVIDTests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; (along with its FAQ page and versions of the site in other languages) had 685,817 visitors. The visitor counts for the 3,853 other pages included in the report totaled 419,615. Traffic doesn’t seem to have dropped since then. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BoBQdKE3TBNrpq7MOyg3n88qRgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177347/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_11.29.05.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;At times, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://COVIDtests.gov" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;COVIDtests.gov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page had over 705,000 visitors.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bC4HT5"&gt;There have been concerns that the site wouldn’t be able to handle the load since it was announced. So far, though, it seems to be handling the rush — though it’s always possible we could see an even bigger wave of visitors on the site tomorrow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884217/free-covid-19-test-biden-500-million-january-19-usps"&gt;the date the general public was told it would go live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D1jKT"&gt;That’s not to say that things have been perfectly smooth. Several people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickySundt/status/1483521702315405315"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that living in an apartment building can cause issues, with some residents receiving an error message that tests had already been ordered for their address. As &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-government-at-home-covid-tests-e98c4a7a4ee340345a5786c4c407c5fb"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard to tell how widespread the issue is, and there have been conflicting reports on how to solve it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats unveil bill to ban online ‘surveillance advertising’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VJ7lpW"&gt;On Tuesday, Democrats introduced a new bill that would ban nearly all use of digital advertising targeting on ad markets hosted by platforms like Facebook, Google, and other data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGm3Z2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177323/Banning_Surveillance_Advertising_Act.pdf"&gt;The Banning Surveillance Advertising Act&lt;/a&gt; – sponsored by Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) – prohibits digital advertisers from targeting any ads to users. It makes some small exceptions, like allowing for “broad” location-based targeting. Contextual advertising, like ads that are specifically matched to online content, would be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Aq1Mv"&gt;“The ‘surveillance advertising’ business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting,” Eshoo, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in a Tuesday statement. “This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms. The surveillance advertising business model is broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S3rGSP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The surveillance advertising business model is broken”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1tmAs"&gt;If enacted, the bill would radically change Facebook and Google’s business models. For years, lawmakers have debated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;ways to regulate the tech industry&lt;/a&gt; on issues like privacy, disinformation, and content moderation. Eshoo and her co-sponsors argue that the tech industry’s current advertising models incentivize the spread of harmful content and encourage them to amplify damaging posts to keep users on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIJSnH"&gt;The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general with the authority to enforce the new rules for ad targeting. It also allows individual users to sue platforms like Facebook and Google if they break the law, granting up to $5,000 in relief per violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnQmyf"&gt;“Surveillance advertising is a predatory and invasive practice,” Sen. Booker said in a statement on Tuesday. “The hoarding of people’s personal data not only abuses privacy, but also drives the spread of misinformation, domestic extremism, racial division, and violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dviilJ"&gt;Since Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress last year, lawmakers have put out a number of new bills to regulate social media algorithms to address the spread of harmful content. Last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726290/malicious-algorithms-section-230-bill-eshoo-pallone-doyle-schakowsky-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;House Democrats unveiled a measure&lt;/a&gt; that would strip away a platform’s Section 230 liability protections if their algorithms were found to have recommended harmful content to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca0ej6"&gt;At Haugen’s first Senate hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;the leaks confirm&lt;/a&gt; “that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids’ online safety.” He continued, “we know it chooses the growth of its products over the well-being of our children.”&lt;/p&gt;
