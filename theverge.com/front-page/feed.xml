    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7FCha"&gt;Amazon just wrapped its fall devices event, and it was chock-full of news, including new Echo devices, new Ring products and services, and even a home assistant robot named Astro. It was a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GDJsz"&gt;We’ve recapped the biggest news of the show right here, including links to many of the &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; articles going into more detail about what Amazon announced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tc3kq7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22461285"&gt;Amazon’s Astro is the company’s new home robot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2n4tSO"&gt;Amazon revealed a home assistant robot, called Astro, which can help with home security monitoring, act as a mobile device, and more. It has a 10-inch touchscreen that can show a “face,” and it scoots around your house on wheels. You can request an invite to buy it as part of Amazon’s Day 1 Edition program, and it costs $999.99. The robot will begin shipping to selected customers later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s race to create the disappearing computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Unveils New Alexa-Driven Devices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BduiljwfA4IMOKeqkJeDx7bTxek=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921059/1171145260.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ambient computing is here; now what?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="n8cRtR"&gt;For his last column in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15686870/walt-mossberg-final-column-the-disappearing-computer"&gt;Walt Mossberg predicted that technology would fade into the background, and so-called “ambient computing” would become ubiquitous&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, we are well on our way — but what exactly that term means for how computers will work and how we’ll live is still very much up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZOywX"&gt;Many companies are working on some vision of ambient computing, but there’s nobody working harder to try to make the idea of ambient computing happen &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; than Amazon’s head of hardware, Dave Limp. How he’s building that future today is a case study in how Big Tech confounds our preconceived notions of how progress works. We expected AI to look like HAL 9000. Instead, it looks a lot more like a Hammacher Schlemmer catalog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tw2lWx"&gt;At Amazon’s yearly lollapalooza of gadget announcements, the company typically announces literally dozens of new Alexa-connected devices. Releasing so many different devices at such a heady clip makes a certain kind of sense: if computers are meant to be all around us, Amazon needs to produce as many different kinds of computers as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFIA4y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of HAL 9000, we’re getting Hammacher Schlemmer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ0KaE"&gt;This year, among the flood, Limp presented three devices that are paradigmatic of his vision for what he calls “ambient intelligence.” Subbing out the word “computer” for “intelligence” is a tell that he’s trying to change consumers’ thinking about how our digital lives will work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7fMF"&gt;Today, however, these three devices are limited to pushing the boundaries of — and our comfort levels with — what we expect out of smart homes. Critically, all three take part in a new kind of computing platform that is unlike what we’re used to seeing from Big Tech. It’s diffuse, dispersed, and sometimes difficult to comprehend.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixhcPU"&gt;The big one is Astro, a two-wheeled robot with a screen for a face that can trundle around your home and serve as a watchdog, assisted living companion, and (of course) beer delivery vehicle. There’s also Amazon Glow, a new kind of videoconferencing gadget that projects a play surface on a table, so your grandkids are less likely to wander off during a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f39Eyc7YQEmhyxI1MEMkrdLYyhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882962/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro home robot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FoSR9W"&gt;Finally, though it isn’t as weird, the new Echo Show 15 has the chance to make the idea of a true smart home family hub a reality by turning the Echo into a big digital picture frame that you can hang on your wall. That familiarity means it’s the one that’s likely to sell the most and therefore make the biggest impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKYxLX"&gt;Normally when we talk about gadgets, we talk about the operating systems on which they run. iPhones have iOS, Samsung phones have Android, Windows computers have, well, Windows. But the operating system on Amazon’s gadgets is almost beside the point — because the point is that the thing that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; matters is the Alexa ecosystem to which they’re connected. “I don’t really think about it as an operating system in the traditional sense,” Limp says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXJw1V"&gt;“We think about that as a framework that we internally call ambient intelligence,” Limp says. “It’s not one individual system. It is a lot of systems running in the cloud” and on the so-called “edge,” aka the gadgets you actually have in your house. To say that there’s such a thing as a single Alexa platform isn’t really accurate, Limp argues. It’s an old way of thinking. “Behind the scenes, we have this whole layer of software, literally, hundreds of different services, some on the edge, some in the cloud,” he argues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vpekR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t really think about it as an operating system in the traditional sense.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uObeKZ"&gt;More than any other tech journalist, I’ve cracked jokes about Apple’s “What’s a computer?” ad — the one that asks us to recontextualize how a new generation thinks about the iPad. But with Amazon’s ambient intelligence platform, it’s no longer a joke. The computer is both in the cloud and on the device, and the actual computing happens here, there, and everywhere — and as a consumer, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to locate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c50r5U"&gt;Some of it is and will continue to happen on “the edge.” Amazon promises to soon enable completely local processing of your voice on newer devices. Ring Alarm systems can be end-to-end encrypted, and the new one can be used without even sending the encrypted video to Amazon’s cloud. The Astro robot needs to do all of its navigation and recognition right on the device both for privacy and practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1McfT"&gt;But after that, it’s a messy melange of inputs, outputs, machine learning, and hunches (literally, Amazon calls its technology for predicting your commands “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G7F5F7K93GKSLC4F"&gt;hunches&lt;/a&gt;”). Limp says that as many as one out of four actions taken by Alexa devices today are proactive — they’re done by Alexa based on what it has learned about your desires instead of in response to a specific command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MFH4VNb7G5Uj2A5Ybb8E_u7yiMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883502/Amazon_Glow_Projected_Home_Display.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Echo Glow projector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WijIjU"&gt;In Alexa and its associated gadgets, Amazon has created a computing paradigm that is just as important as Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android. But because it’s dispersed among smart home gadgets and smart speakers instead of in monolithic screens that we engage with directly, it’s harder to pin down or describe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGUvCi"&gt;“We’re trying to bring this ambient intelligence and AI to places that the industry seems to have abandoned,” Limp says. Rather than try to take on the rest of Big Tech directly, Amazon has always (Fire phone aside) tried to go to places where there’s less competition. In doing so, it has carved out a lead in the smart home and voice assistant space with the Alexa platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cJjn"&gt;Also, in doing so, Amazon has courted controversy. The very nature of smart home gadgets means they’re going to have cameras, microphones, and other sensors. Every time Amazon announces a new kind of gadget, there’s an inevitable and often justified backlash of concern that it’s further eroding our privacy. Although the company has done lots of work to secure its devices and provide clear and strong protections, the backlash is unavoidable given the nature of the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3jIP3"&gt;Limp’s take is that a future where computers and sensors are everywhere is inevitable, so he’s trying to build them with safeguards in place. “I don’t imagine a world 10 years in our future where every house doesn’t have at least one robot,” he says. “I don’t anticipate a future where every house doesn’t have some sort of ambient intelligence in it. And so then the question is, what can you do to make sure that you get to that future, but you don’t end up with the Orwellian, dystopian version of that? For us, that means we have to kind of invent our way there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yVfR71"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why wouldn’t you want a customer to try a robot, if you can build it?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16903b"&gt;There is a kind of brazenness to some of Amazon’s gadgets. Last year, it announced (though it has yet to ship) a video drone that flies around inside your house. This year’s Astro robot is almost guaranteed to elicit a resounding “nope” from privacy advocates despite the company’s promises to safely handle sensitive data locally on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeE22H"&gt;“Talking about the industry as a whole, I think it’s not taking enough risk. Why wouldn’t you want a customer to try a robot if you can build it?” Limp asks. “Why wouldn’t you want to see a customer try a Glow and see if they do resonate with grandparents or a parent that’s on deployment or wherever they might be. I think our job is to invent like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4qIq0"&gt;Here’s the bind Amazon has made for itself: it’s building an ambient computing platform that is diffuse and difficult to pin down, but the things we justifiably demand from our computing platforms — things like privacy, security, and accountability — require answers that are specific and clear. Although, on paper, Amazon almost always has answers to the biggest privacy questions, it’s the questions that we don’t know to ask that are often the most troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI-caANyFkhRlftUAa-YVj8Ap1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883512/echo_show_15_media_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Show 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5sIPdq"&gt;Platforms are also about helping other people build upon them. A platform should create an economy of success around it, where other companies are able to build businesses. Given the proliferation of smart home gadgets, Amazon has certainly done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMDNdR"&gt;But most platforms also help us &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; things. I take videos with my phone, make music on my tablet, write blogs on my laptop, and build out spreadsheets on my desktop. Amazon’s platform is, at its core, about convenience and consumption. Alexa sets timers and answers questions, but it also plays music. There’s home security, sure, but there are also Kindle books, Prime TV, Amazon Music, and Kids Plus content. There’s a difference between entertainment and creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i4Tdv"&gt;Underlying all of this is the fact that Amazon is making this platform happen via the most Amazonian of mediums: retail. It’s building our ambient computing future with smart cameras, speakers, robots, picture frames, lightbulbs, and other gadgets. We have just started to figure out how to think about the societal implications of smartphones; now, we’ve got robots and teleconference board game systems for children. It’s all happening very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="D2k2H1"&gt;Amazon’s ambient intelligence platform is succeeding because it is less constrained by the computing paradigms of the past. It has, without a doubt, made our homes smarter and our lives more convenient. The disappearing computer can do a lot for us; now, the next question is what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are going to be able to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70ClVk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDNVUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AZ2 CPU knows your face</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSgB7IxpljEToPdcRVqyKz9QrL4=/99x0:1551x968/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921054/chrome_6FpHFOD0Qj.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AZ2 brings facial recognition to the new Echo Show&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZrFZrf"&gt;The announcement of Amazon’s new wall-mounted Echo Show 15 also revealed its new CPU that comes with some interesting (or potentially scary) applications. The AZ2 chip builds on the machine learning interface that premiered with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453205/amazon-az1-neural-edge-processor-echo-show-10-alexa-voice-on-device"&gt;AZ1&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed Amazon devices to better recognize your voice, but has extended this capability to facial recognition as well. This comes with Amazon’s new focus on what it calls “Ambient Intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6nVwV"&gt;Let's explain what the AZ2 does on paper before we dive into the implications of this hardware. The AZ2 is capable of 22 times the amount of operations per second compared to the AZ1, which means it can simultaneously process speech and facial recognition locally. The information the AZ2 learns about your face will be part of what Amazon is calling “Visual ID” and requires users to specifically enroll in this feature. This enables the Echo Show 15 to recognize you and display custom content based on your Alexa profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoMwQO"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the AZ2 is a neural edge processor, which means that it utilizes machine learning to cut down on the amount of data it needs to send or receive from the cloud. This has the benefit of not only reducing latency but also cutting back on the amount of data that gets stored on the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQem4k"&gt;While Amazon has made it remarkably easy to control, view, and edit the information it can access, there is something eerily dystopian about a machine that can automatically recognize you when you walk into a room. If you’re someone that gets annoyed whenever your Alexa accidentally recognizes your voice, you may want to skip enrolling in Visual ID.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWZITJ"&gt;Currently, the Echo Show 15 is the only piece of Amazon hardware that we know will include the AZ2. But just like the AZ1, you can expect it to become a keystone piece of technology in Amazon devices going forward.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMWUT4"&gt;For full details on some of the other devices that Amazon announced at its fall hardware event today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22690309/amazon-fall-hardware-event-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;check out our coverage of the event here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say hello to Astro, Alexa on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7dpf3bWovxrVtkCq25B9PgsALU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921026/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Astro home robot&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s long-awaited home robot is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uWyMCR"&gt;In the fall of 1962, TV-watching audiences were invited to meet the Jetsons, a space-dwelling, flying-car-driving family from the future and their dog, Astro. Today, Amazon wants you to meet a different Astro, one that’s not quite as fantastical or futuristic as the Jetsons, but actually available in our present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kguNTY"&gt;Amazon’s Astro is not a dog; instead, it’s the company’s long-rumored home assistant robot. Though Amazon denies taking inspiration for the name from &lt;em&gt;The Jetsons&lt;/em&gt;, it was hard to ignore the resemblance to a faithful pet when I got to see the Astro in action last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PkMmz"&gt;The Astro, which will initially cost $999.99 and available as a Day 1 Edition product that you can request an invite for the privilege of buying, is Amazon’s most ambitious in-home product yet. Amazon sees it as bringing together many different parts of the company — robotics, AI, home monitoring, cloud services — all into one device. Best described as the love child between a Roomba and an Echo Show smart display, the Astro is meant to be the next step in what Amazons believes to be the seemingly inevitable home robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H4TG3L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro is an attempt to combine a number of Amazon’s strengths&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duHyjP"&gt;Amazon claims the Astro can do a wide variety of things you might want from a home robot. It can map out your floor plan and obey commands to go to a specific room. It can recognize faces and deliver items to a specific person. It can play music and show you the weather and answer questions like any Echo smart display. It can be used for video calls, always keeping you in frame by literally following your movements. It can roam around your house when you aren’t home, making sure everything is okay. It can raise its periscope camera to show you whether you’ve turned the stove off. It can use third-party accessories to record data like blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCZCzw"&gt;But as ambitious as the Astro is, it still is very much a first cut at what a home assistant robot could be. It doesn’t have any arms or appendages; it can’t clean your floors; it can’t climb stairs; it can’t go outside of your home; and it probably can’t do a zillion other things I’m not thinking of at the moment. That’s part of the reason why Amazon is limiting its availability at launch — even after years of development, it still has a lot to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwFIZVGehrzFZPaiLR_o10astWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882955/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has a 10-inch touchscreen for a “face” and a wide array of sensors for eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nu5NSx"&gt;The Astro stands roughly two feet high and weighs about 20 pounds. Its main drive wheels are about 12 inches in diameter, large enough to clear door thresholds and move through carpet, while a single caster in the back helps it keep balanced. The Astro can zip along at a top speed of one meter per second and it has the ability to move in 360 degrees, forward, back, or any direction it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5QMQk"&gt;Inside the plastic-clad shell are five different motors: one for each drive wheel, one to raise and lower its periscope camera, and two to twist and tilt its “face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpzbH5"&gt;That face is effectively the screen lifted off an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got an array of sensors in its bezel, plus a standard 5-megapixel video calling camera. Most of the time, the screen displays two circles that behave as “eyes,” allowing you to understand what the Astro is doing or where it’s planning to go. It can also show some limited personality through these circles, contorting them into different shapes and angles, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/4/18250104/jibo-social-robot-server-shutdown-offline-dead"&gt;ill-fated Jibo’s expressions&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18523124/anki-drive-robot-toy-company-out-of-business-shutting-down"&gt;also-ill-fated Cozmo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0V5uSs"&gt;But those circles aren’t what the Astro uses to see you or its environment. It’s actual “eyes” are the variety of sensors and cameras packed into the base of the unit, things like ultrasonic sensors, time-of-flight cameras, and other imaging tools that let the robot know what’s around it and where it’s going. The Astro’s navigational tools are all inside of itself — there’s no need for special boundary markers or other external guidelines like some robot vacuums rely on — and it can tell when it’s about to head down a set of stairs or hit an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wuELuL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s race to create the disappearing computer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 15 is meant to hang on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Amazon marries Ring and Eero in a neat, white package","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vVEEzJ"&gt;In another similarity to a robot vacuum, the Astro will use these sensors to map out your home. You can label each room and adjust the boundaries in the Astro smartphone app. You can also set up specific “viewpoints” in your home that the robot will remember. From there, you can tell the Astro to go to a specific location either with a voice command or remotely through the app. Since the Astro can’t go up or down stairs, Amazon expects most people to place it on the main floor of their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icgHLn"&gt;Amazon says all of the processing and storage for these maps happens locally on the device and nothing is stored in the cloud. The Astro can only be paired to a single phone at a time — a security measure to help prevent unauthorized access or use. Similarly, its facial recognition data is also stored locally on the Astro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3NRb7I"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Astro demo clip|104104" data-volume-uuid="f75493661" data-volume-id="104104" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-34" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Inside the Astro are five different motors that allow it to move freely. | &lt;/em&gt;Animation: Amazon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UhwiLi"&gt;Between the sensors on the front of the robot are a couple of two-inch speakers. There’s also a passive resonator on the bottom to improve bass output. These can get quite loud when playing music, and since the Astro can literally follow you around and always move itself to the optimal position, you’re almost always going to be able to hear it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbqL3W"&gt;To make up for its diminutive size, the Astro has a 12-megapixel periscope camera that can raise up to 42 inches high, enough to see over a typical counter or table. This camera can be used for video calls or viewed through the accompanying phone app to see what’s happening inside your home when you’re not there. Surrounding the telescoping pole are the far-field mics that are used to pick up voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdq4gU"&gt;Around back is a small payload area, capable of carrying 4.4lbs (2kg) of cargo. By default, this area has an insert with two cupholders, but that can easily be swapped for a basic bin. Amazon envisions this area to be something third parties will take advantage of and for which they’ll design accessories. There’s a 15-watt USB-C port in the payload area that you can use to charge your phone, but the real utility of that is for accessories to plug into. Amazon’s executives spoke of a blood pressure cuff that will utilize it, though I wasn’t able to see that in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Znw2OvCFTyJD9q8kPp8RLHcLEEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882953/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 42-inch tall periscope camera allows the Astro to see over counters or other tall obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QclzNK"&gt;Like a robot vacuum (again), the Astro has a charging dock to which it can automatically attach itself. Charging the battery from zero to 100 takes about 45 minutes and it can go for about two hours of motion between charges. The Astro is designed to manage its battery life on its own — if it needs to recharge, it will just go to its dock by itself — but you can also tell it to do so by voice commands, through the touchscreen or in the app. The internal battery is located under the payload area and can be replaced when it no longer holds a charge, but it’s not designed to be changed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwZ4mV"&gt;The brains of the Astro are Qualcomm chips, not the Amazon-designed AZ2 processor that’s in the new Echo Show 15. The company says it used Qualcomm silicon here because of the Astro’s long development time. Like its maps, all of the Astro’s processing and movements happen locally — for privacy reasons but also for practicality. A cloud-based system wouldn’t be able to respond as quickly when the Astro needs to navigate around an unfamiliar obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g87IU5"&gt;For those interested, the Astro’s functionality is built on top of Fire OS and Linux. Amazon isn’t announcing an official Astro SDK today, but it says, “it’s easy to imagine a world where customers and developers can build unique capabilities that allow Astro to keep getting better over time, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVtSkP"&gt;The Astro’s design isn’t particularly beautiful or elegant — its utilitarian looks seem to be driven more by functionality than emotion. Amazon executives told me many different form factors and designs were tested and this shape is what they’ve landed on for now. But the design is not offensive or intimidating either, something that is important to get right if people are going to accept a largely autonomous robot in their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hmlMkk8vl0V-2p_lK38S4L8Ikc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882947/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s large wheels allow it to roll over most obstacles it might encounter in a home, like thresholds or power cables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W8c2b3"&gt;Trying to wrap your head around how all of those features and capabilities together might be useful in your home can be a challenge. Amazon envisions a handful of use cases — home security monitoring, remote elder care, and convenience — but it also readily admits that there could be more that just haven’t been found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttfkh9"&gt;That first use case is perhaps the most obvious one. The Astro can integrate with Ring’s security alarm system and function much like a Ring camera. It can capture video clips of events and send them to Ring’s cloud, and it can also automatically go to the site of a disturbance, if say a Ring motion or door sensor goes off when you’re not home. You can also program it to make autonomous patrols on a schedule, or direct it manually to go check something out through the Astro app. It’s not unlike the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456089"&gt;Ring Always Home Cam drone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBCMoH"&gt;Remote monitoring of your home is perhaps where the Astro’s periscope camera is most useful. You can tell it to raise the camera to see over a counter or obstacle and switch between the periscope camera and the camera mounted above the screen easily. Amazon’s execs were eager to tell me how useful it is to check if the oven was left on when you aren’t home. The Astro also has Alexa Guard integration, allowing it to alert you to sounds of a broken window or smoke alarm, just like an Echo speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FifZt_-Js2CtWZdeIan-SQmSyVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882946/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has sensors and cameras all around it help it navigate your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVq3eu6oBujSB0PNQRVuMC2ORPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882948/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s rear payload area is customizable — Amazon anticipates third-party companies will make accessories for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCB9zC"&gt;Amazon also envisions the Astro as being useful for remote monitoring of elderly relatives. Thanks to its ability to recognize faces, it can look for an elderly person and provide status notifications to their caregivers. Routines can be programmed where it will remind the person to take medication or check their blood pressure when they need to; the Astro’s ability to find them means that it can deliver this reminder even if they aren’t in the same room as it. The Astro will also be integrated into the new Alexa Together service, which provides access to an emergency helpline and support for fall detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoF34h"&gt;Lastly, Amazon sees the Astro as the next level of how Alexa can integrate into your home. Though the Astro’s wake word for voice commands is “Astro” (by default, it can be changed to Alexa, Echo, or Computer, but sadly not Artoo), the intelligence underpinning it all is Alexa. The Astro is effectively an Echo Show on wheels — you can ask it to follow you around as you do things; have it play music or podcasts while you’re doing chores; ask it to set reminders, timers, or take a photo; use it for video calling through Alexa’s calling service; and do all the other things an Echo Show can do. The software on the screen itself is effectively lifted right off the Echo Show, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6OPw"&gt;The Astro’s ability to recognize faces means it knows who it’s looking at and can play a greeting or turn on your favorite music when it sees you. It’s designed to learn your habits, so if you end up using it most of the time in the kitchen, it will park itself there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Xxgf"&gt;Amazon has also built more personality into the Astro than we’re used to from Alexa. It will move its body, change the shape of its eyes, and adjust its screen to express attention or emotions. You can ask it to do silly things like dance, and it moves around in a way that’s meant to make it easy to tell where it’s going, when it’s going to turn, and so on. Amazon says that beta testers claimed the Astro’s personality made it feel more like a part of their home than a smart speaker or other gadget; it will surely draw comparisons to the Jibo robot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;engendered similar attachments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbYJoDPvp1xr3btFgORYCKOfEoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882961/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro will turn its “head” to look at you or indicate where it’s going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NArSd4"&gt;For all of the things that the Astro can do, however, there’s a laundry list of things it can’t. In a demo of the device ahead of its official announcement, I was able to see Astro perform a variety of tasks, such as go to a specific room, find a particular person, take a photo, and so on. I was able to ask it to follow me around as I walked from one room to another; it had no trouble navigating around random obstacles that ended up in its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZpU1u"&gt;But as mentioned, it can’t go outside; it can’t go up or down stairs; it has no arms or appendages to open doors or cabinets; and it can’t help you move or get up if you’ve fallen down. Sure, it can deliver an ice cold beer to a specific person, but someone still has to get the beer out of the fridge and put it in the back of the Astro before telling it where to go. It can show you that the oven was left on, but it has no ability to press the buttons itself to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9eGTFh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro’s competition will be software assistants as much as other robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RYUTG"&gt;It also doesn’t do a lot of assistant-type things that software is already starting to handle. There’s no ability for it to answer your phone and deal with telemarketers (something Google Pixel phones are already doing) or have it work with your doctor’s office to schedule your next appointment. The Astro can tell you when someone’s rung the doorbell, but it can’t go ahead and sign for that package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoOzQ"&gt;Amazon, for its part, is clear-eyed about the Astro’s limitations. That’s part of the reason why it’s releasing it with a limited, invite-only system before launching it to the public. The company told me that things like robot arms and other appendages could certainly unlock many more capabilities, but right now the cost is too great to make them practical or accessible. There’s also the problem of what people will be comfortable with in their home at this stage — the Astro’s current design isn’t a huge leap from a robot vacuum, but add a bunch of R2-D2-like grabber arms and the ability to open doors and people might start getting uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2_KpgEqiXwOQtAqeWeOykAbjUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882959/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro uses the circles on its screen to express different emotions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OsQNTN"&gt;That’s why, as it functions right now, the Astro feels more like an artificial pet than a true robotic assistant. It can do some tricks, provide some entertainment, and help out a little bit here and there, but it’s far from the kind of robots that science fiction has conditioned us to expect. Even the Astro’s insistence on putting itself in the best position for you to see and hear it (a couple feet in front of you, screen tilted up toward you) is undeniably similar to a dog begging for some scratches behind the ears or a piece of jerky. It’s hard not to find the thing just a little bit endearing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKp1pR"&gt;Amazon is convinced that everyone will have a robot of some sort in their home in the next five to ten years. The Astro is the company’s attempt to get out ahead of the field, before it’s too crowded with competitors. (It used this exact same approach to great success with the Echo.) It’s also only the first of its attempts at putting a robot in your home, and given the company’s nearly endless resources, it doesn’t need the Astro to be a huge sales success to keep developing on this idea. The introductory price of $999.99 includes a six-month trial of Ring Protect Pro, though Amazon says its price will go up to $1449.99 once it reaches broader release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wMcoFF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many questions about the Astro remain unanswered for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdQ09j"&gt;The question for all of us then, is how much do we want to be testing Amazon’s ideas and experiments in our most intimate of spaces? The company has done a lot to mitigate privacy concerns with the Astro’s local processing, but it can’t possibly know every way someone will feel their personal space violated by a robot in their home until it’s already there. That’s why it needs to do larger-scale testing than it’s able to do in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F70vj"&gt;I’m also curious to see how it reacts and behaves in a real-world environment, outside of Amazon’s beta testers. How’s it going to function when a toddler decides it’d be fun to sit on the back and ride it? How will a real-life dog deal with this robotic interloper in its domain? Can it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;avoid dog poop&lt;/a&gt;? How useful will it actually be when it’s limited to just one floor of a multistory home? How much convenience can it really add beyond the smart speakers that are already in my home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XYo9jo"&gt;Those answers will have to wait until we’re able to spend more time with the Astro and push its capabilities first hand. Until then, we’ll have to be content with dreams of robotic dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa Together wants to help you care for family remotely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y9S7otrxHr2GEdvl-6rPN1W2BcI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921006/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtRQQc"&gt;Amazon is announcing a new subscription service called Alexa Together today during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa"&gt;invite-only fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s new $19.99 per month service offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;the same features as the free Alexa Care Hub&lt;/a&gt; and will eventually replace it as Amazon’s tool for caring for family members remotely in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbkMma"&gt;Like Care Hub, Alexa Together can notify you when a family member uses their Alexa device, offer a feed of interactions they had with the assistant throughout the day, and function as a quick way to get a hold of each other in the case of an emergency. Alexa Together adds new emergency features like hands-free access to an “urgent response emergency helpline” and compatibility with fall detection devices from ATS and Vayyar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xaQVwL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s elder care features are no longer free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mt334"&gt;Caregivers with access to Alexa Together will have the optional ability to set reminders, manage shopping lists, and set up music services without having to access an Alexa device in person. Amazon also says it’ll expand the number of accounts that can manage Alexa Together next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8ZJzU"&gt;These features are a solid expansion of what Care Hub was already capable of, making the service more than just a tool for elderly family members but anyone who could benefit from extra caregiving help. Alexa Together costs $19.99 per month, and Amazon says new customers will get a six-month free trial to Alexa Together. Former Care Hub users will get a whole year for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If5KhX"&gt;Alongside today’s announcement, Amazon also introduced new updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456114"&gt;its line of Ring alarms and doorbells&lt;/a&gt; and an even larger wall-mounted version of its Alexa with a screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22457544"&gt;the Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOIh5s"&gt;Alexa Together will be available later this year for $19.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s mobile gaming platform spreads to Spain, Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7lrirv1yrViJ1Jua4QUVZ6GSi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920882/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWFDh5"&gt;It has only been a few months since Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;confirmed plans to include games as part of its subscription&lt;/a&gt;, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642946/netflix-mobile-games-in-app-android-users-poland-stranger-things-1984-3"&gt;an initial test in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the streamer is opening its selection of Android titles to customers in Spain and Italy. While Netflix has had some promotional titles before, with tie-ins recently revealed for everything from Oculus VR to PC gamers on Steam, this experience is built directly into its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xD1bzl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The rollout continues! Today members in Spain and Italy will see Netflix Games available on their Android phones. We’re still in the early stages of our gaming experience, however here’s a snapshot of what’s new… &lt;a href="https://t.co/LHaQJmCBvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LHaQJmCBvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjsHzj"&gt;The Netflix games test is only available on Android at the moment, while tweets from its localized accounts for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixES/status/1442856482127634435"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixIT/status/1442866775851372545"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; show it still works by pushing customers to the Google Play Store. There, they can install the titles that are playable as part of their normal subscription. After they’re installed, players can launch them from the main Netflix app, but it’s not like watching a movie since players are shifted over to the game’s own app. There are five games to choose from: &lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops, Card Blast, Teeter Up, Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaOO5h"&gt;One important change is visible already in the screenshots, as the gaming section has received its own section in the bottom navigation bar, which should make it more visible to people simply browsing the app. When they announced the effort in July, Netflix execs said, “Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost, similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRrCNd"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; indicates the company is “still in the early stages of our gaming experience,” without revealing anything about when it might be available in the US. If you’re desperate for hints, the most telling factor is probably that it’s in English.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Package alerts come to Ring’s wired doorbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5va60agsnJ_vGfFz97cVGR84Co0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920872/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Ring Pro 2 video doorbell (pictured) and the Ring Video Doorbell (2020) will now be able to tell you when a package is on your doorstep.  | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K03c9F"&gt;Ring is bringing package alerts to its Ring video doorbells, and it’s about time, too. This is a much-requested feature that’s already found on most of its competitors’ camera doorbell offerings. When the main selling point for a product is that it will deter porch pirates, it’s kind of important to be able to keep a virtual eye on those packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjgaN"&gt;The pings that will tell you when a package is on your porch will start rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;Ring Pro 2&lt;/a&gt; and Ring Video Doorbell (2020) in the US and internationally today and should arrive on other buzzers next year. But this still doesn’t address a big issue with most of Ring’s doorbells; the cameras’ wide viewing angles often don’t pick up the spot where the package is left. Only the Pro 2 has a head-to-toe view for seeing the whole porch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_knnMUMfe3Pm_OPE5jz4MY5cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884281/Package_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Pro 2 is the only Ring doorbell that can show you a head-to-toe view, which is useful for seeing packages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trcpZF"&gt;Along with playing catch-up in the industry it invented, Ring has a new trick up its sleeve: Custom Event Alerts. This feature lets you create your own alert based on the information you want to know. For example, is the garage door open? Is the car in the driveway? Is the front door shut? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59NRh"&gt;Custom Event Alerts will only be available on the Spotlight Cam Battery and are scheduled to arrive later this year. Both Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts require a subscription to a Ring Protect plan (starting at $3 a month or $30 a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6jvQh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring custom alerts demo video|104114" data-volume-uuid="48c385801" data-volume-id="104114" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-242" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BapcvU"&gt;Ring says the custom alerts work by having you train your camera on the two states you want it to recognize, such as when a garage door is left open or closed or when a car is in the driveway or not. The computer vision algorithm processes images of the scene in the cloud and sends an alert when it sees a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcIUPc"&gt;“You can literally build your own detector — there’s so many neat things to do with it,” said Ring founder Jamie Siminoff in an interview. He taught a camera to tell him when his HVAC compressor was on or off. “I was having problems with the outdoor compressor and was able to train it to tell me if the fan was spinning or if it wasn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXn7G4dSx_TbWjhPm6cLT7e3fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884280/Custom_Event_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature on the Ring Spotlight Cam lets you create custom event alerts to tell you when the state of something changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRKzK"&gt;The camera uses computer vision and machine learning to figure out the difference between the two states and should then recognize when that state changes and alert you to it. This type of AI-powered motion detection is the next arms race in the smart home. Companies are competing to find the best way to send their users fewer annoying alerts in favor of more relevant, useful ones from their smart home cameras. And what’s more relevant than an alert you create yourself and custom design for your home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv2cGw"&gt;To date, Ring has been behind here, partly hampered by a reliance on battery-powered tech, which energy-intensive smart alerts can swamp. Category leaders such as Arlo and Google Nest already offer package, people, animal, and vehicle alerts, but Ring could well be the first to let you create your own. This is a bold claim, however, and we won’t know if it holds up until we’ve been able to test it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now you can pay Ring $99 a month to watch your cameras for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4qZGku1xSFDdeBciiSVszUkr2s=/0x467:1779x1653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920858/Virtual_Security_Guard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring has announced a new service that has professional security agents monitor your Ring cameras&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mNbFyJ"&gt;Ring revealed its latest ambitious security product today: real-life people watching over your home. Taking the concept of monitored security to the next level, Ring’s Virtual Security Guard is a new subscription service that lets agents at a professional monitoring center respond to specific motion alerts on any outdoor Ring camera and take action for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y8Ns9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/virtual-security-guard-a-new-service-offering-peace-of-mind-when-you-are-out-of-range"&gt;Virtual Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; requires a Ring Alarm home security system to work (Gen 1, 2, or Pro) and costs $99 per month on top of a $20 monthly Ring Protect Plus subscription for professional monitoring. It works with any of Ring’s wired, outdoor cameras (including all the wired doorbells, the Spotlight Cam, Stick-up Cam and the floodlight cameras). You choose which are monitored through the Ring app, and when a camera detects a motion event while the Ring Alarm is armed, the monitoring company is alerted and responds based on what it sees. The agent will use a series of guidelines and your preferences to tailor a response and can use features like the camera’s two-way talk to communicate with a visitor, turn on the siren, or send emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xf-t4_5GZ8JOVtZ6HGj5dNMAja4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882517/20210820_lifestyle_professional_monitoring_adobestock_304603525_rgb_1x1__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you trust Ring to watch your security cameras for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXo22s"&gt;If the agent sees someone they think is up to no good, they will first use two-way talk to let the person know they are being monitored and ask them to leave. If they don’t go, the agent will sound the siren in the camera and continue monitoring while dispatching emergency services. At this stage, they also call and text the property owner with a link to the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7eEaM"&gt;You can only enroll outdoor cameras at launch for obvious privacy concerns. If you try to add a camera that’s inside, the monitoring company is supposed to stop monitoring it until it’s reconfigured outside, Ring tells us. Of course, this relies on the human agent to flag the issue, a potential stumbling block for privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkod9o"&gt;The Virtual Security Guard isn’t a form of visual verification for the Ring Alarm system (which is when the monitoring service can view a live feed on your cameras if something triggers one of your alarm sensors) as it can’t monitor any cameras when the alarm is triggered. Its sole purpose is to monitor when motion is detected on an outdoor camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjgHO"&gt;“Visual verification is something we’ve looked at, and we’ll continue to look at. This is a level up from visual verification, which is really about once something’s happened,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in an interview ahead of the announcement. “This is much more proactive; this is a virtual security guard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMjE6J"&gt;The monitoring service can only access a live view once motion is triggered and while the Ring Alarm is armed; agents can’t view camera feeds when the alarm is disarmed, and they can’t download, share, or save videos. In the Ring app, there will be a tag on any video that a human has reviewed. At launch, the service will be offered by &lt;a href="https://www.rrms.com/"&gt;Rapid Response&lt;/a&gt;, the professional monitoring company the Ring Alarm uses but will expand to additional providers at hopefully lower prices, says Ring. Virtual Security Guard is available in the US for &lt;a href="https://www.ring.com/virtual-security-guard-real-time-monitoring"&gt;early access, starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj2Err"&gt;The concept here is to take the onus of responding to your camera’s motion alerts off you and put it on to someone else. If your Ring Alarm sends you a notification at 2AM that there’s a person out back, chances are, you’re going to miss it, or if you see it, you’re never getting back to sleep. Now, the Virtual Security Guard can view the event that triggered the alert, and if it turns out to be a non-event, you get to stay tucked up in dreamland. “Even with the advances in AI and machine learning, I’m not sure how far they can go to make sure you always get the only alert that matters and wakes you up,” said Siminoff. “This way, you have that extra line of defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BbDhF1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the Ring app, there will be a tag on any video that a human has reviewed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLKIXT"&gt;It can also work for peace of mind as you arrive or leave your home. Ring president Leila Rouhi described a scenario she experienced at her home while testing out the service. There was a commotion in her front yard when she was arriving home, and her dog ran off after another dog. “There was a little bit of mayhem in front of my door, and the agent checked in and asked, ‘Hey, is everything okay? Is there anything we can do for you?’” she explained. “Thankfully, the situation was under control, but it felt really nice to know that, in an emergency situation, if something bad were happening, there is somebody who is looking out for you and can take action if you need them to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0DuZG"&gt;Ring’s track record when it comes to Ring employees viewing camera footage is spotty at best. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon"&gt;A 2019 report&lt;/a&gt; indicated that Ring let employees watch and share unencrypted customer videos with each other. However, privacy advocate Pam Dixon, Executive Director of the &lt;a href="https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/"&gt;World Privacy Forum&lt;/a&gt;, has reviewed the Virtual Security Guard service and told me that she believes Ring and Amazon have exceeded best practices here. “They’re doing background checks for the monitoring agents, and I am also reassured by the bias training they are giving them,” she said. “I don’t know of another company that does that. That gives me real comfort that this product will not peddle bias, which is a big plus.” Ring also told her that it will be doing regular audits of the monitoring agents. “I feel comfortable with this,” she continued. “But if it were cameras inside the home, that would be a different situation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6ozoD"&gt;Dixon pointed out that there are many groups of vulnerable people for whom tools like Virtual Security Guard will be an excellent resource. “We work with a lot of victims of domestic violence — and a lot of survivors invest heavily in security tools so they can be notified when someone breaches their safety.” She also sees its usefulness when you’re away on vacation, for example, and don’t want to be constantly monitoring your phone. But for most people, a virtual security guard for your home is probably overkill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAt9oO"&gt;And it looks like Ring is aware of this, and is targeting Virtual Security Guard more towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which are already using Ring Alarm products to secure their premises, according to the company. “Hiring an in-person security guard is not something that’s possible or sustainable for a lot of small businesses,” she said. “With Virtual Security Guard, you have that level of service at a much more affordable price.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon marries Ring and Eero in a neat, white package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdTDemyzT-rSDJHnVLpd_48b3_0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920854/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_keypad_credenza_rgb_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro is the latest generation of Ring’s home security system and features a built-in Eero mesh Wi-Fi router.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;With 24/7 internet backup and on-board video processing, too, this Z-wave alarm system is now a serious smart home hub&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KPq06A"&gt;Smart home company Ring has announced the third generation of its popular budget Ring Alarm home security product. The Ring Alarm Pro is a single device combining Ring’s security system with an Eero Wi-Fi router, 24/7 internet backup, and local processing and storage for Ring cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdwFu4"&gt;This all-in-one device is designed to offer physical home security as the base station for Ring Alarm’s Z-wave sensors and digital security through the cybersecurity features Eero offers in its Wi-Fi system. It also acts as a smart home hub for compatible third-party gadgets, such as door locks, thermostats, and smoke alarms. And, with a new processor on board, the Ring Alarm Pro can connect to Ring cameras to process and store videos locally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2c6jRhqG4gixZfHHmB18Ik6oBic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881783/20210414_image_device_alarmprobasestation_wht_tabletop_angled_1500x1500_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larger than the original Ring Alarm, the Alarm Pro is 6.63 x 6.63 x 1.56 inches and is powered by a USB-C connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6tPYDT"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro costs $249.99 for just the base station or $299.99 for an eight-piece security kit including contact sensors, a motion detector, a keypad, and a Z-wave range extender. Ring claims you will be able to swap out an existing Ring Alarm Base station without having to reconnect all your devices, and pre-orders start today in the US only, with shipping beginning November 3rd. The second-generation Ring Alarm is sticking around at $199 for a five-piece kit for those who don’t need these new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wf2qSj"&gt;Along with the new hardware come new subscription packages. A new Ring Protect Pro subscription for $20 a month (or $200 a year) is designed to use with the new Ring Alarm Pro. This is a new level of Ring Protect that includes the local storage feature, a new 24/7 backup internet option, and an Eero Secure subscription, in addition to the cloud storage, professional monitoring, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454582/amazon-alexa-guard-plus-subscription-service-security-price-release-date"&gt;Alexa Guard Plus&lt;/a&gt; that is part of the existing Ring Protect plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ZN9Ilk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is really the first time we’ve all rolled up our sleeves and developed a product together.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7fdos"&gt;Ring also announced a portable version of Ring Alarm Pro designed for job sites, such as construction sites. The system leverages the cellular connectivity and Eero Wi-Fi capabilities to keep cameras and sensors online in places where you might not have internet up and running yet. It can be set up at one site and then dismantled, packed in a specially designed case and taken to the next job. &lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/ring-jobsite-security-a-new-way-to-secure-job-sites"&gt;The Ring Jobsite Security Kit &lt;/a&gt;starts at $399.99 and can be pre-ordered at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FHomeDepot.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22692073%2Fring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomeDepot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brV8oY"&gt;This consolidation of services for your home — security and internet connectivity — is a smart move by Amazon, the parent company of both Ring and Eero. And it is notable as the first time Amazon has brought two of its smart home brands together into one piece of hardware. “This is really the first time we’ve all rolled up our sleeves and developed a product together,” Nick Weaver, CEO, and co-founder of Eero, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Simplifying and converging things makes a lot of sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM1Jjw"&gt;For Ring, the move was designed around providing security for the digital side of our lives, as well as the physical. “Historically, we’ve been focused on the physical security of our neighbors (customers),” explained Jamie Siminoff, founder of Ring. “But we’ve seen over the last few years how so many things have moved to digital — everything from money to pictures. We felt that, as a company whose mission is to make your neighborhood safe, just securing the physical things was no longer enough; we had to add the digital as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="lrn1d0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776125"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5gXSA"&gt;There is a lot going on with this product. And while the words “smart home hub” were conspicuously absent from the pre-announcement conversations I had with Ring and Eero on the Ring Alarm Pro, this is a white plastic box packed with smart home communication protocols that lets your devices talk to each other. Its specs include two Ethernet ports, Bluetooth for setup, a Z-wave radio, 2.4 GHz and 5Ghz Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, LTE, and a 902-928 MHz Radio (it’s Sidewalk-ready, but it’s not turned on). So, yeah, it’s a smart home hub — and a powerful one at that, although somewhat hampered by being firmly locked into the Ring / Amazon Alexa ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvaRKO"&gt;The headline feature here is the built-in Eero router, as this is the first time Eero has put its TrueMesh technology in any non-Eero branded device. It’s not the first time we’ve seen a router in a smart home hub (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098872/samsung-connect-home-wifi-router-announced-smartthings-price-release-date"&gt;Samsung’s Connect Smart Wi-Fi system&lt;/a&gt; combined mesh Wi-Fi with a SmartThings Hub). Still, the idea of merging a router and smart home / security hub helps simplify things for many everyday consumers — the clear target audience for Ring and Eero here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHjtXq"&gt;Case in point, the Eero inside the Ring Alarm Pro is an Eero 6, not the more advanced Eero Pro 6. It’s capable of speeds up to 900Mbps over 1,500 square feet, but those speeds drop to around 500Mbps if you add more Eero nodes to create a mesh. The Pro offers gigabit speeds throughout the network, and while you can add Pro nodes to the Ring Alarm Pro network, the Eero in the Alarm Pro will need to be the main gateway connected to your ISP. “But if you’re getting less than 500Mbps [from your ISP], there’s really no benefit to having the Pro 6,” Weaver explained. “Unless you have a lot of devices on your network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2Fj8A"&gt;From a security perspective, the Eero Secure service included in the $20 a month Ring Protect Pro Plan adds a layer of digital security to your network. “With Eero Secure, we’re basically ensuring that all the devices on your home network are staying safe and secure. So, you know, it blocks different attacks, helps you enable parental controls, and protects you from phishing,” said Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJf5wZ"&gt;As an alarm system, the Ring Alarm base station does everything the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215231/ring-alarm-second-generation-update-preorder-features-emergency"&gt;previous generation does&lt;/a&gt;. It can connect to Ring’s sensors and compatible third-party Z-wave devices to monitor your home for intrusion, water leaks, and fire — and send emergency police, fire and medical response in the event of an incident if you pay for 24/7 professional monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hxrvf"&gt;The most significant change on the Ring side is that the new base station can now be a hub for Ring’s cameras. A new processor in the device enables local processing of videos from Ring cameras via a service called Ring Edge. “With local processing, we can do edge-based computer vision processing,” explained Mike Harris, COO of Ring. “We’ve got a whole ton of ideas that we want to put this thing to work for.” Edge-based processing means the data is processed locally rather than being sent to the cloud, helping increase speed and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhRWKk-EbfOT6M67TwXjjT0uBlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881786/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_secuirtysystem_livingroom_rgb_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro base station connects to Z-wave security sensors in your home.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB50NE"&gt;Ring Edge also enables local storage of video through a removable microSD card (a 64GB that can hold around 47 hours of clips is included; you can use cards up to 512GB). It is part of the $20 per month Ring Protect Pro plan, so it’s not a workaround to avoid paying a monthly fee to view your camera feeds. However, it can help take the pressure off your bandwidth, and you can pick and choose which of your cameras stay local and which use the cloud to store and process video. Local videos will not be stored in the cloud, but as long as the microSD card is installed, you can view them in the Ring app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADNQSo"&gt;Local storage does not unlock the option of 24/7 video recording, however. That’s a feature other security camera systems offer but has been missing from Ring since the beginning. Ring Alarm Pro’s local storage is compatible with all of Ring’s current cameras except the Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) and Stick Up Cam (1st Gen). It won’t be available on Ring Video Doorbell 4 and Floodlight Cam Wired Pro at launch, but the company says it will be coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0n1TF"&gt;There are also improvements around the Ring Alarm’s backup capability. The Ring Alarm Pro works with a new Ring Power Pack to provide longer uptime, and its high-speed LTE connection can keep your whole Wi-Fi network online, not just your Alarm Pro. The Power Pack has an 8550mAh battery rated at 10.8V and 92.34Wh and costs $129.99. It connects to the Pro via USB-C to extend its battery life by up to eight hours. You can daisy chain up to four power packs to keep your system up and running for a little over two days. Ring says the Ring Alarm Pro only works with its power packs, so you won’t be able to use a third-party USB-C battery instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0undLFOJR1nrsXjMpgq2INw9-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881788/20210521_image_device_alarmprobasestation_powerpack_wht_front_stacked_1500x1500_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s new Power Packs connect via USB-C to the Ring Alarm Pro base station to get you an additional 8 hours of battery-back-up when the power goes down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lv9FIH"&gt;The built-in, high-speed LTE backup for your entire Wi-Fi system is perhaps the most interesting feature here. “The cellular backup went from LTE that was useful for the local connection for backing up your alarm devices to a high-speed connection that can back up basically everything on your Wi-Fi network,” explained Harris. It’s fast enough to keep your internet connection up and running in the event of a power outage and / or internet outage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0R9iW6"&gt;The Ring Protect Pro plan includes up to 3GB of cellular data per month, with the option of extra data for $3 per gigabyte. It’s capable of keeping your entire Eero network online if you want, but within the Ring and Eero apps, you can designate which devices you want to stay online, so you don’t inadvertently eat up all that expensive data because your internet went down while you were streaming Netflix in 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE1DBx"&gt;This type of built-in redundancy can be handy on a daily basis to alleviate cries of pain from your kid’s bedroom when a power blip kicks them out of their latest Fortnite battle or prevent your Zoom call from dropping at that crucial moment. But it could really come into its own in an emergency situation, such as an evacuation due to a hurricane or wildfire. Knowing you can check in on your battery-powered security cameras and still stream live and recorded video for at least two days after power and internet have gone down (assuming cellular networks are still up) is a compelling use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23VHdW"&gt;Viewed as a whole, the Ring Alarm Pro is a big leap forward in the smart home security space. While we’ve seen smart security systems that offer smart home features from several companies, such as Abode, Simplisafe, Vivint, and ADT, this product takes the concept of smart home security to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPogXE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Viewed as a whole, the Ring Alarm Pro is a big leap forward in the smart home security space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4R3VP"&gt;But for homes that don’t need or want a professionally monitored security system, this is overkill. And there’s no easy way to separate the features here: everything is bundled into that Ring Protect Pro plan. If you already have a powerful mesh Wi-Fi network setup and don’t turn on the Eero in the device, then you lose access to that 24/7 backup internet feature, as well as the online protections, as it’s only available for devices connected to the built-in Eero network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLKHl7"&gt;For the smart home user, there is also a glaring piece of the puzzle missing: Zigbee. Unlike in the other Eero gateway devices, there is no Zigbee chip for enabling smart home devices to connect to your Amazon Alexa smart home system. The Ring Alarm Pro does have Zigbee on board — it’s been in the Ring Alarm since its first iteration. But it’s not turned on, and there is no support for OpenThread. “We may enable Zigbee on Ring Alarm Pro in the future,” says the company. “If a customer wants Zigbee Smart Home Hub or Thread support today, they can add an Eero 6 router or any Eero Pro 6 device to their network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaQ2Ip"&gt;We’re also concerned about managing all these new features through the already bloated, confusing, and very slow Ring app (seeing as Ring launched an app called Rapid Ring to more quickly access your camera feed, it’s clear the company knows this is an issue). While the Wi-Fi management stays separately in the excellent Eero app — everything else is routed through Ring, which could be an exercise in frustration. If there ever was a moment for Ring to launch a fully-featured web interface, it is now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gemldY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard not to see the Ring Alarm Pro as a compelling product at a good price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yqNIO"&gt;It’s hard not to see the Ring Alarm Pro as a compelling product at a good price. It neatly wraps up some of the key aspects of the modern, connected home into an easy-to-use package. It does lock you into the Amazon / Ring / Eero world, but with the coming of Matter, that may not be as much of an issue as it once was. Ring wouldn’t confirm its participation in Matter and the Ring Alarm Pro, but Harris did say that Ring is “definitely part of all of those conversations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAXkPC"&gt;This is also a big move for Amazon, consolidating its disparate smart home brands into a cohesive hardware package and connecting them by more than just the company’s Alexa voice assistant. From Ring’s perspective, it makes a lot of sense to have a reliable Wi-Fi router in its hardware. Keeping its Wi-Fi cameras connected to a strong enough signal in customers’ homes has been a major challenge for the company from day one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hid2VU"&gt;For an initial outlay of $250 and monthly costs of $20 covering professional monitoring, digital security, and internet backup, we see a lot of value here. How much that value is worth in the real world will have to wait until we’re able to get some first-hand experience with the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwNeXb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is the best Chromebook for midrange shoppers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Best Chromebook for midrange shopepers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pvusIr"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 looks a lot nicer than its sub-$400 price might indicate. It’s built to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, but also has a smooth soft-touch texture that’s pleasant to hold. Add a sleek backlit keyboard, a physical webcam shutter, and front-facing speakers, and you’ve got a chassis with hallmarks of a much more expensive device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y79cZK"&gt;You get some other perks as well. The Flex 5 has one of the better keyboards I’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook at a midrange price point. It also has a useful port selection including a microSD reader and a USB-C port on each side, as well as a crisp 1920 x 1080 touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD2vyD"&gt;The one caveat is that the Flex 5 has somewhat disappointing battery life, averaging just over five and a half hours in our testing. If you’ll be using the device while you’re out and about, you’ll want to make sure you bring the 45W charger with you. &lt;/p&gt;
