    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9Fdq2cbCOno63VPkrLW_l1q9i4=/0x114:3722x2595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062458/51637033819_8899737def_o.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BFPCCc"&gt;SpaceX is launching another crew to space this weekend, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-month-long stay in orbit. Traveling inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, the crew will get an early start on their mission, with liftoff scheduled for 2:21AM ET on October 31st out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5T1RE"&gt;The mission is called Crew-3, and it will carry NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. This will be the first trip to space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari — the mission’s commander. For Marshburn, this will be his third flight to space, and for each of his missions, he’s flown on a different vehicle. His first flight was on the Space Shuttle and his second flight was on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. Now he’ll get to experience the Crew Dragon, which the astronauts have nicknamed “Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erkIUc"&gt;Crew-3 is SpaceX’s third operational crewed flight for NASA as part of the space agency’s Commercial Crew Program — an initiative to use private vehicles to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As part of its initial contract with NASA, SpaceX is slated to perform up to six crewed flights for the agency, with two flights tentatively scheduled for next year. However, NASA recently indicated it is already thinking of how to transport astronauts beyond those initial missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rkf4Sp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUrHY9"&gt;While this is SpaceX’s third operational mission, it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit on the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. In order to prove the Crew Dragon’s safety for NASA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. That first successful test flight paved the way for SpaceX to start doing routine flights with Crew Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmXRG8"&gt;And in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX launched a crewed flight called Inspiration4&lt;/a&gt; that carried four non-NASA astronauts to orbit. Touted as an all-civilian crew, the passengers included a tech billionaire — who paid for the trip — a childhood cancer survivor, a professor, and an engineer. The foursome, who stayed in orbit for just three days, used the launch as a way to raise charity for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. It was SpaceX’s first truly private human spaceflight mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkObwH"&gt;Though Inspiration4 wasn’t a NASA mission, SpaceX learned a few things from that flight that will help with the upcoming Crew-3 trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pih5I7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NUMBER ONE PROBLEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="POENO3"&gt;The Crew Dragon that flew the Inspiration4 flight operated pretty smoothly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681339/spacex-inspiration4-crew-return-earth-splashdown"&gt;except for one key element&lt;/a&gt; inside the spacecraft: the toilet. This week, SpaceX revealed that a tube in the toilet that transports urine into a storage tank came unglued. This caused urine to spray into the toilet’s fan system instead and pool under the floor. It wasn’t really a problem during the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaRu5"&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back,” William Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of flight. “We got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor, and we saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DeEBBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFcVb6"&gt;After seeing this, SpaceX worried that the same problem might be happening on the Crew Dragon used for Crew-2, which is currently docked with the International Space Station. Sure enough, the astronauts on the space station went inside that Crew Dragon and found similar urine contamination under the floor of the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hFNFEZz19ju3KBbqe8cZrij2VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966250/51137531971_c3db77a39c_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the toilet inside the Crew Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsOEbW"&gt;The main concern with this pooling is that it’s not just urine collecting under the floor; SpaceX adds a compound to the urine called Oxone, which removes the ammonia from the liquid to help get rid of odor and prevent bacteria from growing. But SpaceX became worried that the mixture of Oxone and urine in the floor could actually corrode the spacecraft itself. The company did tests that involved combining the urine and Oxone mixture with aluminum — the primary metal used to make Crew Dragon — inside a chamber that simulated the same temperature and humidity on board the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5I071"&gt;The toilet issue was more of a problem on Inspiration4, since the crew spent their entire mission inside Crew Dragon, using the bathroom for multiple days, leading to more potential corrosion. Most of SpaceX’s other Crew Dragon missions send people straight to the International Space Station, so astronauts are typically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only using the toilet before docking. Also SpaceX claims that the aluminum alloy it uses on Crew Dragon is “very insensitive” to corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMn9zN"&gt;SpaceX opted to fix the toilet issue anyway by making the toilet an “all-welded structure” so that there are no longer any parts or tubes that can come unglued. That way no unwanted liquids will cause any trouble again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IgarsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SIX-MONTH STAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3WYsrg"&gt;Crew-3 is set to take off from SpaceX’s launch site LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The crew will then spend a little less than a full day in orbit before rendezvousing with the International Space Station. Crew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously with the ISS, but the astronauts can jump in during the process if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5u8doCKF4fPM69k5Iljy1QZ4VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966270/51634067771_6e46bf9d92_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon, at the company’s LC-39A launch site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="agdKd7"&gt;Once Crew-3 arrives, there will be a changing of the guard. The four Crew-2 astronauts already on board the space station will greet the incoming astronauts and get them settled. Then in mid-November, the Crew-2 members will climb into their own Crew Dragon and return back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPXkLz"&gt;As for the Crew-3 astronauts, they’ll be on board the ISS for six months, scheduled to come back sometime in the spring of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7AaTft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-3 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will take off on Sunday, October 31st, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWQqcV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 2:21AM / San Francisco: 11:21PM / London: 7:21AM / Berlin: 8:21AM / Moscow: 9:21AM / New Delhi: 11:51AM / Beijing: 2:21PM / Tokyo: 3:21PM / Melbourne: 5:21PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geralt fights giant monsters, and Jaskier befriends rats in new Witcher season 2 trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5PDuBW28YSEzQbw5Z3WdVIpmNE=/285x0:1938x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062441/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_10.02.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfZ6Hx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX6e6ZLNmtA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; has gotten its official, full-length, real trailer today, giving the best look yet at the monsters, magic, and mayhem that await Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill), Ciri (Freya Allan), and Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra) when the show arrives on Netflix on December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SST9dg"&gt;The new trailer teases a lot more about what to expect from the upcoming second season, including the upcoming war with the Nilfgaardian Empire, Ciri’s training to become a witcher, Geralt’s usual monster hunting, and the long-awaited return of everyone’s favorite bard, Jaskier (Joey Batey).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-crTYTOwhfbd2fvV4S6qiP4E8F8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966537/W_202_Unit_01821_RT20210913_4450_f7e3m6.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oeoeIt"&gt;It’s also the latest salvo in Netflix’s marketing bombardment for the show, which has so far included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;the teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;first look clips and behind-the-scene videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;brief Twitter teases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;the release date announcement&lt;/a&gt;. It’s no wonder that Netflix is going all-in on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season, though — the first season was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of its most popular series ever&lt;/a&gt; (even if it’s since been surpassed by other shows like &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwY9qh"&gt;The expanded &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe isn’t stopping with season 2, either. Netflix has already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;prequel anime film, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/25/22692068/netflix-tudum-season-3-anime-film-kids-family-series"&gt;announced a third season of the main series&lt;/a&gt;, a second anime film, and a family-friendly series set in the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India will get this $87 JioPhone Next instead of the Pixel 6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mm3IS7wIeZ_bGX__tklWV6kXoxI=/0x197:720x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062385/jiophone_next_blue_edition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new JioPhone Next is a collaboration between Google and Indian telecom Jio Platforms. | Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlzir3"&gt;Google and Indian telecom company Jio Platforms finally unveiled their budget smartphone for India on Friday, the JioPhone Next. The phone is designed as an affordable 4G device to serve “the unique needs of the Indian consumer,” Android India engineering lead Ram Papatla said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f5mRA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-india-3042428/"&gt;India won’t be getting&lt;/a&gt; Google’s new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, and those phones’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;premium prices&lt;/a&gt; put them out of reach of many smartphone consumers in the country. But Google and Jio have designed this new device as a more affordable 4G option. It’s priced at 1,999 Indian rupees, or $87, and is available at Jio Mart retailers in India or &lt;a href="https://www.jio.com/jiophone-next/specifications"&gt;on Jio’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0eJsl"&gt;The JioPhone runs Pragati OS, which Google says is an optimized version of Android, and can access apps in the Play Store. The device has read-aloud and language translation for on-screen text, a camera with India-centric Snapchat Lenses, and embedded voice-first features that support 10 different languages spoken in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4GaAJ"&gt;“Among the many rich features of JioPhone Next, the one that has impressed me the most — and one that will empower common Indians the most and take their digital journeys to the next level — is its contribution to India’s linguistic integration. India’s unique strength is our linguistic diversity,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms. “Those Indians who might not be able to read content in English or in their language can get it translated, and even read out, in their own language on this smart device.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyvRem"&gt;The phone has a 5.45-inch HD plus Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display, a 60Hz refresh rate, a 13-megapixel rear camera with support for HDR, an 8-megapixel autofocus front camera, a 3,500mAh battery, a Qualcomm quad-core QM-215 chipset, with 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable storage. It’s dual-SIM capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iblSns"&gt;The JioPhone Next will be available beginning November 4th, which is the first day of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8X2Yg"&gt;Google and Jio announced their collaboration on a budget smartphone in 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google providing a $4.5 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in the telecom company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Friday that the JioPhone Next was “inspired by the belief that everyone in India should benefit from the opportunities the internet creates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcUDyf"&gt;India passed the US as the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/25207/countries-with-the-highest-number-of-smartphone-users/"&gt;second-largest smartphone market&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, with more than 400 million smartphone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkALRg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cricket Wireless removes speed caps from several plans and offers 5G to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SPAIN-TELECOM-WMC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfQs7GcvbqyYi3yy4Rxla4kgcNQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062348/1233713968.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzij4E"&gt;Cricket Wireless suddenly has several more options if you’re looking for access to 5G on a prepaid wireless plan. That’s because starting today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fthe-cricket-connection%2Fsubscriber-milestone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will offer nationwide 5G access across all of its plans&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397001/cricket-wireless-5g-samsung-att"&gt;launched a year ago with support for only one device&lt;/a&gt; and only on its more expensive unlimited plans. Cricket Wireless also revealed it’s added 2 million customers in the last two years and is now serving some 12.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzFH24"&gt;The other big change for Cricket Wireless is removing an 8Mbps speed cap on its cheaper $30, $40, and $55 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fcell-phone-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;. How much bandwidth Cricket Wireless can reliably provide — using AT&amp;amp;T’s network — after the caps go away is something we’ll only find out as people try it out. Reading the fine print at the bottom of the announcement points us to Cricket’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fmap.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coverage map&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lists of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cricketwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fgreat-big-network%2F5g-compatible-phones.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22752383%2Fcricket-wireless-5g-att-mvno-speed-limit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;compatible 5G devices&lt;/a&gt;. It also points out that the $55 per month plan still carries a stipulation that “Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnyUSw"&gt;Of course, the benefits customers see from 5G, no matter which wireless carriers they use, have been pretty disappointing so far. With the changes, now you can potentially get 5G access for as little as $25 per month, per line, on a plan with four phone lines. And with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to expand the reach of its mid-band 5G connections over the next couple of years&lt;/a&gt;, even if things aren’t significantly faster for you right now, that could change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s new pro laptops right the wrongs of the past half decade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1T949o"&gt;Let’s start simply: the new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max chips are incredible — the fastest laptops we’ve ever tested in some tasks, with some of the longest battery life we’ve ever seen. Apple’s big bet on moving away from Intel CPUs and AMD GPUs in favor of its own Apple Silicon chips is paying off in meaningful ways, and if you can afford one of these machines, you will be very happy with them. They’re great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQBber"&gt;That said, the new MacBook Pros are not without their quirks, and the Mac software ecosystem is still catching up to Apple Silicon in general and Apple’s pro hardware GPU ideas in particular. So things aren’t quite as simple as our first impression of the MacBook Air with an M1 chip last year — depending on your needs and the tools you use, the Mac software ecosystem might not let you actually get the most out of these machines for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR96Q7"&gt;But make no mistake: the performance Apple has delivered with these machines combined with the battery life we’ve seen in our tests means that there’s a new standard in the industry — one that Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and every other laptop maker will be hard-pressed to reach anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4wYkT4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834286"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="tzzpM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nktvm9VipSbg-OXh6bRe6D_G1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965897/akrales_211028_4820_0523.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Pro 16 (left) and 14 have bright Mini LED displays that support Apple’s ProMotion 120Hz high refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qz1Ars"&gt;We reviewed three of the new MacBook Pros: a $4,399 16-inch model with an M1 Max processor with 32 GPU cores, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage; and 16- and 14-inch models with M1 Pros with 16-core GPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that list for $3,099 and $2,899 respectively. These are expensive computers from the jump: even the base model 14-inch starts at $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0wt43"&gt;The first thing you’re going to notice after you take a deep breath and spend the money is that these new MacBook Pros are much more substantial than the outgoing models. They’re bigger and heavier than previous MacBook Pros, and they are more squared off. The 16-inch is even just a little thicker than the older 16-inch MacBook Pro. Surprisingly, the extra thickness is mostly in the display — the actual body is only ever so slightly thicker than my old 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro, but you can really see it in the lid because it no longer tapers at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHZMWY"&gt;This is good news. Apple has made so many compromises in the name of thinness for so long that it was about time for the pendulum to swing back, and the extra thickness allows for better cooling and the return of some useful ports. On the right side, you’ve got a Thunderbolt 4 port, an HDMI port, and a full-size SDXC slot; on the left side, you’ve got two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a MagSafe power connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XW1Zrh"&gt;The ports are wonderful, and I’m glad they’re back. A few people on our video team said the SD card slot is enough of a reason to upgrade all by itself. But be warned that the ports aren’t top-spec: it’s an HDMI 2.0 port, not 2.1, and the SD card slot is only UHS-II, not the faster UHS-III or SD Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A side profile of the MacBook Pro 16 showing its full-size SD card slot, Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, and HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiNwvEfKeYRv7wxhPp-iD1CHHtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965874/akrales_211027_4820_0121.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now departing Dongletown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1q3ONclBy-y1_pfbExaQRZSNPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965886/akrales_211027_4820_0310.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro 16 can only fast charge with a 140-watt or higher charging brick connected to its MagSafe port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPQM9"&gt;So yes, the ports are definitely more convenient, and totally fine for most situations, but there are still reasons to visit dongletown. For example, macOS Monterey now supports variable refresh rate external displays using a Vesa standard called Adaptive-Sync, but Apple tells me you’ll need a Thunderbolt to DisplayPort dongle for that. I also ran into a strange bug where sending audio out over HDMI resulted in stuttering video and glitchy audio, which Apple says it is looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA57lx"&gt;The MagSafe 3 connector is great, a true classic. It’s strong enough to drag the MacBook Pro along a desk if you pull it straight, but instantly disconnects if it’s yanked at an angle. I missed it terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah0lIm"&gt;The confusion arises at the other end of the MagSafe cable, which is USB-C. You can charge all of these machines over USB-C using any of the ports, and you can fast charge the 14-inch MacBook Pro using a 100-watt USB-C adapter and a USB-C cable that supports that much power. But you can only fast-charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro using the Magsafe connector connected to a 140-watt-or-higher power brick — MagSafe is the only port that supports the newest high-power USB-C PD standard. The other ports do not. What’s more, there’s no indicator anywhere that you’re fast charging, so you just have to plug in and hope for the best. At this point, “plug in and hope for the best” is the unofficial USB-C slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybkfPq"&gt;USB-C charging is overall one of the most confusing parts of the entire confusing USB-C ecosystem, and it appears Apple is using MagSafe as a way around it — the power adapters are still interchangeable, but you’ll definitely know if your cable supports fast charging because there’s a MagSafe connector on it. It’s smart, but after years of USB-C nonsense, it’s also just funny we’re back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWDKt8"&gt;Lastly, there’s the keyboard, which is blessedly drama-free. Apple finally shed the hapless Touch Bar, added full-height function keys, and restrained itself from trying to reinvent anything else. It feels like every other scissor-switch Apple keyboard I’m used to, which is welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUQkM8NMRqv5OHmXMCuIDgqk24U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965883/akrales_211027_4820_0244.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro’s display can reach up to 1,600 nits of brightness, but that’s localized to only HDR content. The rest of the time, the screen has a more standard 500 nits peak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Alv8cS"&gt;The displays in these new MacBook Pros are also all-new, and they are terrific. In fact, I like looking at these displays far more than I like looking at Apple’s own $5,000 Pro Display XDR. But as with the rest of the new MacBook Pros, there is complexity involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lUiHC"&gt;First, there’s the notch, which houses a 1080p webcam, the camera LED, the TrueTone light sensor, and the ambient light sensor at the top of the display. But to me, rather than thinking of the notch eating into the display, I think of the display getting larger except in that one spot. The MacBook Pro effectively has a 16:10 display with a little extra bit at the top where the menu bar and the notch live. You stop noticing it after just a few minutes, just like you stopped noticing the iPhone notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojoHG"&gt;If you hate the notch, there are already free utilities to black out the menu bar and hide it, and you’ll have the exact same display experience as any previous MacBook. So we promise: the notch is not worth overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xev9vn"&gt;That said, it can be a little odd in practice. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778"&gt;already videos of weirdo notch bugs&lt;/a&gt;, which feels like what happens with every new iPhone notch — it takes a minute for apps to catch up. We are not too worried about it, overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiIiI9"&gt;Now, would it have gone down easier if Apple had added Face ID to the MacBook Pro? Yes, but at least there’s Touch ID, which is very fast on these machines. Would the notch have gone down easier if the webcam was as good as an iPhone front camera, instead of just, like, pretty good? Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6GA62"&gt;Is it also strange that Apple is leaning into display notches as branding elements on both the MacBook and iPhone, allowing them to be distinctively Apple products without having to put logos anywhere? That seems clearer than ever, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notch on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFde5UyfBxFRamE7rmfu9q2Hv5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948752/pesposito_170722_4803_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You stop seeing the notch after a day, just like the iPhone’s notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lqmtO7"&gt;This display is way more interesting than the notch, though. It’s now a Mini LED screen, which means the backlight is composed of ten thousand tiny LEDs, grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones. That means blacks can get really black on this display — up to a million to one contrast ratio, just like an OLED screen. (When you black out the notch, it’s really black — gone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC0uX6"&gt;And just as we found with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Mini LED display on the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, that backlight still has limitations — if you go looking for something called blooming, where there’s a little halo around bright elements on an otherwise black screen, you’ll find it. But you have to go looking for it — in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYtvehF9-Z8"&gt;YouTube torture test&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the backlight chasing this little square around the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txfHO6"&gt;If you’re watching a movie, you might see a little blooming when the controls come up over black, especially if you’re looking at the display off-axis. We got some questions about whether closed captions would cause blooming when watching a video, and the answer is it’s a non-issue: YouTube captions display over a gray box anyway, and Apple TV and Netflix captions mostly display over the video itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ENLloE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peak brightness of 1,600 nits is limited to HDR content only; the rest of the screen will peak at 500 nits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE17e"&gt;Apple made a big deal about how bright this display can get — it’s an XDR display, just like the Pro Display XDR. And just like the Pro Display XDR, it can reach a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, with a sustained brightness of 1,000 nits. But it’s not quite what you think: the display mostly runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbjJTN"&gt;Out of the box, the new MacBook Pros are set to a display profile called Apple XDR Display, which allows it to hit that 1,600-nit peak brightness, but only when viewing HDR content. The rest of the system is the same as every other MacBook Pro and runs at a max of 500 nits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA5TuF"&gt;If you have a newer iPhone, you already know what this looks like: you open a photo, and it brightens up. That’s more or less what’s going on with this display: when you have HDR content, it can get a lot brighter and hit that 1,600-nit maximum, but everything else is still SDR, and displays at a maximum of 500 nits. In fact, if you choose the standard Apple Display profile and limit the whole system to 500 nits, you won’t be able to tell the difference until you open an app or play a video that calls for HDR. I asked Apple about this; the company confirmed that the XDR system is content-dependent and designed to run at 500 nits for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3iumm"&gt;The good part is that all of this works really well: HDR video works in every app I tried, including YouTube in Chrome and Safari, and it looks terrifically bright with great colors and saturation. The HDR brightness levels even follow the content around the screen seamlessly, showcasing that Mini LED backlight in action. On a technical level, this display is extremely impressive and way more seamless than any HDR support we’ve seen on the Windows side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHTbzN"&gt;The bad part is that Apple’s marketing is confusing, and functionally this is a 500-nit display that can reach much higher brightness levels with the right content, not a 1,000-nit display, which is what a lot of people are taking away from that spec line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkjqWs"&gt;The upshot of all this is that most Mac users will find this display to be mostly familiar with some meaningful upgrades, but if you’re a Windows person using one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;1,000-nit laptops available in that ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t expect to sear your eyeballs off with this thing in most situations. We did a quick test working outside and it was fine, but if that specific spec is important to you, you’ll have to go look at one of these in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6x9rwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ProMotion high refresh rate is only barely perceptible in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZkB35"&gt;The last bit of display nerdery is ProMotion, Apple’s variable refresh rate system that lets the display run at anything from 24 to 120Hz. But I could only just barely see the improvement that 120Hz offers in normal, non-gaming use, and only when really looking. It’s just less obvious when it’s not a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu3Ydt"&gt;All in all, this display looks great, and a little minor blooming is a fine tradeoff for these black levels. Again, I think this display looks better than Apple’s Pro Display XDR, which has fewer dimming zones, more blooming, and off-axis color and brightness shifts that our team really doesn’t like. This display has none of those issues: it’s bright, accurate even, and generally a pleasure to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5Hqe"&gt;Lastly, the speakers on these new MacBook Pros are terrific. The first thing we did with these when we got them was open up a video to check out the new displays, but the first thing we &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; was that the speakers are so good. They are clear and crisp, with some actual low-end from four woofers, and they get super loud. It’s impressive — and while the 14-inch speakers are really good, the 16-inch models in particular have the best speakers we’ve ever heard on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ws07o80wpykku6lndDXgqmmuMVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965876/akrales_211027_4820_0151.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thicker and heavier designs for this year’s models are welcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uYb3Tu"&gt;I’ll just cut to the chase: for content creation and creative work, these are the most powerful laptops we’ve ever tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbp4rW"&gt;The basic M1-family chip design is easy enough to understand, even though it’s a new kind of chip architecture compared to x86, since the fundamental parts are all the same. Apple has three kinds of processor cores — efficiency, performance, and GPU — and all the M1 chips are different combinations of those exact same cores with unified memory between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRF975"&gt;For example: the 13-inch MacBook Pro we tested last year had a regular M1 with four efficiency cores, four high-performance cores, and eight GPU cores. The M1 Pro and M1 Max change that around a little, with two efficiency cores and up to eight high-performance cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acqXzi"&gt;The really big difference is in GPUs: the regular M1 has up to an eight-core GPU, while the M1 Pro has up to a 16-core GPU, and the M1 Max is available in 24- and 36-core setups. Again, those GPU cores are the same on all the chips — you just get more of them as you go up the range, along with things like faster memory with higher total limits and additional specialized video encoders. (The M1 Max machines have a little toggle for something called “high power” mode in system settings; Apple told me that simply allows the fan to spin faster for better cooling.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybfdnH"&gt;And… it turns out that adding a bunch of cores and specialized video encoders makes these chips incredibly fast for creative work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18gFET"&gt;The synthetic benchmarks we ran were extremely impressive. The M1 Max got a &lt;em&gt;gigantic &lt;/em&gt;score on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which tests live playback and export performance at 4K and 8K — beating Nvidia’s RTX 3080 and AMD’s 5900HX. The only computers that even come close are &lt;em&gt;desktops&lt;/em&gt; that use vastly more power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing 1,170 result in the PugetBench for Adobe Premiere Pro with the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 1,072 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 1,000 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 872 for the Alienware X17 R1, and 538 for the ROG Strix G15 Advantage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-qZ92lwhSx_fGzXpFviAT2z5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966211/Bench2___PugetBench_Premiere.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PugetBench for Premiere Pro test results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqGaWN"&gt;You simply will not find better Adobe Premiere performance from any AMD or Nvidia  laptops on today’s market. This system is generating performance in a tiny laptop chassis that, in the past, we’ve only seen from huge desktop machines with enormous power supplies. And it’s doing that even when it’s &lt;em&gt;unplugged&lt;/em&gt;: when we ran all these benchmarks on battery, we didn’t see a difference in scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB7ncG"&gt;When it comes to Cinebench, as well as Geekbench and other tests that stress the CPU, the M1 Max and the M1 Pro are neck and neck, since they have the same 10-core CPU block. Where the scores start to diverge is on tasks that leverage the GPU, like our export test, PugetBench, Geekbench Compute, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 12,368 score in Cinebench R23 multi-core 30-minute loop test for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,363 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 12,316 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 8,500 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019, and 7,729 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEh_t4NJk9Q2ftQ3Pnurkt16pXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966216/Bench3___Cinebench_R23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even when running long benchmarks, like this 30-minute Cinebench test, the MacBook Pro’s fans rarely spun up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sZyDpX"&gt;This makes sense, since the M1 Max has the same CPU block as the M1 Pro with more GPU cores and higher memory bandwidth. But it underscores the primary question that should be on your mind if you’re deciding whether to buy the Pro or the Max: how much GPU performance do you need? Things will be the same for an office workload or anything CPU-bound, but the Max has a clear advantage if you have specific GPU-optimized workloads. (You’ll take a battery life hit for those extra GPU cores, though — I’ll come back to that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zP0j2E"&gt;Of course, synthetic benchmarks only tell part of the story, so to see how well a laptop performs a real-world task, we ran an export of the same five-minute, 33-second 4K video clip in Adobe Premiere Pro. I also gave the machines to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior video director Alix Diaconis to edit and use them for a week to see how they worked for our real video production needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyKmaP"&gt;In that setting, these MacBooks were the fastest laptops we’ve ever seen. The 16-inch with the M1 Max was more than twice as fast as any previous MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bar graph showing a 1 minute 46 second time to export a 5 minute 33 second 4K video from Premiere Pro on the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, 2 minutes 50 seconds for the 14-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 2 minutes 51 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro, 3 minutes 38 seconds for the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021, 5 minutes 28 seconds for the 13-inch MacBook Pro M1, 7 minutes 6 seconds for the Razer Blade 14 2021, and 7 minutes 52 seconds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnLBFYB068GVRlQdKgjyLM4Wl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966220/Bench1___Premiere_4k_export_test.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro models put up the fastest times in our export test we’ve ever recorded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iMfIAs"&gt;It’s not just the export speeds, either. Here’s what Alix had to say about working with them in Premiere Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jV88Kc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premiere ran smoothly with 4K footage — on both the 14-inch and 16-inch M1 Pro machines, I could play back the timeline at full resolution at 2x speed. But to no surprise, when I added graphics and adjustment layers with color, Premiere started dropping frames. It was minor, but after 20 seconds a frame or two would drop. There was also a short but noticeable lag from hitting the spacebar to the timeline actually playing. It was about one second, as if the computer was thinking before it played. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYJs0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall, the editing experience was very similar to my regular work machine, a 27-inch iMac from 2019 with an eight-core Intel Core i9, 64GB of RAM, and a Radeon Pro 575x graphics card; the M1 Pro machines were actually choppier during 2x timeline playback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5daH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the M1 Max with 32 GPU cores, there was no lag between hitting the spacebar and playing, and Premiere ran noticeably smoother than my iMac or the M1 Pro laptops. Scrubbing through the timeline was great — I didn’t notice it drop a frame until 3.5 hours in of editing, which is very impressive. It did slow down with big graphics, though.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJBml"&gt;The big caveat about all this performance is that you need software optimized to take advantage of it, and we’re still in the middle of the Apple Silicon transition. For example, Adobe’s software isn’t nearly as optimized as Apple’s. Final Cut Pro is heavily optimized for these chips, and it was &lt;em&gt;over 10 minutes faster&lt;/em&gt; than Premiere Pro exporting a 14-minute 4K clip in ProRes 422.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uytM0s"&gt;Although parts of Adobe’s flagship creative software suite have been partially updated for Apple Silicon — Apple even pre-installed Premiere Pro on our review units — some important apps are not yet updated. This was underlined sharply by an After Effects update that arrived in the middle of our testing, which enabled better multi-core acceleration. After Effects is still an Intel app, which runs in the Rosetta emulation mode on these machines, but the update allowed the app to light up all 10 CPU cores and all 32 GPU cores, cutting export times on our test from 4:29 to… 41 seconds. (It also substantially sped up performance on our Intel-based Mac Pro, which is nice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h8mvN"&gt;That kind of performance increase is worth real money — it’s the kind of thing that lets our team &lt;em&gt;do more than they could with other machines&lt;/em&gt; because they aren’t spending so much time waiting around for things to export. And as we’ve seen, Adobe’s software isn’t even as heavily optimized as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Liv54d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The performance increase is the kind of thing that lets our team do more than they could before, simply because of how much time is saved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kf1wTV"&gt;In short: the performance improvements on unoptimized software are notable; on heavily optimized software, they’re incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbb2A"&gt;There’s another category of apps that haven’t (and may never be) fully optimized to take advantage of Apple’s GPUs: gaming. The M1 Pro and the M1 Max are groundbreaking chips, but they’re also built to do creative work really, really well — they haven’t made the MacBook Pros into serious gaming laptops. We ran the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark on the three units we have at its highest settings at 1920 x 1200. The M1 Max averaged 84fps on that benchmark, which is good, but it’s also the exact score we got from the Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 3060 chip, so it’s not beating Nvidia’s top guns. We’ve also seen much better from AMD’s GPUs: the Strix G15 with AMD’s RX 6800M averaged 94fps on this game. You could buy two Zephyrus G14s or two Strix G15s for the price of our M1 Max model and have a lot of money left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6dY8v"&gt;(The two M1 Pro machines did way worse here: they both averaged 46fps on the &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark, which is way closer to the 2019 Intel MacBook Pro than it is to the M1 Max.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdb8vQ"&gt;So: don’t buy these for gaming. They’re not gaming laptops; most games aren’t optimized for them. Buy something else if you want to play games. But if you want to get a lot of creative work done quickly, there’s nothing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new MagSafe 3 cable plugged in to the new MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xiSYPHj2vPjMlJSLj8_grXyEjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965873/akrales_211027_4820_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battery life on the new MacBook Pro 16 with the M1 Pro chip is as impressive as its raw performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="genDxM"&gt;All that performance is excellent, but here’s what’s really impressive: the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro ran for 16 hours on its battery during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KupG42"&gt;To test battery life, we just use the machines during the work day, without plugging in, and without letting the display go to sleep. So that 16 hours involved jumping between a dozen-ish Chrome tabs, using apps like Slack and Spotify, and often running Zoom calls and YouTube videos over that. At one point we were worried we’d fall asleep before the MacBook Pro did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lvFoVy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a noticeable difference in battery life between models with the M1 Pro and those with the M1 Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za9COQ"&gt;The other two MacBook Pro models didn’t last quite this long in similar testing — but their results are still exceptional. The 14-inch model with the M1 Pro lasted just over 10 and a half hours during normal use, and the 16-inch M1 Max model ran for just over 10 hours. A lot of you asked about battery life with an external display plugged in; when I worked for a day with the TV I use for Zoom intermittently plugged into the HDMI port on that M1 Max machine, battery life fell to seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SQi6R"&gt;These results make sense when you look at what’s inside these devices: the two 16-inch models both have a 100-watt-hour battery, which is the biggest laptop battery you’re allowed to bring on an airplane, while the 14-incher has a smaller 70-watt-hour battery. But the M1 Max has a whole bunch of extra GPU cores to power, and that drains the battery faster. I asked Apple, and the company confirmed the M1 Max uses more power both when idle and when active, but it noted that the M1 Max might potentially be more efficient if you run specific multi-core GPU workloads all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0yrvb"&gt;A lot of you asked whether the extra money for the M1 Max is worth it, and after all that, we think the answer is: no, not for most people. Carrying around all those extra GPUs has an impact on battery life whether you’re using them or not. Unless you can identify a specific part of your workflow that would benefit from serious multithreaded GPU acceleration, the reality is that you’re probably not going to use them. I recommend really thinking about whether the battery penalty of the M1 Max is worth it for what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of a space gray MacBook Pro 14 next to the back of a silver MacBook Pro 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwX_yBFt_XM0QGWyiIzPoHAS5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965898/akrales_211028_4820_0563.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get the MacBook Pro models in either dark gray or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gKO1yJ"&gt;So: those are the new MacBook Pros. They are some of the best laptops we have ever tested, with an unbeatable combination of lightning fast performance and tremendous battery life. And Apple seems to have come back to reality in terms of design — well, apart from that notch. But adding some useful ports and ditching the Touch Bar are just smart, practical choices, and honestly worth the upgrade for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="enovCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no denying how expensive these computers are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46bUyK"&gt;So what are the knocks? The biggest one is that these machines are expensive. If you’re an actual pro, the prices are perhaps easy to justify given the performance, but if you’re just doing everyday productivity work, you can get a lot of great laptops for less than the $2,000 starting price of the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And Apple only putting 16GB of RAM in the base models and charging $400 for an upgrade to 32GB is just ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnFzWT"&gt;The other is that Apple is still in the midst of the transition to its own chips, and the software ecosystem isn’t totally there. These machines feel like the future, but parts of that future are still a little bit hazy. Will Apple’s GPU ideas get fully supported by app developers? We’ve been asking that question for a while, and we still don’t know the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6UaXGa"&gt;But all that said: the new MacBook Pros are excellent. And we’ve all hopefully learned an important lesson about ports and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="K2IaY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834312"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft acquires Two Hat, a moderation company that helps keep Xbox clean</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MA2tE0AB4Ct_IR0CWHLUq1EUhQo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062209/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJXXt0"&gt;Microsoft has acquired Two Hat, a content moderation provider that’s helped keep harmful content off Xbox. Founded nearly 10 years ago by a former Disney Interactive security specialist, Two Hat uses AI to classify and filter billions of human interactions across messages, images, usernames, videos, and more. Microsoft has been working with Two Hat for the past few years to improve its Xbox communities, but the terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glT0Bn"&gt;“For the past few years, Microsoft and Two Hat have worked together to implement proactive moderation technology into gaming and non-gaming experiences to detect and remove harmful content before it ever reaches members of our communities,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/29/microsoft-acquires-two-hat-to-collaborate-on-online-safety-and-digital-wellness-solutions-for-online-communities/"&gt;explains Dave McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, head of Xbox product services. “Two Hat’s technology has helped to make global communities in Xbox, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and MSN safer for users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0n2o1L"&gt;The acquisition is designed to improve Microsoft’s first-party content moderation in gaming, and even extend to the company’s consumer services. Microsoft has big plans for consumer services, after hiring a former Uber exec to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628689/microsoft-manik-gupta-hire-uber-consumer-teams-skype-groupme"&gt;lead a new consumer apps effort earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG3LAf"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to acquire popular communities recently, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277845/microsoft-pinterest-acquisition-azure-cloud-services-rumors"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;. CEO Satya Nadella has expressed an interest in Microsoft focusing on creators and communities, and moderation plays a critical part in any online community-based service. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0heIEBuaQlo_viiocKkVn-2PcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19285103/1wKBN51.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox network has text filters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qPgwea"&gt;Two Hat also has a number of its own customers, and Microsoft isn’t planning to stop supporting them. “This is a deep investment in assisting and serving Two Hat’s existing customers, prospective new customers and multiple product and service experiences here at Microsoft,” says McCarthy. “With this acquisition, we will help global online communities to be safer and inclusive for everyone to participate, positively contribute and thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07C5Zw"&gt;Microsoft launched a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913323/microsoft-xbox-live-content-filters-messages-party-chat-moderation"&gt;text-based filters for its Xbox network&lt;/a&gt; three years ago, after Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18629892/microsoft-xbox-phil-spencer-video-games-industry-effort-toxicity-abuse-harassment"&gt;outlined a plan for fighting toxicity&lt;/a&gt; in gaming. Two Hat has been assisting with some of these Xbox moderation efforts, and Microsoft also has a much broader goal of being able to filter out Xbox Live party sessions in the future so live audio calls can be filtered with real-time bleeps similar to broadcast TV.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iPad Pro and Pencil are cheaper than ever today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqsAO2SovViJDbjhWjZoAabSUG8=/4x0:1852x1232/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062201/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.02.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can pick up the second-gen Apple Pencil today at Verizon for $100 instead of $130.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nVibj5"&gt;The latest 11-inch iPad Pro with an M1 processor is more affordable than ever before today at Amazon. The retail giant is currently selling the Wi-Fi version with 1TB &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931Z3CWQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,299&lt;/a&gt; (the space gray color sadly costs $1,429). As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we loved the 2021 iPad Pro’s blazing-fast M1 processor, its smaller form factor, and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks you in the frame while on video calls to keep you centered. It compensates for the fact that Apple still puts its selfie cam at the top of the tablet instead of along its side bezel. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbbu8i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833256"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VZYmYc"&gt;If you want a capable stylus that’s compatible with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, you can find the second-gen Apple Pencil for $100 instead of $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation%2F949679706" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals102821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, matching its record low price. Unlike the original model, the second-generation version features gesture controls and can wirelessly charge when magnetically attached to the side of your iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMWek1"&gt;Be aware, however, that the new Apple Pencil does not work with the newest entry-level iPad that costs $329. If you want one that is compatible with the iPad, consider picking up the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?sid=VergeDailyDeals10282021Second&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-for-ipad-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-generation stylus&lt;/a&gt;, which Verizon is currently selling for $80 instead of $100. Note that to charge the original model, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad’s Lightning connector — a design that remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;cringe-worthy&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1aUma8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gLVQui"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832871"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TIasGP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Apple Pencil 2 has gesture controls and charges wirelessly from the iPad Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"},{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WFPMDk"&gt;Our pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users are selling at an all-time low today on Amazon. Typically $400, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; for just $250, a 37 percent discount. As we wrote in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port for charging, and they fold up in a compact manner. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OsnZKa"&gt;We’ve got another great deal for non-Apple users, this time on a touchscreen laptop. In her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Monica Chin called the latest Surface Laptop 4 “a pretty damn good buy” in comparison to other 15-inch laptops, praising its performance, excellent battery life, and tall 3:2 aspect ratio display that lets you see more on-screen at once. What makes it an even better value is that you can currently purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YX1WLVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; for its lowest price to date. Typically $2,400, Amazon is selling the matte black-colored model with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of fast PCIe storage, and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7 processor for $2,250, a cool $150 off the list price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WRAjBo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgjekP"&gt;If you don’t have room in your home or your budget for a large-screened OLED, a couple of retailers are now selling the 48-inch version of LG’s C1 OLED at a record low. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 48-inch LG C1 for $1,097 and $1,100, respectively, down from $1,297. This model has all of the same perks as larger C1 models, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR support, and HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wO6emr"&gt;If you do want something bigger, the larger models are still discounted, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/28/22748849/apple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale"&gt;as we wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also offering a six-month subscription to HBO Max when you buy the 55-inch and 65-inch versions of the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is selling for $1,797&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,500, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is $1,297&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aERus"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7wtDQ"&gt;If you’re into gaming, Eneba is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fgamepilot%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year of PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; service for just $37 (the price can fluctuate just a bit) instead of its typical $60 retail price when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;365DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. The popular gaming subscription offers access to a range of perks, including exclusive discounts, access to online multiplayer, and complimentary games every month. PlayStation 5 users will get instant access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, which lets you play &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, and other blockbuster PlayStation 4 titles without paying an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqT0Dp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIuo0"&gt;If you’ve got an Xbox, you might be interested to hear that Eneba’s selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDailyDeals10282021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;for $28 (once again, the price can fluctuate) instead of its usual $45 when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;90DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Like the aforementioned PlayStation Plus deal, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as many EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on PC, Android, and iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the biggest perk of Game Pass Ultimate is that it lets you access more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;finally launches on December 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot looks like a scary Jim Henson puppet in this Rolling Stones tribute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VglW7XxG8YxsHy522BQRKAmzToQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062176/maxresdefault.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LcoMto"&gt;Old snake hips, Mick Jagger, has met his robotic match. Boston Dynamics has released a tribute to The Rolling Stones’ iconic music video for their 1981 hit “Start Me Up,” with band members replaced by the company’s quadrupedal Spot robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP3tSA"&gt;It is, as with most things Boston Dynamics, either: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tJQcMS"&gt;cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lrPC2P"&gt;creepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZXBqr6"&gt;a harbinger of a terrible future in which people are hunted in the streets by robot dogs armed with knives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ryZrE9"&gt;a harbinger of a wonderful future in which people, I don’t know, go to a dance party with robot dogs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="YAaMXR"&gt;Just take your pick and &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don’t mention that &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; episode. You know the one I mean. At this point, everybody has made the same comparison and nobody cares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mk3kl"&gt;More prosaically, this video is both a demonstration of Spot’s impressive mobility and of Boston Dynamics’ ongoing desire to make its robots seem fun. The company has a bit of a PR problem, in that its wares are so closely associated with robot quadrupeds, that when some totally unrelated company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726111/robot-dogs-with-guns-sword-international-ghost-robotics"&gt;straps a gun onto a totally unrelated four-legged robot&lt;/a&gt;, people on social media still shout that “those sickos at Boston Dynamics have got to go!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcED6K"&gt;Boston Dynamics itself, though, seems more interesting in selling its robots to business customers as tools to survey and surveil factories, power plants, mines, and the like. Really, just check out the last three videos the company uploaded before this Rolling Servos effort: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/od-1l_l6q5d2smoMiwJWWLCIjLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966410/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_2.06.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CpUNx7"&gt;Of course, this is not to say that Boston Dynamics is an uninvolved bystander when it comes to the military / law enforcement deployment of robots, which many think adds new dangers to these professions. It’s happy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;supplying cops&lt;/a&gt; with Spot robots, for example, and has even trialed them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;with the French army&lt;/a&gt;. But it does at least have a strict “no weapons on the robots” policy, which many of its peers do not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U6Uka"&gt;At any rate, in 30 years’ time when you get tazed by a robot dog for not mining steel fast enough to build Bezos’ third space mansion, remember that that machine may once have had dreams of being a dancer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SteelSeries’ latest headsets have better battery life and USB-C charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Arctis 7P Plus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QVmBOwQ_RWDqfhM_zZDXlWT10Ao=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061939/steelseriesarctis7pplus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Arctis 7P Plus is available in white or black.&lt;/em&gt; | SteelSeries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDzQtq"&gt;SteelSeries’ new Arctis 7 Plus and 7P Plus wireless headsets have two key improvements over their predecessors: better battery life, going up to 30 hours per charge from 24 hours with three hours of use from a 15-minute fast charge, and USB-C charging. Most other major headset makers have used that connector for years now, but SteelSeries has been oddly slow to adopt it, even though it has shipped its clever USB-C audio transmitter with select headsets since 2019. With previous SteelSeries wireless headsets, you always needed to make sure that an archaic Micro USB cable was never too far away. But not anymore with these new headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65IghR"&gt;SteelSeries also touts that both headsets are compatible with the Oculus Quest 2, adding another platform to the long list of devices they can work on wirelessly. That list includes the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, macOS computers, Windows computers, any USB-C-equipped iPads, and Android. For computers or consoles lacking a USB-C port, you can use the included USB-C-to-A cable. The headset is compatible over a wired connection to anything that has a 3.5mm jack, though you’ll need to use the included cable that plugs into the headset’s proprietary port. The 3.5mm port on the headset is strictly for audio sharing, letting you daisy chain one headset to another.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Arctis 7P Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Ej5MaQ_InwMTsRckrh7B0DWU_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962870/steelseriesarctis7pplus_usbc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C charging is a long-awaited addition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8DWyZO"&gt;While each headset is essentially the same overall design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21502286/steelseries-arctis-7p-7x-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-usbc-wireless-gaming-headset"&gt;as before&lt;/a&gt;, SteelSeries is charging a $20 premium for the improvements here. The Arctis 7 Plus and Arctis 7P Plus will each cost $169.99 when they launch today, October 29th. And just so you know, each headset offers the same platform compatibility and mostly the same set of features. The key difference is that the dial along the right edge of the 7P Plus controls the mic sidetone, whereas on the Arctis 7 Plus it adjusts the game and chat audio mix. The Arctis 7 Plus is available in black, while the 7P Plus is available in black or white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkHDYZ"&gt;These improvements make the Arctis 7 Plus and 7P Plus considerably more competitive with other headsets in this price range. The new features aside, these are worth considering for the ski goggle suspension headband that keeps the frame of the headset from resting its weight on top of your head, as well as the retractable microphone with a dedicated mic sidetone dial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynz4zs"&gt;These are the headsets that I’ve waited a long time for SteelSeries to make, so I’m excited to test them out to see if they make the cut as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;best gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft PowerToys get Windows 11 UI updates, universal mic mute, and find my mouse feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWTGVBQcFWAeUhc-gegv94_mgQ4=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061421/powertoys_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9MdAr"&gt;Microsoft is updating its PowerToys for Windows with new UI changes for Windows 11, a universal video conference mute, and a find my mouse feature. The software maker has been gradually improving PowerToys ahead of the Windows 11 launch, with a settings interface to match the OS and now changes to its PowerRename feature that better match the Windows 11 design improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGnoOe"&gt;PowerRename, a feature to make it easier to rename files, no longer looks like it has a dialog box from the Windows 7 era. Microsoft has updated PowerRename with a far more modern interface, and easier to find options for renaming files in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UluK6g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Old vs. new UI for PowerToys Rename! Go get it now in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerToys?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PowerToys&lt;/a&gt; 0.49.. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x7xLB6YZyg"&gt;https://t.co/x7xLB6YZyg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YjIL2vavfZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YjIL2vavfZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Niels Laute (@Niels9001) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Niels9001/status/1453807954206105614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBVVGw"&gt;Alongside the design tweaks, PowerToys is also getting two new features with this &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/latest"&gt;0.49 version update&lt;/a&gt;. Video Conference Mute debuts with this release, a feature that lets you mute your microphone or disable your webcam globally across Windows 10 or Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UcoDG"&gt;You can bind Video Conference Mute to a keyboard shortcut, and pick the webcam and microphone you’d like to disable. There’s even a toolbar that appears when a webcam or microphone is in use. Microsoft had been planning to launch Windows 11 with its own universal microphone mute button, but this feature didn’t make the release and should be coming at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vxQBovhw6VnlM3sG_y8OXD_rI0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966179/g8Da16A.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerToys Video Conference Mute feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzNIrXNoWQRC79JFJi6Ie_5ogNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966184/j0wadII.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My Mouse will dim your screen to reveal the cursor location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1suM"&gt;The second new feature is Find My Mouse, which as the name implies will help you find your mouse cursor. Windows has had built-in support for finding a cursor for years, but this is a far better implementation. You simply tap CTRL twice and your screen will dim to highlight where your cursor is with a spotlight. While you probably won’t need this on a laptop, it will be useful if you’re working with large high-resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFqMkp"&gt;Both of the new PowerToys features are available in the latest 0.49 update from &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/latest"&gt;Microsoft’s PowerToys GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. PowerToys also includes a number of other utilities, including a feature to keep your PC awake, FancyZones to improve layouts and multitasking, and a PowerToys Run launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp8PN9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
