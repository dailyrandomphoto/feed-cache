    <title>OpenSea has an app, but you can’t buy NFTs on it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iC7t2TBgRok7frJkRFb75byos-I=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884718/new_ios_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenSea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4A8Dxz"&gt;OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT marketplaces, has &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-opensea-mobile-app/"&gt;launched its first app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android. The app allows OpenSea users to view the platform’s collection of digital items, but notably doesn’t allow for any kind of money to change hands, digital or otherwise (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/opensea-released-an-app-but-its-for-browsing-not-buying-and-selling/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybGWiw"&gt;The OpenSea app basically works as a kind of gallery. You can browse artwork, share listings you find, and lovingly ogle and manage your own NFTs. The app shares a lot of the same blue and white stylings of the OpenSea site, just missing the button that says “Buy Now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2MuHcc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKt59kExL-o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="470Qz0"&gt;There are a couple possible reasons why actual NFT purchases are missing. At the most obvious, highest level, OpenSea probably doesn’t want to share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; of NFT transactions with the likes of Apple and Google. That doesn’t help the people selling the work, and it doesn’t help OpenSea. The other complicating factor is that OpenSea’s payments are frequently in Ethereum, which currently isn’t supported as an in-app payment method on either platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruErxz"&gt;On paper, the OpenSea app furthers the company’s goal of “making NFTs more available to all,” but without the key economic element — the one being sold to struggling artists and speculated upon by hungry investors — it’ll first and foremost be another way to look at nice JPEGs. The app is also launching at an awkward time for the company. OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677793/opensea-product-chief-resign-nft-insider-trading-accusations"&gt;a high-profile exit from the company&lt;/a&gt; last week following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;accusations of insider NFT trading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface hardware event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E08s42Hw9b1y-XqXLab63Oq2YRY=/100x0:1179x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884608/microsoft_surface_event_invite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A variety of new hardware updates are expected from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="epbR7Z"&gt;September 22nd officially marks the first day of fall, and with it gadget season. Like in previous years, Microsoft is getting into the mix with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;forthcoming Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, where we anticipate the company will announce a slew of products during its livestream presentation on Wednesday at 11AM ET / 8AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1u7z3"&gt;Microsoft has been building up plenty of momentum recently with the impending launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600261/windows-11-beta-release-insider-microsoft-download-test"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. And with the new operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;set to launch on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only natural to showcase it with new devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdDxfF"&gt;The reports and leaks seem to indicate that we may see updates to Microsoft’s Surface Pro, Surface Book, Surface Go, and Surface Duo lines. Many details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 have already leaked&lt;/a&gt;, including its new Intel 11th Gen processor, 120Hz display, and switch to Thunderbolt ports. While less early info has surfaced on the Book and Go refreshes, the former is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;slotted to have a significant design overhaul&lt;/a&gt; while the latter will most likely see its changes happen on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vvsf0"&gt;Beyond Windows 11 devices, Microsoft is expected to announce a successor to the dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaks for the Duo 2 began earlier in the summer&lt;/a&gt;, promising an internal spec bump and a new triple-camera setup in addition to some smaller design tweaks. The big questions around the Duo 2 are in software and support, as the original Duo’s stagnation — it’s still stuck on Android 10 when Android 12 is around the corner — and slow sales have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;landed it in the clearance sections of many retailers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoWh9B"&gt;Regardless of whether Microsoft actually proves its Android chops with the Duo 2 or launches any surprises with its new flagships for Windows 11, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products are announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Hanks embraces two of man’s best friends in the trailer for Finch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHMJOEAP4qvty3equDX9ELM86Jk=/0x0:6044x4029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884533/081221_Apple_Films_Tom_Hanks_Finch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqkttC"&gt;Tom Hanks is set to return to Apple TV Plus in &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt;, a soon-to-debut feature film about a robotics engineer surviving a new post-apocalyptic world with his four-legged companion Goodyear (and a robot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPM5hf"&gt;The heart of &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt;’s storyline centers on Hanks’ determination to find a caretaker for Goodyear after his death. The science-fiction drama takes place after a solar flare that devastated life on earth. Finch, the engineer, has been surviving a post-apocalyptic wasteland for a decade in an underground bunker, where he lives with his dog Goodyear — a very good boy and Finch’s only companion after the catastrophic event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6kFAl"&gt;In this underground workspace, Finch develops a robot, Jeff, with whom they’ll embark on a treacherous journey to beat a deadly storm to safety. Along the way, they’ll have to navigate extreme weather phenomena, merciless heat, UV radiation, and other unexpected challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wRXAVx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0bYWnP3jH4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lMBUXX"&gt;The film arrives as Apple looks to ramp up its original film slate. Martin Scorsese’s &lt;em&gt;Killers of the Flower Moon&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning drama &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;, Mahershala Ali-starring &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt;, and A24 joints &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sharper&lt;/em&gt; are just a handful of titles soon set to debut on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liepBx"&gt;Apple has been laser-focused focused on developing award-winning titles over churning out content on a budget, and &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; is the second Tom Hanks-starring feature film to debut on the service after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;acquired &lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt; from Sony&lt;/a&gt; last year. But to date, Apple’s original films haven’t had quite the cultural impact enjoyed by its critical darling &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673907/apple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars"&gt;record-breaking number&lt;/a&gt; of Emmy nominations this year for a first-season comedy and ultimately, including its Creative Arts Emmy Awards wins, claimed seven awards. Of its 35 total Emmy nominations this year, Apple on Sunday won &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F09%2Fapples-global-hit-comedy-series-ted-lasso-sweeps-the-2021-primetime-emmy-awards-scoring-history-making-win-for-outstanding-comedy-series%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22684504%2Fapple-tv-plus-finch-trailer-dog-robot-tom-hanks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11 total Emmys&lt;/a&gt; across five titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj1T2Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt; was nominated for a bevy of awards, including an academy award for best sound. But &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will have much broader appeal than a World War II drama. Apple has proven it can win on warm-and-fuzzy mass appeal. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will finally help Apple TV Plus secure the feature film award wins it’s been gunning for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqa5eQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will premiere ​​Friday, November 5th on Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate Democrats call on FTC to fix data privacy ‘crisis’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1bnhrYq18fBDKa_uAVUzsW4eXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884484/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C5Xa7b"&gt;Senate Democrats are calling on the Federal Trade Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.09.20%20-%20FTC%20-%20Privacy%20Rulemaking.pdf"&gt;write new rules&lt;/a&gt; to protect consumer data privacy in a new letter to the agency authored on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OcVkq"&gt;The letter, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and signed by eight other Democratic senators, was sent to FTC Chair Lina Khan Monday, calling on the agency to “begin a rulemaking process” on privacy. Specifically, the senators are requesting that the FTC pen new rules addressing privacy, civil rights, and the collection of consumer data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTyc5J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumer privacy has become a consumer crisis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wcOGhr"&gt;“Consumer privacy has become a consumer crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Tech companies have routinely broken their promises to consumers and neglected their legal obligations, only to receive wrist-slap punishments after long delay, providing little relief to consumers, and with minimal deterrent effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5B5r9"&gt;The FTC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Na5"&gt;The letter comes just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;President Joe Biden nominated&lt;/a&gt; longtime privacy and facial recognition critic Alvaro Bedoya to become the third Democratic FTC commissioner. At Georgetown Law, Bedoya led research into the effects of technologies like facial recognition on minority groups and produced several surveys studying the tech’s potential for racial bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqdQgu"&gt;Bedoya is a professor at Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology, and has previously served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law under Chairman Sen. Al Franken (D-MN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf5Apu"&gt;The Senate has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing for Bedoya, but he would likely help the FTC craft any future rulemakings related to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA67xe"&gt;Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444515/amy-klobuchar-data-privacy-protection-facebook-state-laws"&gt;tried and failed&lt;/a&gt; to craft its own data privacy legislation over the last few years, and an FTC rulemaking could be the government’s best chance at regulating the industry in light of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21153117/congress-tech-regulation-privacy-bill-coppa-ads-laws-legislators"&gt;tense partisan divides&lt;/a&gt;. In July, the FTC voted to update the agency’s rulemaking procedures in a way that would make it easier to issue comprehensive privacy rules on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiVa7k"&gt;“Consumers deserve strong and enforceable privacy safeguards in the digital economy — opening a rulemaking would be a powerful step toward addressing this long overdue need,” the lawmakers wrote in their Monday letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1IlLk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6ikNA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase cancels Lend program launch after SEC fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVOcvV_72rUFgTSZubJCcLhCCKw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884297/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uDZPwX"&gt;Crypto exchange Coinbase has discontinued its plans to launch a Lend feature designed to let customers earn interest on certain coins &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/coinbase-global-drops-plan-to-launch-crypto-lending-program"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The company announced the change by &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb"&gt;updating a blog post from late June&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would also be discontinuing the waitlist that it had set up for the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI6SYT"&gt;The cancellation comes after Coinbase received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;legal warnings about the feature&lt;/a&gt; from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;Coinbase said&lt;/a&gt; that it would be delaying the now-canceled feature “until at least October.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFPh1Q"&gt;Coinbase promised that the Lend feature would offer users a 4 percent APY return if they let the company make loans to “verified borrowers” with it. The company planned to the stablecoin USDC to power the feature, but &lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/"&gt;its price hasn’t been significantly affected&lt;/a&gt; by this news as its value is tied to the US dollar. The webpage with information about the program, as well as a signup page for the waitlist, now redirects to Coinbase’s homepage (but it can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210909081423/https://www.coinbase.com/lend"&gt;viewed on the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eea5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Coinbase said it’s still looking for “regulatory clarity for the crypto industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGU5Ob"&gt;According to Coinbase, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;threatened the company with a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; if it launched the Lend feature. The regulatory body argued that Lend would deal with securities, and would therefore be regulated as an investment product. Earlier in September, Coinbase’s CEO posted a thread on Twitter, saying that the SEC hadn’t been clear with it about why the feature would be considered a security, or what Coinbase could do to fix it. Still, the Lend feature does seem similar to an interest-bearing bond, which would typically be regulated as securities as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1435606347807006728"&gt;an apparent subtweet&lt;/a&gt; from the SEC pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRyf1u"&gt;Coinbase said in its cancellation update it’s still looking for “regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHS8M"&gt;According to Coinbase, the &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;SEC asked for the names and contact info&lt;/a&gt; of everyone on the aforementioned waitlist as part of its investigation. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what will happen to the data of those who signed up to the waitlist now that it’s been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qG0w2o"&gt;General Motors said Monday that it will start swapping new batteries into Chevy Bolt EVs in October in response to at least a dozen fires that triggered a massive recall. GM did not say when it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;restart production of brand new versions&lt;/a&gt; of the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLWBIq"&gt;The news comes as LG is once again making batteries for the Bolt after stopping in August. GM says it worked closely with the South Korean conglomerate to make sure the new cells are free of defects that have led to at lest a dozen fires in the automaker’s electric vehicle and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;a massive recall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNs8"&gt;Owners of older Bolts (model years 2017 to 2019) will have all the modules in their battery packs swapped for new ones. Owners of newer models may only get individual modules changed out, GM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="diiOua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery swaps will start in October&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cw98E0"&gt;GM said Monday that it will also have dealers start installing new diagnostic software on Bolts in the next 60 days. The software will continually scan the battery packs for signs of defects. If none are found, the software will eventually allow owners to once again charge their vehicles to 100 percent, and abandon some of the other safety guidelines GM has put in place while it worked out the recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3805Z0"&gt;The initial fix for the recall, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, involved an earlier version of this diagnostic software, though at least two vehicles that received it still caught fire. GM did not go into much detail Monday about how this new software differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imzpIW"&gt;In the meantime, Bolt owners are supposed to continue adhering to that guidance. GM says owners should park outside and away from their homes after charging, and that they should not charge their vehicles indoors overnight. Owners should not charge their Bolts beyond 90 percent, and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of remaining range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdsESZ"&gt;GM made one minor tweak to its guidance, though. As long as they follow the above guidelines, GM says owners need only leave “ample space” between their Bolt and other vehicles, instead 50 feet as it recently advised. It did not define “ample,” though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UVfd7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Owners should leave “ample space” when parking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szFokd"&gt;GM first issued a recall for the the earlier models of the Bolt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of fires. But it wasn’t until July of this year that it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;what the problem was&lt;/a&gt;. In rare cases, some cells that LG made had two different defects — a torn anode and a folded separator — that, when combined, made it possible for a Bolt’s battery pack to catch fire while charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIQtsW"&gt;LG shut down production of the cells in August, around when GM decided to recall all model years of the Bolt. GM said Monday that production resumed at two locations it runs with LG in Michigan, but that factories in South Korea were still not back online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwQGAo"&gt;The recall has already cost GM some $2 billion. The automaker has said it intends to recoup some or most of that amount from LG — though the two companies are working together on GM’s next-generation Ultium batteries, and will operate multiple new battery factories in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes is on trial for fraud over her time at Theranos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Global Forum - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jd7qe4CVeHAD45_aBIbsj-fSPVI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884166/495430212.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood testing company Theranos, is being tried for 12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The trial is expected to last through December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZleF9Y"&gt;Theranos was valued as high as $9 billion, and Holmes was a darling of Silicon Valley, sporting black turtlenecks that prompted comparisons to Steve Jobs. That is, until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;John Carreyrou’s exposé&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;In that article, Carreyrou wrote that Theranos was using its own device for only a handful of tests and that other employees were concerned that the device wasn’t accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1l27X"&gt;Then it came out that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-found-at-theranos-lab-1453684743"&gt;Theranos’ labs weren’t up to par&lt;/a&gt; and its partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11919874/walgreens-ends-theranos-blood-testing-partnership"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; fell apart. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;Theranos junked two years’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of test results. Eventually, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the question is whether Holmes deliberately misled patients and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s big fall hardware event is set for September 28th </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SIKuA"&gt;Amazon has officially announced the date for its big fall hardware event: it’ll take place on Tuesday, September 28th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. As always, Amazon isn’t giving any details on what to expect — the invite sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; only says that they’ll be “news about our latest Amazon devices, features, and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5zrSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21450413/amazon-echo-alexa-ring-luna-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;In previous years&lt;/a&gt;, though, Amazon has announced new Echo speakers, updates to Alexa’s software, new Eero routers, updated Ring cameras, and more. Amazon also tends to announce its more unique and experimental products at its fall event: previous years have send the announcement of the Echo Loop ring, the Echo Frames glasses, and the Ring drone (which has yet to make a re-appearance since its initial debut last year.) We may have gotten an early look at Ring’s dash cam as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540298/amazon-ring-car-dash-cam-image-support-article"&gt;when images leaked out this June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orIxel"&gt;The event is invite only, so don’t expect a public livestream, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news as soon as it happens on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP Elite Dragonfly Max review: pretty fly for a steep buy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This laptop is flying business class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OoSpXF"&gt;HP’s Elite Dragonfly Max is the nicest business laptop I’ve ever used. That doesn’t mean it’s the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;, all things considered — when it comes to performance, battery life, and features, the Dragonfly has fierce competition from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22613661/dell-latitude-9420-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Latitudes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt; of the world. But there’s no business laptop out there that matches the elegance of a Dragonfly. It’s a sleek, light, and beautiful computer — and that beauty is a big part of its hefty, hefty price tag.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3D16D"&gt;Right, the price tag. Before we get into this: The cheapest Dragonfly Max has an MSRP of $3,347 (currently listed at a still-expensive $2,409.84). You can buy my test model for, oh, a discounted price of just $2,622.24. That puts the Dragonfly Max out of reach for most people. And frankly, given the device’s small but noteworthy list of drawbacks, I do think it’s too high. But it’s a gorgeous laptop, it’s really fun to use, and it’s a great case study in the very peak of what a laptop can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Utbn2J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10754422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0qzdsn"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Felitebook--zbook---probook%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Elite Dragonfly models&lt;/a&gt; you can currently buy: the Dragonfly Max, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-g2-notebook-pc-p-38s12ut-aba-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dragonfly G2&lt;/a&gt;. Both have been upgraded to 11th-Gen Intel processors and DDR4 memory — HP tells me they’re aimed at “mobile users who loved Dragonfly, but want an even faster and smarter device”. There are some new smart features including AI noise reduction for video calls, and new security features like a tamper lock. The Dragonfly Max adds an upgraded 5MP camera, an extra microphone, a blue light shield, a new black color, and a few extra security features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qRMsX"&gt;The other noteworthy difference is that the Dragonfly G2 has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619889818%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of different configurations&lt;/a&gt;: You can choose between five processors, three displays, two batteries, and various types of storage, as well as a number of add-ons, and prices are all across the board. You can make a few adjustments to the Dragonfly Max, but its options are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619930818%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;much more limited&lt;/a&gt; — two processors, one screen, one battery. It’s targeting a very specific deep-pocketed business user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max keyboard seen from above on a fabric bench.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a seriously impressive keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB 3.1, power button, nano lock slot, and nano SIM slot on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm audio / microphone jack, two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sSmOpv"&gt;One thing to note: all Dragonfly Max models come with Sure View Reflect, one of the Dragonfly line’s biggest calling cards. SureView reflect is a privacy screen that makes it very difficult for potential snoops to see what you’re doing. It’s optional on the G2, and costs an extra $145 over the standard display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PfuVo"&gt;If you’re not buying the Dragonfly for its suave design, you’re buying it for Sure View Reflect. I’ve tested a few different privacy screens, and Sure View Reflect is hands-down the best one. If I moved my head a bit to the side, or angled the display slightly up or down such that I wasn’t facing it head on, I basically couldn’t make out any of its contents. Someone sitting next to me on a train or even peering over my shoulder would’ve had trouble gleaning any info. It’s an impressive feature, and doesn’t visibly impact screen brightness or glare much at all. (Of course, if you’re in a situation where you’ll be collaborating or moving your head around a lot, you can always turn the feature off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7VCA2"&gt;Sure View aside, the Dragonfly Max’s touch display is quite accurate and vivid, and delivers a whopping 1,000 nits of brightness — a number that’s unusual for anything that’s not a devastatingly expensive business laptop to reach. (Enabling Sure View will dim the display, of course.) It’s compatible with HP’s Wacom AES 2.0 pen, which is (frustratingly) not shipped with the device, as it did with previous Dragonfly generations. It costs an extra $74. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJl1e3"&gt;I do have a couple other complaints. For one, the screen is 16:9, which is falling out of fashion on expensive laptops for a reason. Lenovo has adopted the roomier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623290/thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs"&gt;16:10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22642876/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs"&gt;3:2&lt;/a&gt; aspect ratios on a number of its premium ThinkPads, and HP should do the same with the Dragonfly. Both offer more vertical space and a more comfortable multitasking experience. Additionally, the screen picks up fingerprints and smudges very easily, and they weren’t trivial to wipe off. These aren’t as visible as they would be on a dimmer screen, but they did cheapen my viewing experience a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ak7GWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My picture was a bit washed out with the light from my window&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzb5Yh"&gt;The other reason you might want the Max over the G2 is its upgraded camera. The Dragonfly Max has a 5MP webcam with a separate infrared sensor. Webcams are often a weak point of otherwise-stellar laptops, and this webcam certainly improves upon the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It does a better job in low light than I’m used to seeing from webcams, and colors were fairly accurate. Coworkers on a Zoom call remarked that they could make out surprisingly minute details of my feed: strands of hair, my nose stud, etc. Of course, that doesn’t mean it delivers a &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;picture — my picture was a bit washed out with the light from my window, and there was still noticeable noise. It’s a good experience, but not something I’d buy the Dragonfly Max just to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI5wvK"&gt;The webcam also has a physical shutter that’s easy to click back and forth (though it’s tiny and black, so finding it takes a bit of guesswork). The separate IR sensor means Windows Hello facial recognition works even when the shutter is closed. You can also sign in with the fingerprint reader located below the right arrow key, which didn’t give me any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOe0sw"&gt;Paired with the webcam are four microphones (two front-facing and two back-facing) with AI noise cancelation. These picked up my voice just fine in video conferences, and can be killed easily with the F8 key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max closed seen from above on a fabric bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzP7mwEGg-Lm2njP4cxpG0GC4Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864076/akrales_210917_4733_0055.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noise cancelation is driven by a “deep neural network”, HP says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="h1de3h"&gt;HP continues including sustainable material in its high-end laptops, though its current pronouncements are slightly more conservative than they have been in past years. As was the case on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;, the keyboard is made from 50 percent PCR DVDs, and 80 percent of mechanical parts are recycled material. The Max’s bezels are 45 precent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics — the early-2020 Dragonfly’s bezels were 35 percent PCR plastic. But some of the Max’s other pronouncements are a bit of a step down from the previous Dragonfly. The speaker enclosures are 45 percent PCR plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics, while the previous Dragonfly’s speaker box was 50 percent PCR plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics. And 90 percent of the Dragonfly Max’s cover is recycled magnesium, while the previous Dragonfly’s entire chassis was 90 percent recycled. Still, it’s nice to see HP pursuing sustainability with its high-end lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXzQ5Q"&gt;The good news for shoppers, though, is that the recycled materials do nothing to cheapen the chassis. The Dragonfly Max has a smooth and comfortable texture, and feels quite sturdy. It has a striking, premium look rivaled only by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s own Spectre line&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. A hallmark of cheap plastic is that it accumulates fingerprints very quickly, but the Dragonfly remained smudge-free after over a week of testing. (The lid picked up a few, but they were only visible under bright light and were easily wiped away.) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pH5yRvP4UEWosUF42xzu7GGg2mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864074/akrales_210917_4733_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shutter is satisfying to click back and forth absentmindedly if you’re fidgety like me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KaeAyy"&gt;Open the device up, and you’ll find a dizzying list of security features targeting C-suites and IT departments. New to these Dragonfly models is a tamper lock, which is meant to detect when a potential hacker has popped the chassis open to fiddle with components — if this occurs, the PC will require a BIOS password to be entered before it boots again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXwYQe"&gt;Within the OS is Sure Click, a secure browser that opens websites within a CPU-isolated virtual machine. That means any malware you pick up while using Sure Click will be isolated from the rest of your system, and will disappear when you close the browser. It also offers protected viewing for PDFs and Office documents. I dinked around with it, and it was very easy to use, and conveniently ported over all my bookmarks. It has a slightly different color scheme from regular Chrome, so I never mixed up my tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adbG6z"&gt;The device comes preloaded with a laundry list of other software. There’s Sure Sense, which scans every file you download for malware, and can detect “zero day never-before-seen threats”, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fh20195.www2.hp.com%2Fv2%2FGetDocument.aspx%3Fdocname%3D4AA7-7264ENW&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;per HP&lt;/a&gt;. There’s Sure Run, which keeps crucial processes running if malware tries to shut them down. There’s Easy Clean, which can temporarily disable the Dragonfly’s keyboard, touchscreen, and touchpad so you (or someone else) can wipe it down without accidentally booting it up. And there’s a Tile tracker inside, which you can use to locate the Dragonfly Max if you lose it via Tile’s massive crowd-finding network. It’s easy to set up and use, especially if you already have a Tile account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP Elite Dragonfly Max seen from the front, open, on a fabric bench. The screen displays an orange, blue, and purple gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVMXPVRNlFoOatZ1EWvgXZOii0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864071/akrales_210917_4733_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The finish is “Sparkling Black”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="wsGiw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10754438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="S93JAs"&gt;Those are just the standout features of the Dragonfly Max — everything else about it is also hard to beat. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and optional 5G. It’s quite light, at just 2.49 pounds and 0.63 inches thick. The audio (via two upward-firing and two downward-firing speakers) is excellent, with bass and percussion that are audible, if not strong. The keyboard is a delight, with just the right amount of click and travel. There’s a surprisingly robust port selection for such a thin machine, including two Thunderbolt 4, one combo audio jack, one HDMI 2.0, one USB 3.1, one nano lock slot, and one nano SIM slot. And the chassis never got uncomfortably hot, nor were the fans ever loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUBEFt"&gt;The processor — a Core i7-1185G7 with support for Intel’s vPro, did a good job with all kinds of tasks, including heaps upon heaps of tabs and videos. I only saw a minor slowdown once, when I was using the Battery Saver profile and trying to jump between Slack and Chrome while running a Zoom call in the background. Switching off Battery Saver nipped that in the bud. Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics can lend a hand in GPU-intensive tasks or games like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, though you wouldn’t want to use the Dragonfly as a primary gaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38G9Ac"&gt;Battery life, though, was my biggest disappointment. I took the Dragonfly Max through my normal workday, juggling around a dozen Chrome tabs with some Spotify or YouTube streaming and Zoom calls on medium brightness with Battery Saver on, and it lasted an average of seven and a half hours. That result was remarkably consistent within 20 or so minutes, regardless of battery profile or what I did with Sure View. That’s not a devastating result, and it means the Dragonfly Max can make it through close to a full day if your workload is similar to mine. But it’s disappointing considering the competition — I got over 11 and a half hours out of the previous Dragonfly, and the Dell Latitude 9420 broke 10 while on the Battery Saver profile. And, of course, all kinds of more affordable consumer laptops can last much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP logo on the HP Elite Dragonfly Max bottom bezel." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrU85Fu-nsLhA7tcz9bEXNwKnec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864075/akrales_210917_4733_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gorgeous, high-priced commitment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="EyZDFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10754444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8RV5Z9"&gt;The Dragonfly is a great machine to buy, if you can afford it. I especially don’t begrudge IT departments for taking a look — businesses often buy these things in bulk and aren’t paying full price. Almost every aspect is good, and there are features you really can’t get anywhere else. If you’re looking for a combination of an embedded Tile tracker, an effective privacy screen, a 2.49-pound chassis, and a 5MP webcam with a separate infrared sensor, the Dragonfly Max is basically your only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHTJgH"&gt;But given how much money HP is asking for this thing, I can’t help but look at even mild drawbacks with a fairly critical eye. I don’t need a laptop to be completely flawless in order to recommend that you spend over $2,400 on it (or upwards of $3,000, depending on the day) — I’m willing to forgive a squeaky keyboard or an oddly-placed port here and there. But I do need it to have all-day battery life. I need its screen not to be covered in smudges. In this year 2021, I need it not to be 16:9. And, yes, I probably do need it to ship with a stylus. For that reason, I think most consumers are probably better suited to the regular G2, which starts &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-g2-notebook-pc-p-38s12ut-aba-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,819&lt;/a&gt; and is much more customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Og3K3q"&gt;The Max is a luxury product, at the end of the day. It’s not so much a pragmatic purchase (for most of us) as it is a proof of concept — what could a laptop be if money were no object? The answer, as it turns out, is: very nice, and very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next pro iPhone might finally ditch the notch</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9vJ2u"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679747/apple-iphone-13-pro-mini-max-video-feature-tour"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; isn’t even here yet, but speculation about Apple’s future phones never slows down. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;some rumors about Apple’s event last week didn’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;, certain leaks were right on, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;information about a smaller notch and high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUyx8"&gt;Now Kuo reports (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-to-feature-hole-punch-design-new-48mp-wide-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that plans for next year’s iPhones point to high-end Pro and Pro Max models that ditch the notch entirely in favor of hole-punch front cameras, with 48MP wide cameras on the back. However, Kuo expects that in-screen fingerprint scanning for Touch ID is off until 2023, despite his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;earlier reporting&lt;/a&gt; that it could happen as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iVwJIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"},{"title":"iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jZWAMA"&gt;A possible foldable iPhone is even further off, slipping from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;previous projection of 2023&lt;/a&gt; to 2024 at the earliest. More immediately, Kuo reiterates expectations of a 5G-equipped iPhone SE next spring and a larger non-Pro version of the iPhone 14 that offers the 6.7-inch frame without the extra Pro features and price bump.&lt;/p&gt;
