    <title>Controversial crypto rules remain in infrastructure bill after House vote</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0fJ9o"&gt;Controversial new cryptocurrency tax requirements are likely to become law through the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The cryptocurrency community rallied to fix the language, but the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/amid-turmoil-democrats-delay-house-vote-infrastructure-budget-bills-n1277516"&gt;House voted to proceed&lt;/a&gt; with the bill as is on Tuesday, moving forward without any new amendments or opportunities to change it.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETvE60"&gt;On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and a group of moderate Democrats reached a deal to approve a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, schedule floor action on the bipartisan infrastructure deal by September 27th, and advance voting rights legislation. The agreement comes after a group of moderate Democrats pledged to vote down the multitrillion-dollar social safety net package if it was approved before the bipartisan infrastructure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ONRR0Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re disappointed but not surprised”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOV2cG"&gt;However, the deal also prohibits any new amendments from being considered to the infrastructure package unless the House approves a new rule that would allow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cBcGK"&gt;The deal strikes a devastating blow to the cryptocurrency community that spent the last few weeks working to remove language from the infrastructure package that could extend burdensome tax reporting requirements to wallet developers and miners. Several amendments were proposed in the Senate earlier this month, but they ultimately failed, leaving the problematic language in the final bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEt0Bo"&gt;“We’re disappointed but not surprised,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center communications director, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It was always a long shot. That said, we have opportunities over the coming months to get this fixed in legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNxWVr"&gt;Several House lawmakers, like Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA), opposed the bill’s broad definition of “broker” and the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus sent a letter to members of Congress calling for a fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY5Roh"&gt;Still, cryptocurrency advocates may have a chance to influence how the rules are applied. The Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/house-moves-to-consider-unamended-infrastructure-bill"&gt;has reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that it would issue new guidance on the rules once they’re passed, ensuring that it would provide exemptions to firms that do not operate as brokers. But it’s unclear if Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would support more industry-friendly rules. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/yellen-sounds-warning-about-extremely-inefficient-bitcoin.html"&gt;In an interview with CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year, Yellen called Bitcoin an “extremely inefficient” asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXuocG"&gt;She continued, “It is a highly speculative asset and you know I think people should be aware it can be extremely volatile and I do worry about potential losses that investors can suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKCuOO"&gt;The Treasury Department has sought to calm cryptocurrency advocates, telling reporters that it would not interpret the “broker” language as including miners or developers. Still, many cryptocurrency advocates argue that the promise is not enough and that future administrations could reinterpret the bill’s underlying definition more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coqtvP"&gt;“I appreciate that it seems to be Treasury’s intention to get this right, and we look forward to engaging in any regulatory process in the years to come,” Jerry Brito, Coin Center executive director, said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1430234583572832257?s=20"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. “But please don’t accept the narrative that folks in crypto are overreacting about this provision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W3F7f"&gt;As the House moves forward on the infrastructure package, national security officials are raising the alarm that the cryptocurrency language could force illicit cryptocurrency transactions underground, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/infrastructure-bills-cryptocurrency-measures-risk-pushing-criminals-further-underground-11629883800"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday. More regulation could “push illicit use and criminal actors deeper into anonymizing methods and corners of the internet that would make it more difficult for law enforcement,” Jeremy Sheridan, US Secret Service investigations office assistant director, told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available from Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jujf_oe1-miW9JPf5b3L0h8ttoA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774151/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1e39Lc"&gt;Walmart is offering gamers a chance to get a PS5 and Xbox Series X today, Wednesday, August 25th, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. That’s when the first wave of consoles will be made available, but the retailer has been known to release a few consecutive waves every ten minutes (12:10PM, 12:20PM, etc.) As always, try to sign in before things get started and enter your address and payment info to make the checkout process as speedy as possible. You may have better luck getting a console if you load up the site, and simultaneously have the page open within Walmart’s mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCxCfF"&gt;If you’re searching for the Sony PS5, Walmart has &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $499.99 version&lt;/a&gt; that has a Blu-ray disc drive for game discs and movies, as well as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $399.99 digital version&lt;/a&gt; that lacks a disc drive and, as a result, is cheaper and a bit lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="b7gFNX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPfDeE"&gt;You can stock up your cart with a few PS5 games and accessories from Walmart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0tUI1W"&gt;Whether you’d rather have an Xbox Series X, or heck, you’re trying your luck at getting two consoles today, Walmart will have it in stock at 12PM ET alongside the PS5. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model costs $499.99&lt;/a&gt; and, like the PS5, it features a Blu-ray drive for game discs and movies. It also features a larger 1TB SSD compared to the Series S that ships with 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AM19yE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVPrQ"&gt;We recommend picking up a second controller while you’re at it, like this &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-Shock-Blue%2F265882360%3FfindingMethod%3Dwpa&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shock blue-colored wireless model&lt;/a&gt; that costs $59. Otherwise, your next purchase should be an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which gives you instant access to download a dizzying amount of games. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New subscribers can get their first month for just $1&lt;/a&gt;, then it’s $14.99 per month to get online multiplayer, as well as access to Game Pass on both PC and console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60P10G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;A solid wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt; might also be something that’ll make your time gaming more enjoyable. Good luck today!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s ‘Tudum’ fan event will bring trailers, interviews, and announcements for its originals on September 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/La3pqAs8_J8YujDfx4nkTlW_zHU=/197x0:2201x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773698/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_10.17.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JoKu4R"&gt;Netflix is hosting its own online fan event for the first time on September 25h. The event is called “&lt;a href="https://www.tudum.com/?lang=en"&gt;Tudum&lt;/a&gt;” (as in the onomatopoeia of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV3HUDMQ-F8"&gt;Netflix’s iconic logo sound&lt;/a&gt;), and promises an “exciting day full of exclusives and first looks,” for some of its most popular series and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQOJZG"&gt;The three-hour event (which starts at 12PM ET) will include “breaking news and ... first looks, new trailers and exclusive clips during interactive panels and conversations with the creators and stars from Netflix,” and feature over 70 shows and movies on Netflix, including &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Old Guard&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Umbrella Academy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rAetFs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0aoURo_eMI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OFiuxE"&gt;Additionally, Netflix will be hosting three pre-show events before the main stream starting at 8AM ET: one for Korean series and films, one for Indian movies and shows, and one for anime content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzNk9t"&gt;The shift toward major, branded fan events like this has started to become increasingly common, helped along by the uptick in online events caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399490/dcs-fandome-virtual-event-convention-digital-batman-justice-league-film-gaming"&gt;DC’s FanDome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465657/netflix-geeked-week-how-to-watch"&gt;Netflix’s Geeked Week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1263077012299628545"&gt;Disney Plus’ National Streaming Day programming&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;livestreamed WitcherCon event&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly becoming the home for the kinds of creator and cast interviews, trailer reveals, and announcements that would have been commonplace at events like San Diego Comic-Con. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViD7Bd"&gt;Tudum marks the latest move in that direction; after all, with Netflix already offering so much content, why would it want to risk sharing the stage when it has enough news and trailers to fuel an entire event just for its own shows and movies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKju9P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to remove (but not delete) unneeded Google contacts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOC2zmwnQESflY6HUe54ro0zMXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773668/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MTu3gm"&gt;My friend (and occasional writer for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.androidintel.net/about/#jr"&gt;JR Raphael&lt;/a&gt; has a newsletter in which he recently wrote about cleaning up your Google Contacts list by deleting old and no-longer-wanted entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A92iBc"&gt;What a good idea, I thought. But. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRztD1"&gt;Unfortunately, I am something of a hoarder when it comes to contacts. After years as a tech journalist, I have who-knows-how-many business contact listings, many of which are completely out of date. But although it’s likely that a lot of these people have moved to different companies and different email addresses, I feel I should keep the entries — what if I come across them at some point and want to check where I knew them from? Or what if they still work there even though it’s been several years and I want to say hi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bcJT4"&gt;There is another reason that I am reluctant to delete certain contacts — an unfortunate one. As the years go by, my contact list has begun to include friends and relatives who are no longer with us — and I find that I am loath to remove those names from my list. It’s not logical, or reasonable, but to me it feels like a sort of rejection. In 2015, in an article titled “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/opinion/sunday/my-digital-cemetery.html"&gt;My Digital Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; writer Rob Walker expressed it this way: “The convenient-by-design act of deleting the name of a dead friend with a simple tap or click can feel like overtly participating in removing that person from the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPxDWY"&gt;The result of all this is a Google contacts list that has several hundred names in it, many of which belong to people I haven’t contacted in a long time, or whose entries I simply don’t want to delete. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJA5PN"&gt;I’ve found a couple of ways to bring some order to Google Contacts without permanently losing the names, numbers, and other information from people. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CjtTac"&gt;Hide your excess contacts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYkRd"&gt;Google has a weird way of getting names off your main contact list: you “hide” them. I put “hide” in quotes because what you are essentially doing is moving that entry from your main contacts list to an “Other contacts” list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bl7Je4"&gt;“Other contacts” contains entries from all the various people to whom you’ve sent emails or from whom you’ve received them. For that reason, it can be a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; list — but since it isn’t usually in view, if you move your older contacts there, they won’t clutter up your main contacts list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA7dRB"&gt;You can find your “Other contacts” on &lt;a href="https://contacts.google.com/"&gt;the desktop version of Google Contacts&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the left-hand list of labels. (On the mobile version of Contacts, you can’t see your “Other contacts” list, but if you search for a specific contact who is in that list, they will come up in that search.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FCgXf"&gt;Here’s how to move one or more contacts to the “Other contacts” list using the Google Contacts web app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Xyqm4o"&gt;Hide a single contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="40Qdhz"&gt;Cursor over the contact listing so that it’s highlighted, then click on the three dots to the right of the entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WZkWJL"&gt;Select “Hide from contacts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Hide from contacts” will put an entry in the “Other contacts” list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MkDoo2lSy8eV6LW_6qJ4x_kPTtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803255/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_3.29.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hide from contacts” will put an entry in the “Other contacts” list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7CsxK"&gt;Hide several contacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8mIy90"&gt;Click the icon for each contact you want to hide; the icon will turn into a checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZVcqK"&gt;When you’ve selected all the contacts you want to hide, click on the three dots at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="99Jzq4"&gt;Click on “Hide from contacts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To hide several entries, check them off and click on the label icon above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uBSU0NknyKUZweIdneMwamLVy9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803257/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_3.29.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To hide several entries, check them off and click on the label icon above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8gtNyb"&gt;Incidentally, if your “Other contacts” list is in itself too unwieldy, you can stop Gmail from adding names to it every time you send or receive an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s4FkMe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TGjOho"&gt;In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Create contacts for auto-complete:” and check “I’ll add contacts myself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WtyIeG"&gt;Export and delete your excess contacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jNsZYg"&gt;If you want to really clean up your contacts list, but don’t want to lose the info for those contacts, you can export them into a separate CSV or vCard file. Once they’re safely stored, you can delete them from your Google contacts list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qcV10"&gt;If you’re like me, you probably have more excess contacts than you want to deal with in one sitting. So here’s the way I found to handle it. (Again, this is using the web interface for Google Contacts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1Cn5Zz"&gt;In the left-hand column, scroll down to and click on “Create label.” Choose a suitable name (I named mine “Bye bye”).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Create a label to identify the contacts you want to export." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxqdr68FaT3N5Pok0prG7WRuQUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803220/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.00.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create a label to identify the contacts you want to export.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="DZJtoa"&gt;Spend as much time as you need going through your contacts list. Add that label to any entry that you want to move out of the list. The fastest way is to check off any entries you want to label, click on the label symbol above, select the label you created for this purpose from the pop-up, and then click on “Apply.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you haven’t culled your contacts list for a while, you may have a lot of entries to label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJon9P4utwmhyZ-t-eNjJaewOFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803227/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.17.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you haven’t culled your contacts list for a while, you may have a lot of entries to label.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NMEsge"&gt;When you’re ready to export everything you’ve put under that label, click on the label on the left side of the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aJeFHY"&gt;Scroll down the same left-hand column and click on “Export.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can export your contacts as part of a CSV file or as vCards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkvTTNirfe4BFYy6aJiP6ta7vxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803229/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.23.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can export your contacts as part of a CSV file or as vCards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IdVkMx"&gt;The label that you chose should be at the top of the pop-up window. If it isn’t, you can click on the small arrow to the right of the label and select the correct one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lf28oc"&gt;You can export your contacts as CSV files formatted for either Google or Microsoft Outlook, or as iCards (if you are importing to iOS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1bZexi"&gt;Once you’ve got CSV or iCards files, import them into a spreadsheet or other app where you can have access to them if you need to. For example, I imported mine into a Google Sheets file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iMIRPM"&gt;Once you’re happy with your export, go back to Google Contacts and click on the label you created for your exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ll3vhO"&gt;Click on the delete button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once they’ve been exported, you can delete all your excess contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dh_sSy64QTLQ5YwZDpfqvdpV9r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803233/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_11.51.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once they’ve been exported, you can delete all your excess contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="eQQZPp"&gt;You have a choice to delete just the label (in which case, all those entries will still be there) or delete both the label and all entries that have the label. Select the latter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="M1yWVh"&gt;Now you have cleaned up (at least somewhat) your contacts list — and all the contacts that you still wanted to hold onto are safe and secure in another file where you can find them if you ever need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J24Rx9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52Uoh3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Best Buy stores will have Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs available tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F0mOZtCg6t48LqyNszLtbwcbHmM=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773568/twarren_20210601_4611_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2PB3g"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics cards are next to impossible to find in stock, but Best Buy is offering PC gamers an opportunity to buy one on Thursday, August 26th. Select store locations will have stock, and if you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750089234402385290" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find your local store on this page&lt;/a&gt; by using the drop-down options, it’ll be among the locations getting some GPUs for Thursday’s restock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cdHtS"&gt;You can’t just show up at any time of the day and pick one up. In order to be eligible to buy one, you’ll need to arrive at your store before 7:30AM local time and queue up. That’s the time when Best Buy employees will give one ticket to each person in line until there are no more tickets. If you get a ticket, Best Buy says it guarantees that you can purchase one graphics card, so be early to ensure you get a ticket and that you can get the GPU you want. If you miss out this time, Best Buy seems to do these restock events every month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD5Wjy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/a-massive-restock-of-nvidia-rtx-30-series-gpus-is-happening-at-best-buy-tomorrow/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GPURestock/status/1430292215365050372" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@GPURestock&lt;/a&gt; claims to have internal information that lays out the exact GPU models that will be available at each of the participating Best Buy locations, and how many each will have on hand. However, some replies to the tweet linked above dispute that the information is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fom2G"&gt;So, just arrive as early as you can and there’s a decent chance that you’ll get the graphics card you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An August Wi-Fi Smart Lock being used to lock the door." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOhWdGMo9pQ0UU9fAFAzCeClcpY=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773450/August_Wi_Fi_Smart_Lock_Silver_trex5942_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The latest version of August’s lock is smaller and more discreet.  | Photo: August&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dc1F4p"&gt;August’s latest Wi-Fi Smart Lock is on a special discount today through &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Faugust%2Dsmart%2Dlock%2Dwi%2Dfi%2D4th%2Dgen&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal082521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. This small, discreet smart lock is on sale in both black and gray colorways for $199, and you can use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE20&lt;/strong&gt; to take an additional $20 off the sale price while supplies last. This brings the Alexa-enabled August lock down to a new historic low price of $179, which is an exceptional deal for an app-connected smart lock that can be easily retrofitted to your existing deadbolt without the need for a locksmith. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WlwTdO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9758101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IU4NYr"&gt;Continuing our run of great smart home deals, the Eufy Wi-Fi Video Doorbell 2K is at its all-time low price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R3WY95C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This wired doorbell is great if you’re looking to step into the smart home waters without diving too deep into your wallet, as it does not need a monthly subscription of any kind. The Alexa-ready Eufy also records 2560 x 1920 resolution video and provides some basics that other companies often charge for, including notifications and prerecorded responses, rendering it a great entry-level device. It’s currently on sale for $110, but after you clip the on-page coupon, the price sinks to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0pCPyF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xDRnPr"&gt;One of the best deals on the newest pieces of tech has made a return. &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals082521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot once again&lt;/a&gt; has the recently-released Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 for $25 off. You have all the color options of white, graphite, olive, and lavender available to choose from for $125. The only caveat to keep in mind is that these have a 90-day warranty from Woot in lieu of a warranty directly from Samsung. This is a great value for active noise-canceling earbuds — the Galaxy Buds 2 offer great sound, wireless charging, and ANC in a discreet package — and you rarely get the chance for a nice discount on gear that just dropped.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l5JII8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nxzXr"&gt;If you’re looking for a cheap tablet, Amazon’s recently released Fire HD 10 is available right now as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet-productivity-bundle/dp/B08XMBMW3H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a Bluetooth keyboard case and a 12-month subscription to Microsoft Office 365. This effectively gives you the keyboard case and Office 365 subscription for just $20 over what the ad-supported, 32GB base tablet would normally cost, regardless of which of the four colorways you choose. It’s not exactly a productivity powerhouse — for an inexpensive alternative, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;we suggest a Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; for most people — but it is a viable option if you want to stream movies or do some light work with Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NLj6la"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IDI0qd"&gt;In addition to being the pack-in controller for the Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox controllers have for years been the de facto standard for PC gaming thanks to native support in Windows 10. Thankfully, if you don’t have one or would like to pick up a second controller, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal082521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%2F8xn59crbsqgz%2FHG3Q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is selling&lt;/a&gt; the latest iteration of its wireless controller in carbon black for $10 off. For those that prefer splashes of color, Microsoft is also offering the vibrant “shock blue” and “pulse red” models, both of which are currently going for $5 off. In addition to support for Xbox consoles, these controllers support Bluetooth as well as wired connections via USB-C, and the hybrid D-pad is satisfyingly clicky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XmIxrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some must-have accessories for your Xbox Series X or Series S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550830/xbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E8tzb4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQjnQB"&gt;If you rank the visual performance of your video games over counting pixels, the LG UltraGear 27GN750-B might be the ideal display in this price range. With a 240Hz IPS panel and 1920 x 1080 resolution, not to mention 1ms response time and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, you can experience incredibly fast, smooth graphics that are devoid of distracting screen tearing. Luckily, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B0841787BZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering&lt;/a&gt; a $123 discount on the 27-inch monitor today, dropping it to an all-time low of $277. Both PC and console gamers can jump in, too, as the monitor features dual HDMI ports to complement its DisplayPort connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhjqSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717207"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGgESu"&gt;Now if you are the type that believes the more pixels the merrier, the 2560 x 1440 resolution sibling to this monitor from LG is also on a great deal. You get many of the same features like 1ms response time, a similar port selection, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility with just a small sacrifice of 144Hz refresh rate in exchange for that higher QHD pixel count — all for about $21 more on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B08LLD2QXJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Sotqu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10429642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TquK4v"&gt;Other great deals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TjZiXX"&gt;The whopping &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1527826-REG%2Fapple_32_pro_display_xdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22639744%2Faugust-lock-eufy-video-doorbell-xbox-controller-amazon-fire-lg-monitor-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch Apple Pro XDR Display&lt;/a&gt; with nano-texture coating is currently receiving an equally whopping $500 discount from B&amp;amp;H, shaving a healthy bit off its lofty, $5,499 price tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oltjNP"&gt;Amazon is offering discounts on a variety of its fast-charging GaN wall chargers, including a  single-port USB-C 30W charger in black for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087MFL8DM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$17&lt;/a&gt; and a four-port USB-C / USB-A 100W charger in black for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087MDYP24?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;. There are other discounts to be had on a range of models in various sizes, wattages, and colors.&lt;/li&gt;

Use promo code &lt;strong&gt;SDCODEFS &lt;/strong&gt;to get $100 off on the 48 x 24 inch all-black desk in your cart, bringing it down to around $139 before tax. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s drone delivery service Wing hits 100,000 deliveries milestone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZZndyEoAqxwUSc_29hcmDsVw9c=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773369/72699748_556579681764775_2732760482103427072_n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Z6zwh"&gt;Wing, the drone delivery company operated by Google-parent Alphabet, is about to rack up 100,000 deliveries. The company says it will pass the threshold in the next few days, a significant milestone for a technology that has nevertheless yet to prove its utility at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLdnoz"&gt;Drone deliveries began to catch the public imagination in the early 2010s as consumer quadcopters fell in price and AI control systems became more reliable. Then, in 2013, Amazon made wild promises about making drones a standard part of its delivery empire. But so far the technology has mainly found success at a much smaller scale: delivering high-value but physically small items like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11367274/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-medicine-blood"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcvDiq"&gt;Wing’s success, though, hints that one future for drone deliveries might lie in the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmN4Co"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more than 50,000 Wing deliveries have been made in Logan, Australia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lZfpVt"&gt;Wing currently operates in three countries: Australia, the US, and Finland. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. Logan is home to around 300,000 residents, and Wing’s service is accessible to just over a third of this population. Users can download the Wing app and order a &lt;a href="https://wing.com/australia/logan/"&gt;small selection of goods&lt;/a&gt;, including coffee, groceries, sushi, cakes, pet food, and sportswear. Deliveries are generally made in under 10 minutes, and Wing’s record for a delivery is two minutes and 47 seconds from order to arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MalrvdN5EmZB0r6rr-9z-9w1KQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A fleet of Wing delivery drones perform autonomy tests first thing in the morning&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qU8dxk"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;via email, Wing spokesperson Jonathan Bass said Wing’s expansion in Logan shows that the company “can build a safe, scalable service that communities will embrace.” Said Bass: “There are hundreds of cities around the world just like Logan in terms of size: New Orleans, USA; Manchester, England or Florence, Italy, just to name a few.” He noted that more than 2 billion people live in cities with populations of 500,000 or fewer, though he also added that Wing has ambitions to operate in larger cities, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf5YmF"&gt;Part of the reason for Wing’s success seems to be the specifics of its design. Wing’s drones can operate as both fixed-wing aircraft and hovering copters. Unlike Amazon’s delivery drones, the aircraft also don’t need to land to drop off goods. Wing’s craft fly to their location, descend to a height of seven meters (23 feet), and then lower their packages on a tether, automatically releasing them onto the ground. A recent report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;about Amazon’s struggling delivery drone program&lt;/a&gt; in the UK identified the need for the company’s drones to physically land on the ground as a major engineering challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/El0e3MCquXDXiN4v9P_iZQqRy2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804325/120200849_809350503154357_8323104168818065800_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing’s drones lower their packages down to the ground on a tether. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KgQRVp"&gt;All drone delivery methods, though, limit the technology’s customer base. In densely populated urban areas, customers are unlikely to be able to locate a suitable delivery location at their house. Wing users, for example, need to find “small areas without overhanging trees, power lines or other obstacles, typically in the front yard, backyard or driveway” to receive a delivery, says Bass. These are in short supply for many city residents, including those of Florence, Italy — one of the locations Bass himself mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO4s70"&gt;It’s also not clear if the economics of drone deliveries will make sense at a larger scale. Bass says he’s “extremely bullish” about the potential profitability of Wing, and that drone delivery is “significantly less expensive to scale than existing ground-based delivery methods,” but such claims need to be proven through growth and profits. For the moment, drone delivery is still a fledgling technology, but it might be growing up soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Gamescom’s Opening Night Live stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnSWQxhGU7UrqV95SerBsDzu2fc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773389/Vanguard_Reveal_04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0SdeJU"&gt;Gamescom is usually the biggest in-person video games conference, but it’s happening virtually for the second year straight due to the pandemic. That may be disappointing to people who wanted to go to Cologne, Germany, but the online presentation makes it a lot easier for viewers at home to see all of the highlights. Geoff Keighley’s two-hour-long Opening Night Live event is focused on doing just that, providing new Gamescom game announcements, trailers, and guest appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALaRF6"&gt;As for what you can expect, Keighley promises a walkthrough of a full level from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631315/call-of-duty-vanguard-release-date-trailer-sledgehammer-ps5-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s campaign playing on the latest consoles; some big news about &lt;em&gt;Splitgate&lt;/em&gt;, the portal-based competitive FPS title that’s been popular lately; an update on &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&lt;/em&gt;; an unveiling of the next &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt;; along with some other surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k39uxX"&gt;What time does Opening Night Live begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F9XpdM"&gt;For some people, Opening Night Live won’t actually be taking place at night. It starts at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 7PM BST, so you can tune in during a midday work break (your boss won’t notice that you’re gone for two hours, right?), or right after work, depending on where you are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAJ0u6"&gt;Where can I watch Opening Night Live?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o1I5N5"&gt;This event, like many other game event streams, is available to watch on multiple sites, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lqD2vHSyzo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (embedded above), &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1413136045537853441"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards/videos/4701579209854910"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Rogan, confined to Spotify, is losing influence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b83oin-gTmGN_z69My3vW14VzAM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773233/acastro_210824_4719_rogan_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Verge investigation shows how going exclusive stunted Rogan’s power&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fR8dNl"&gt;When Spotify decided to try to become the biggest podcasting platform in the world, it knew it needed a nuclear weapon: Joe Rogan. The comedian turned podcasting icon has become impossible to miss and a force in the industry. He’s hosted legitimate politicians like Bernie Sanders and wannabes like Kanye West, smoked a joint with Elon Musk, and schmoozed with huge celebrities like Dave Chappelle and Miley Cyrus. With a self-asserted reach of more than 200 million monthly downloads in 2019, Rogan is one of the biggest — if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; biggest — podcaster in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUBwXU"&gt;Spotify hoped he would bring much of that audience along with him when he signed exclusively to the platform in 2020 in a reported $100 million deal, giving it the reach and power needed to take over the podcasting industry. Although Spotify hasn’t given specific numbers detailing Rogan’s listenership since he came on board, it has repeatedly boasted about his success. The company confirmed that he quickly became the platform’s biggest podcaster after jumping to Spotify. He “stimulated new user additions, activated first time podcast listeners, and [has] driven favorable engagement trends, including vodcast consumption,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2020_FINAL.pdf"&gt;a February 2021&lt;/a&gt; earnings release. &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;In April&lt;/a&gt;, it said Rogan’s show had “performed above expectations” in regards to adding new users to the platform and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Md42"&gt;However, a new data investigation by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; finds that the powerful podcaster’s influence has waned since he went behind Spotify’s wall. His show has declined as a hype vehicle for guests, and Rogan’s presence as a mainstay in the news has plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQLyHc"&gt;Because Spotify doesn’t share how many plays each podcast gets, or how many unique listeners regularly tune in, we looked instead at a secondary metric: how much of a promotional boost Rogan gives his guests. To do this, we pulled data from the analytics tool Social Blade to track the Twitter following of every guest who went on Rogan’s podcast between December 2019 and July 2021. Guests generally see a surge of new followers after appearing on the show, with some gaining as many as 18,000 new followers in the week following their chat, and that effect has grown over time as &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; gained popularity. While we can’t attribute every new follower to Rogan — guests might have been on a media tour to promote a new movie or book, for instance — the bump after a Rogan appearance is constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jK8HCn"&gt;We found that prior to going exclusive, from December 2019 to November 2020, Rogan’s guests could expect to gain around 4,000 Twitter followers in the week after their episode premiered. After he went exclusive, that number declined by half to around 2,000, suggesting a drop in listeners. To isolate the effect, we focused on people who had under 500,000 followers when going on Rogan’s show, since bigger names — someone like Dave Chappelle or Elon Musk — were likely to bring more attention to Rogan than vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="t5hLjF"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-01" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7041546/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7041546/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7041546" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hx8Bqv"&gt;You can see the totality of our findings below. We plotted the average number of followers gained month by month. The drop doesn’t look monumental, due to the presence of a couple outlier months, but broadly, you can see that following Rogan’s move to going exclusive, his guests gain fewer followers on average. Even the best months as a Spotify exclusive show only rival the worst months when his show was widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="EzxsMQ"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7041938/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7041938/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7041938" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijEVu8"&gt;We attempted to look into this for Instagram, as well, but Social Blade only had data on about half of the guests — not enough to create a complete picture of the trends. (Still, we saw that the number of followers gained on Instagram declined significantly for those available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucX9IT"&gt;There could be various explanations for the monthslong dip. People might be listening to fewer podcasts post-pandemic, or Rogan fans could have coincidentally stopped using Twitter. But the timing of the dip still aligns with his switch to Spotify exclusivity, suggesting Rogan has lost dedicated listeners. Presumably, the people who took action after an episode and actually followed guests were his most engaged. Now there’s likely fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzocMA"&gt;You can see the same story play out in more detail when looking at guests who were on the show multiple times. Comedian Andrew Santino, who has been on Rogan’s show nine times over the years, appeared twice in 2019, once in 2020, and then once in 2021. Those first two appearances in 2019 netted him over 1,100 followers each. That gain jumped to nearly 1,700 followers in 2020. But in 2021, when Rogan was exclusive to Spotify, the number of followers he added dropped by almost half, to under 900. (For comparison, in the week before he went on Rogan in 2020, Santino gained 1,173 followers on his own, so Rogan gave him a bump of 500 more followers the week after. In April 2021, he gained 772 followers the week before his appearance — Rogan only gave him a bump of 116 people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaxbIs"&gt;We can see a similar trajectory play out with three other guests. Comedian Annie Lederman saw a drop of nearly 50 percent on her most recent guest appearance, as did podcaster and author Michael Malice. Comedian Mark Normand did, too, with a drop of over 50 percent from his latest appearance in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="aQ9iEf"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042063/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042063/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042063" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz2PD"&gt;Despite likely losing listeners in his switch over to Spotify, Rogan’s show still appears to be reaching more people than it did in prior years. Podcaster Bret Weinstein, for example, went on the show in February 2018, June 2020, and June 2021. He gained around 22,000 followers in June 2020, a significant jump over the 4,000 or so he gained in 2018. In June 2021, he gained 18,000, which is still a drop but not as significant as the ones we see in January or April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL4iLR"&gt;Rogan’s reach could be dipping for a number of reasons. The show used to benefit from posting full episodes to YouTube, which usually received millions of views each and often led to snippets going viral on other platforms, like Twitter. But the YouTube channel now just hosts clips, which don’t always break the million-view milestone. Rogan also used to have visibility in other podcasting apps, which is important because not everyone uses Spotify. It’s possible that social media algorithms, and YouTube’s in particular, also helped Rogan and his guests gain a following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dgw8za"&gt;Spotify declined to comment on this report or offer any sort of numbers around Rogan’s performance. Rogan’s team did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8sfb6"&gt;But this lack of reach is also having an effect on Rogan’s broader relevance. Google Trends data shows that searches for his name spiked regularly in 2020 with interest remaining relatively high throughout the year. As soon as he went exclusive, however, those searches dipped. This could be because people used to search Rogan’s name to find his episodes, but it could also be that inside Spotify, his controversial comments — often the cause of spikes in interest around Rogan — aren’t reaching as many ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="PRzVWE"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042161/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042161/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042161" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktbOpX"&gt;In 2021, spikes of interest around Rogan are much fewer and farther between. One of the biggest occurred in April when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"&gt;discouraged young adults&lt;/a&gt; from getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which speaks to the importance these controversial moments have on Rogan’s reach and ability to drum up broader interest. While these controversies boost his relevance, they often put Spotify in a position of having to defend its star talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1tVa7"&gt;We can see this play out on Rogan’s YouTube channel, too. When he would post entire episodes to his YouTube page, Rogan averaged around 265,000 subscribers per month in the year before going exclusive, according to Social Blade data. After he went exclusive in December 2020, that dropped to around 100,000 a month. This shows how going exclusive limits the reach and potential impact of these shows’ stars. (For reference, YouTube’s biggest stars, like Pewdiepie, grew by millions of subscribers per month, despite having tens of millions more subscribers than Rogan, so Rogan likely would have continued growing at a faster clip had he continued posting full episodes to the platform.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="3wk3fU"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042247/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042247/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042247" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNHLJ4"&gt;Meanwhile, many of Rogan’s fans haven’t been happy about the exclusive change. When &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; transitioned from something people could find on most any podcast app — other than Spotify — and YouTube, to a show only available on Spotify, people got confused, upset, and claimed to drop off as listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HXn7h"&gt;“For the past three years, listening to JRE was my healing ritual which made me relax and amused any time I felt tired and hopeless, the only sane voice I could listen to without any ulterior motives of the corporate media (I even began using Youtube Premium just to listen to JRE undisturbed by ads),” one person &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/k59r6m/the_day_jre_was_taken_away_from_me/"&gt;wrote on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, saying Spotify isn’t available in their country, but YouTube is. “Now I have to search around for illegal downloads and cope with what’s left on the Youtube Channel, which might get removed in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31CEvV"&gt;Another person said they tune in less now that it’s on Spotify. “I’m not sure what it is, maybe YouTube just feels more open and intuitive, but I find myself listening WAY less,” they wrote &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/kfotxa/anybody_else_tuning_into_jre_less_even_with/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. “I just haven’t been able to do that as much with Spotify. Maybe it’s the missing comment section? Maybe it’s a me problem?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0A2EW"&gt;Taken altogether, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s data findings suggest that Rogan has lost impact and relevance since going exclusive to Spotify. A sizable portion of his audience likely didn’t follow him when he made the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WhUF4h"&gt;Even still, Spotify has continued to secure exclusive deals with big names. Most recently, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Alex Cooper of &lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;Dax Shepard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, both of whom, if Rogan is any indicator, will likely see a drop in their listener base. For Spotify, however, the deals might be worth the tradeoff if people migrate to its app and it sells ads against these programs. For the podcasters who are receiving multimillion-dollar deals, the money exchanged might be enough to make up for lagging relevancy. At least until their contracts run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhAWFO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otter.ai is available on iOS, Android, and via the web. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Otter.ai&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p id="NN2LRh"&gt;Otter.ai is one of our favorite transcription tools thanks to the accuracy of its machine learning-generated notes. If you’re a paying user, you can also use its Otter Assistant feature to plug into your calendar and automatically join and transcribe meetings even if you’re not there. Previously, Otter Assistant only worked with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;Zoom meetings&lt;/a&gt;, but today the company is expanding it to integrate with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm8uWF"&gt;It’s a handy feature, depending on the platform (or platforms) on which you tend to have meetings. Zoom already offers &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Using-audio-transcription-for-cloud-recordings-"&gt;third-party transcription features&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while Teams has its own &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-a-teams-meeting-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b"&gt;built-in free transcription tool&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re already using one of these services, then the expansion of Otter Assistant won’t mean much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGVFUo"&gt;However, if you’re having meetings across lots of platforms and are already signed up to Otter.ai, then the Assistant tool is a handy way to keep all your notes in one place. Like Microsoft Team’s transcription tool, the notes it generates are also available to view live, letting you search the transcription even while the meeting is still in progress. It does cost, though, and requires an Otter Business plan. That costs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fotter.ai%2Fpricing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22639148%2Fotter-ai-meeting-transcription-assistant-google-meet-microsoft-teams-cisco-webex" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 a month&lt;/a&gt; and gets you access to a bunch of other features including custom vocabulary, audio imports, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
