    <title>Your car may be recording more data than you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtxG6atqyJobMoGrfUbU_73N17Q=/0x0:3120x2080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590524/DSCF1984_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6j1vbE"&gt;When we think about privacy and who can access our location data, we’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;focusing on our phones&lt;/a&gt;, and not on the machine that actually takes us places: our car. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/snitches-wheels-police-turn-car-data-destroy-suspects-alibis-n1251939"&gt;recent report from NBC News&lt;/a&gt; goes into just how much data is collected by our vehicles, and how it can be used by police and criminals alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5Urso"&gt;Your car, depending on how new it is and what capabilities it has, could be collecting all sorts of data without your knowledge — including location data, when its doors were opened, and even recordings of your voice. The NBC article uses the example of Joshua Wessel, a man who’s been charged with murder because the victim’s truck has a recording of his voice at the time of the killing. The report also looks at a company called Berla Corp., which has built a business out of extracting that data on behalf of police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRxXKD"&gt;In broad strokes, it’s hard to guarantee any kind of data protection, simply because cars collect so much sensitive data. Berla’s software boasts the ability to read the unique IDs of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices that had connected to a car’s infotainment system, as well as call logs, contacts, and text messages. But infotainment data isn’t all it can read — it can also look at the logs kept by the car’s internal computer, revealing when specific doors were opened, as well as providing a location log from its built-in GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKZeNP"&gt;It’s not just police that are able to get at this information. NBC mentions an Australian man &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-06/ract-employee-pleads-guilty-to-using-app-to-stalk-ex-girlfriend/11678980"&gt;who used an app to access live data from his ex-girlfriend’s Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;. Not only was he able to access live information about the car, he was also able to control it, remotely turning it on and off and opening windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7j5MSu"&gt;I’ve seen firsthand how people don’t think about all the information their car keeps. I recently bought a used one, and it turned out that the dealership hadn’t wiped any of the previous owner’s information. I could’ve easily seen their phone number and home address if I wanted (and I had to see what they had named their phone in order to delete it from the system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpm5WK"&gt;The heart of the problem is that we’re sharing our private data with more and more devices, and the systems we rely on to keep that data safe keep getting more complex. If we really want to deal with the issue, we may have to take a hard look at our cars, and start thinking about how much data they really need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2023, you won’t be able to fly most drones in the US without broadcasting your location</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhqij0APxyjLbj5N5qjzss8HxNc=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590221/DJI_Phantom_3_Skyscraper.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GggEW5"&gt;If you intend to fly a drone in the US, you’re going to want to pay attention: &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) just issued&lt;/a&gt; the single biggest set of changes to US drone law since the agency first took an interest in the technology. With the proper license, you’ll soon be able to fly at night and over people. But the biggest change is this: in 2023, it may be illegal for you to fly some drones &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; unless you retrofit them with their own broadcasting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw76Yi"&gt;In 2022, the US government will require every new mass-produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds (0.25kg) to broadcast your location — and I do mean your location, not just the location of your drone. You’ll also be broadcasting an identification number that law enforcement can cross-reference with your registration number, as well as your drone’s speed and altitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmERIS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA is casting it as a digital license plate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZIrov"&gt;It’s all part of a new “Remote ID” standard designed to give the FAA and law enforcement a handle on what’s actually flying around in the skies, and it makes sense we might want something like that, considering &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone/"&gt;the current system&lt;/a&gt; only requires you to slap a sticker on your drone that nobody’s going to be able to see while it’s flying through the air. This way, law enforcement can theoretically figure out who’s flying any given drone dangerously and shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO5vaL"&gt;But the Remote ID rule doesn’t just apply to brand-new drones: in 2023; it’ll be illegal to fly your existing drones without that same broadcast. There’s no grandfathering clause for older drones, no exemption for home-built racing drones, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re flying it for fun or even just flying it indoors. You’ll either need to retrofit it with a new broadcast module or only fly it in a specially designated drone flying zone called an “FAA-Recognized Identification Area,” according to the new rules. No such areas yet exist — the FAA will be accepting applications for the new zones in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPGfcc"&gt;It’s also noteworthy the FAA isn’t saying &lt;em&gt;precisely how &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;how far&lt;/em&gt; these drones need to broadcast their identity, largely leaving it up to manufacturers to figure out the best way to do so over the next 18-20 months, which is when new drones sold in the US will have to comply. “At this time, no means of compliance have been FAA-approved,” writes a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RETcYc"&gt;For a DJI-style drone that already packs plenty of technology and already connects to your smartphone, it might theoretically be as easy as sending an additional signal every so often, but it depends on what the FAA decides to approve in the end. DJI declined to comment for this story, which makes me wonder if there’s some wrinkle I’m missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="220vtP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does “broadcast” mean? TBD&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDCkam"&gt;It is worth noting that while &lt;a href="https://content.dji.com/we-strongly-support-drone-remote-id-but-not-like-this/"&gt;DJI railed against the FAA’s original proposal&lt;/a&gt; that might have required every drone to broadcast their Remote ID over the internet, the final rules explicitly don’t require an internet connection, and suggest that manufacturers might simply use short-range Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Aw6Zs"&gt;Here’s self-flying drone maker Skydio’s statement: “We are reviewing the FAA’s new rule on remote identification, which comes into effect in roughly 30 months. There is no immediate impact on Skydio customers. We are working closely with the FAA and taking steps to ensure that our current and future products will be in compliance with the new framework.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP709d"&gt;If it does prove difficult to add these broadcasts. or if people become worried about revealing their location, it could change the way drones are made and sold. Companies like DJI already try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;keep some drones under the 0.55-pound weight limit&lt;/a&gt; so buyers don’t have to legally register them with the FAA. Now, more drones are likely to follow suit, and manufacturers of cheaper flying toys might think twice about crossing that weight limit as well. Even racing drones designed to shed as much weight as possible may now need to factor a possible Remote ID transmitter into their build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxZM3q"&gt;And just because you’ve got a Remote ID transmitter doesn’t mean you can take an eye off  your drone, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;The Visual Line of Sight rule&lt;/a&gt; still applies. “Persons operating a drone with a remote ID broadcast module must be able to see their drone at all times during flight,” writes an FAA spokesperson, who also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there’s no exemption for home-built drones. “[FAA-Recognized Identification Areas] are the only locations unmanned aircraft (drones and radio-controlled model airplanes) may operate without broadcasting remote ID message elements without other authorization from the FAA,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9ibgH"&gt;If you’re a professional, licensed drone operator, there is some very intriguing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183830/faa-drone-regulations-usa-crowds-night"&gt;long-awaited&lt;/a&gt; news today alongside the Remote ID rule, though: the FAA has decided to finally allow you to fly drones over people, at night, and in some cases even over moving vehicles without applying for a special exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsfOWb"&gt;Flying at night requires additional training and anti-collision lights “that can be seen for 3 statute miles and have a flash rate sufficient to avoid a collision.” Flying over people depends on how dangerous your drone is in terms of weight and sharp propeller blades. There are four categories of drone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="srK1x7"&gt;Category 1 eligible small unmanned aircraft must weigh less than 0.55, including everything on board or otherwise attached, and contain no exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin. No FAA-accepted Means of Compliance (MOC) or Declaration of Compliance (DOC) required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lm0rpG"&gt;Category 2 eligible small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 11 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects. Requires FAA-accepted means of compliance and FAA-accepted declaration of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsBjo7"&gt;Category 3 eligible small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 25 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects. Requires FAA-accepted means of compliance and FAA-accepted declaration of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPxRI5"&gt;Category 4 eligible small unmanned aircraft must have an airworthiness certificate issued under Part 21 of FAA regulations. Must be operated in accordance with the operating limitations specified in the approved Flight Manual or as otherwise specified by the Administrator. The operating limitations must not prohibit operations over human beings. Must have maintenance, preventive maintenance, alterations, or inspections performed in accordance with specific requirements in the final rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SbT4RN"&gt;You can’t fly a small Category 1 or Category 2 drone over people unless it’s got a Remote ID transmitter, while Category 3 can’t be flown over “open-air assemblies of human beings,” only private areas where people are either under covered structures or have been warned that a drone will be flying over. Regardless, you’ll need a Part 107 permit to fly at night or over people at all, which means taking a test and getting licensed. These specific rules should go into effect in about two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hkpKq"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/OOP_Executive_Summary.pdf"&gt;the FAA’s executive summary (PDF) on flying over people&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"&gt;full text of the Remote ID rule (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; so you can read for yourself. The FAA has addressed loads of public comments and suggestions in there, so it’s worth a read if you’re wondering why they chose to go this way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s one-night Ratatouille musical will star some of Broadway’s biggest names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDIAuKEWkY38ZWqyV-COS0kHjoU=/44x0:607x375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590199/Seaview_Work_Featured_Images_Ratatouille_650x375.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HMOKY8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; has some big Broadway talent on board for its January 1st streaming performance. Adam Lambert, Wayne Brady, Kevin Chamberlin, Mary Testa, and Priscilla Lopez will play key roles, with Tituss Burgess starring as Remy, the sophisticated rat who loves fine food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qgye8m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;COULDN’T GET ANY BETTER! &lt;a href="https://t.co/UeJdEqR70z"&gt;https://t.co/UeJdEqR70z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Jacobsen (@anEmilyJacobsen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1343618164018589698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSEsFR"&gt;The one-time only performance will benefit the Actors Fund. Based on the 2007 Disney-Pixar movie &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt;, the musical came together on TikTok, with creators composing songs based on the original film, building the “show” piece by piece. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;@e_jaccs&lt;/a&gt;) made the original “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;Remy the Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt;” song for TikTok, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;composer Daniel Mertzlufft&lt;/a&gt;, created the very Broadway-esque &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678"&gt;arrangement of Jacobsen’s song&lt;/a&gt; that really started the ball rolling for a full-blown show. Honestly it’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York Post’s Hunter Biden laptop source sues Twitter for defamation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWMXWqiSQlaGWUTzPKEZ6OHg7xk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590133/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sgz1TR"&gt;A computer repair shop owner cited in a controversial &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; story is &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.583882/gov.uscourts.flsd.583882.1.0.pdf"&gt;suing Twitter for defamation&lt;/a&gt;, claiming its content moderation choices falsely tarred him as a hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qntc35"&gt;John Paul Mac Isaac was the owner of The Mac Shop, a Delaware computer repair business. In October, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that The Mac Shop had been &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/11/repair-shop-owner-at-center-of-hunter-biden-saga-defends-himself/"&gt;paid to recover&lt;/a&gt; data from a laptop belonging to Joe Biden’s son Hunter, and it published emails and pictures allegedly from a copy of the hard drive. After the &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/15/look-behind-ny-post-headline-about-joe-biden-and-u/"&gt;sourcing and conclusions&lt;/a&gt; were disputed, Facebook and Twitter both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4%5C"&gt;restricted the article’s reach&lt;/a&gt;, and Twitter pointed to its ban on posting “hacked materials” as an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2AVir"&gt;Mac Isaac claims Twitter specifically made this decision to “communicate to the world that [Mac Isaac] is a hacker.” He says that his business began to receive threats and negative reviews after Twitter’s moderation decision, and that he is “now widely considered a hacker” because of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDpBtX"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272066/social-media-bias-laura-loomer-larry-klayman-twitter-google-facebook-loss"&gt;many suits&lt;/a&gt; against social media companies, Mac Isaac isn’t specifically complaining that Twitter removed content — a choice that would be likely protected by the First Amendment. Nor is he claiming other people defamed him &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; Twitter, a strategy &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/twitter-dismissed-from-devin-nunes-defamation-suit-over-parody-accounts"&gt;unsuccessfully pursued&lt;/a&gt; by Rep. Devin Nunes of California. His suit loosely mirrors that of conservative activist Laura Loomer, who &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200416/15055144320/facebook-tells-court-laura-loomers-defamation-allegations-all-target-protected-opinions.shtml"&gt;sued Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for banning her under a “dangerous individuals” policy. (Loomer’s case was &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17143914/loomer-v-facebook-inc/"&gt;dismissed voluntarily&lt;/a&gt; in August.) Basically, his argument rests on the fact that Twitter said the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; report was based on hacked materials, and by extension, it maliciously implied he was a hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPDuJV"&gt;Twitter defines “hacking” loosely to include obtaining documents without authorization, and it didn’t name a specific individual as a “hacker.” The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; said it indirectly obtained its files via Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s attorney, who in turn obtained them from Mac Isaac. Some critics of the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; speculated that Russian disinformation operatives had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/feds-examining-if-alleged-hunter-biden-emails-are-linked-foreign-n1243620"&gt;planted the emails&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t place the blame on Mac Isaac. (These critiques have not been corroborated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJHfe2"&gt;The complaint cites several negative business reviews that criticize Mac Isaac based on the facts of the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;story — but it’s unclear why Twitter should be held liable for those reviews. Twitter also declared a day later that the &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; reporting &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; violate its “hacked materials” policy, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542801/twitter-lifts-ny-post-ban-policy-changes"&gt;rapid series of policy shifts&lt;/a&gt; around the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prZxyK"&gt;Mac Isaac is nonetheless demanding $500 million and a public retraction from Twitter. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump administration appeals yet another TikTok ruling </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iNjLQwiwFE7vqnX-TVHpEs7Wbb0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589682/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XTW5RK"&gt;The Trump administration has gained some &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-losing-election-lawsuits-36d113484ac0946fa5f0614deb7de15e"&gt;experience losing in court&lt;/a&gt; recently, and has suffered setback after setback in its stance that TikTok should be banned in the US. Still, its pursuit of the video sharing app continues. On Monday, the Department of Justice filed an appeal of a judge’s order that blocked restrictions on TikTok in the US from taking effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFXAWp"&gt;US District Judge Carl Nichols issued an order December 7th that blocked the Commerce Department’s restrictions on TikTok, which would have prevented new downloads of the app from US app stores. Nichols’ order followed an October order from US District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542641/tiktok-ban-commerce-department-blocked-november-12-influencers"&gt;who issued an injunction&lt;/a&gt; against the ban. In that case, three content creators had argued that a TikTok ban would have a negative effect on their income. And on Monday, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200922/6896727_0__30750.pdf"&gt;DOJ appealed Nichols’ decision&lt;/a&gt; to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbbp1N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A US ban on TikTok seems less and less likely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S9Nait"&gt;The TikTok-Trump saga began back in August, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;President Trump issued an order&lt;/a&gt; saying the security concerns about TikTok and WeChat, both China-based apps, constituted a national emergency. He invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the president to ban transactions between US and foreign entities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369753/bytedance-tiktok-trump-china-app-privacy-90-days"&gt;President Trump then issued an order&lt;/a&gt; August 14th giving parent company ByteDance 90 days to either sell or spin off its TikTok business in the US. That order was set to go into effect on November 12th and would have halted the app’s US operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6eMI"&gt;On September 18th, the US Commerce Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department"&gt;issued an order&lt;/a&gt; to block downloads of the app in the US. But a day later, the president said he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21437850/president-trump-approves-oracle-tiktok-partnership-bytedance-china-ban"&gt;had approved “in concept”&lt;/a&gt; a bid from cloud computing giant Oracle to become TikTok’s “trusted tech partner.” That deal called for creating a new entity, TikTok Global, which would be based in the US and take over processing and storage for all US-based TikTok users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjbfqS"&gt;But then the Trump administration... kind of forgot about the whole thing, it seemed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;TikTok filed a petition November 10th&lt;/a&gt; seeking a 30-day extension of the November 12th deadline, and the company said it had received “no substantive feedback” from the Trump administration for some time. The administration gave an extension until November 27th, and again until December 4th. Then the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154801/us-government-tiktok-ban-deadline-bytedance-trump-administration-cfius"&gt;said it would not enforce&lt;/a&gt; its own deadline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMgXpU"&gt;What shape the appeal will take in the waning days of a lame duck administration is still to be determined, but a US ban on the app seeks less and less likely to happen. TikTok did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGDzY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a OnePlus 7T for $300 at B&amp;H</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biDnx6girr9OFiVWYJgbRaaeAFM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589443/vpavic_190924_3684_0096.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBH7mo"&gt;The T-Mobile variant of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1600544-REG%2Foneplus_610214661821_7t_t_mobile_smartphone_frosted.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 7T is on sale at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for $300, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-7t-tmo%3Ffrom%3D7t&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;undercutting OnePlus’s own sale&lt;/a&gt; at $350. This matches the lowest price the phone has ever been, so if you’ve been looking for a flagship-specced phone at a budget price, this deal may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqpQD"&gt;This being the T-Mobile variant, there are some caveats that B&amp;amp;H lists on its site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WStSqS"&gt;The OnePlus 7T is an unlocked T-Mobile variant. It may be used in other parts of the world; however, LTE access may be limited or unsupported, depending on the network. Please choose your country/carrier above to confirm the network compatibility of this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGLcV6"&gt;This phone may also be T-Mobile branded and come pre-loaded with T-Mobile firmware and applications. The phone was originally manufactured and locked for T-Mobile, but T-Mobile has since unlocked it for resale. The phone is new and not pre-owned, though the box has been opened in order to unlock the phone. The phone may be used on any compatible carrier; however, certain features like Wi-Fi tethering may not work on other carriers. The phone is also dependent on T-Mobile for software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqxk6w"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540535/amazon-motorola-razr-fingerprint-folding-phones-screen-protection"&gt;don’t like the idea of the phone having previously been opened&lt;/a&gt;, you can also get a fully unlocked version for $350 from B&amp;amp;H, or the T-Mobile locked variant for $350 from OnePlus themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJkAP"&gt;The 7T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20881638/oneplus-7t-review-specs-features-price-availability"&gt;was a good deal when it launched&lt;/a&gt; at $599, and has &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7t-long-term-review-1164176/"&gt;only improved after a year of updates&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth remembering that you’ll be reliant on T-Mobile for those with this version). When compared to the market now, it does lack some features: it doesn’t have 5G, and it’s screen is slower at 90Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;than its successor’s&lt;/a&gt;, which runs at 120Hz. But if you value savings more than those features, you may want to hop on the deal — it expires this Wednesday, December 31 at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After stumbling with one film universe, DC is trying for two</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/byvHL1FNyf9gBN9ekrhH3xaJoUE=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589439/ww_1984.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QiVVr"&gt;There are about to be way, way, &lt;em&gt;way &lt;/em&gt;more DC movies — and some will be released as HBO Max exclusives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq0quV"&gt;Following the release of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;last week, DC Films president Walter Hamada &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/business/media/dc-superheroes-movies.html"&gt;sat down with the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to talk about the studio’s more aggressive release strategy. Starting in 2022, DC Films plans to release up to four films theatrically every year, with one or two extra as HBO Max exclusives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9gED9"&gt;Currently, DC releases about one or two movies a year, and seen mixed success. &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shazam! &lt;/em&gt;failed to perform well, while &lt;em&gt;Aquaman &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;saw impressive box office return. In 2019, Warner Bros. also saw tremendous success with &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;— a movie not tied into the greater DC universe that nonetheless became an unexpected hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt8siH"&gt;Under the new strategy, there will be two cinematic universes under the DC banner: the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and the DC Films multiverse. Films like &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Batman &lt;/em&gt;will exist as part of DC Films’ multiverse, which will be comprised of individual stories based on DC characters that do not tie into a bigger narrative arc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ackat"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under the new strategy, there will be two cinematic universes, essentially, under the DC banner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wrON4y"&gt;Movies like &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman, Shazam!, Aquaman, Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and likely future Superman and Green Lantern movies will fall under the DCEU. Wonder Woman and the gang will have their own stories and then come together in some kind of &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;setting again. This means there can be two different Batman (Batmen?) around the same time: Robert Pattinson can have his own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;adventure in Matt Reeves’ &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Ben Affleck or a new actor can play Bruce Wayne in the DCEU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd46rm"&gt;It’s a familiar concept in comic books, where standalone series like &lt;em&gt;Superman: &lt;/em&gt;Superman: &lt;em&gt;Red Son&lt;/em&gt; can offer a new take on a popular character without affecting overall continuity. And of course, different universes can cross over whenever DC wants, like how Affleck’s Batman might &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299460/michael-keaton-batman-flash-dc-comics-warner-bros"&gt;encounter Michael Keaton’s Batman&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming Flash movie in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WIMrR"&gt;If you’re confused, it’s understandable. In comics, multiverses play out over several issues and series, so there’s more room to get used to the idea. They also tend to work better on TV because the medium allows for longer-form storytelling that can navigate the intricacies of multiverse mechanics. As Hamada told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, no one “else has ever attempted this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDvhDa"&gt;“But audiences are sophisticated enough to understand it,” Hamada said. “If we make good movies, they will go with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFQOhd"&gt;DC Films also plans to release one or two movies directly onto HBO Max. These are considered to be riskier projects, which may not generate the necessary revenue needed to justify a $200 million production budget and another $100 million on marketing. They will, however, help bolster HBO Max subscribers if they work as intended. &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;notes that Batgirl or Static Shock are possible candidates for the straight-to-streaming treatment, but those aren’t confirmed yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoHWPz"&gt;The studio will also use theatrical releases to launch spinoff TV shows, which will stream on HBO Max. &lt;em&gt;GCPD &lt;/em&gt;will stem from &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;is a John Cena-led spinoff based on his character of the same name in James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. “With every movie that we’re looking at now, we are thinking, ‘What’s the potential Max spinoff?’” Hamada told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MT2Sdc"&gt;“What’s the potential Max spinoff?” is a fun sentence to read about a film studio’s development plans for the next decade, and Hamada isn’t the only studio executive with that line of thinking. Studio heads Kevin Feige and Kathleen Kennedy are employing the strategy with their respective studios, Marvel and Lucasfilm, over on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pAyFZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With every movie that we’re looking at now, we are thinking, ‘What’s the potential Max spinoff?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FW4zoB"&gt;It’s an ouroboros strategy: a never ending cycle of content based on popular characters and IP company executives think can drive people to theaters, then streaming services, and back again to theaters. Think of Marvel’s strategy: Doctor Strange as a character ties into &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;which ties back into &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;. The same for Yelena in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(theatrical release)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151121/marvel-hawkeye-tv-show-cast-black-widow-florence-pugh-disney-plus"&gt;appearing in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Disney Plus show). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM0L58"&gt;There are a lot of questions about how this will all work. What about Greg Berlanti’s Arrowverse, for example? And all those other DC shows on the CW? Will they just continue existing in their own space the same way DC Universe’s original series (&lt;em&gt;Titans, Doom Patrol, Harley Quinn&lt;/em&gt;) do on HBO Max? What if DC Films decides it wants to make a &lt;em&gt;Batgirl &lt;/em&gt;spinoff — do two &lt;em&gt;Batgirl &lt;/em&gt;TV shows just co-exist alongside each other? Remember when Jeph Loeb created an entire Marvel universe on Netflix, Hulu, and ABC — and then Marvel Studios &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/marvel-jeph-loeb-exit-kevin-feige-disney-disney-1202766184/"&gt;effectively scrapped all of it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im037h"&gt;All we know for certain is there are going to be way more DC films and TV shows than what we currently have. Include Marvel’s ramped-up production on Disney Plus series alongside its film slate, and fans will be facing a sea of superhero titles practically every month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New Yorker report on the failed response to COVID-19 in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l9YisI9GDMrz9_UrV_XZcuB9EtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589274/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PM90VC"&gt;There are three moments this year that determined the scale of the COVID-19 catastrophe in the United States, argues &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; staff writer Lawrence Wright in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2021%2F01%2F04%2Fthe-plague-year&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22202867%2Fcoronavirus-response-us-failure-cdc-tests-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sweeping, searing look&lt;/a&gt; at the country’s year spent fighting (and failing) against COVID-19. The magazine is devoting an entire double-issue to cataloguing those missteps and the many other mistakes made by officials that set us on a path towards hundreds of thousands of deaths from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gG4D7"&gt;The first happened January 3, when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spoke with his Chinese counterpart about a new respiratory virus. Redfield wanted to send a CDC team to China, but was turned down. Instead, the CDC was kept out of China, and the agency was slow to understand the risk the virus posed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJAEDy"&gt;“Redfield is convinced that, had CDC specialists visited China in early January, they would have learned exactly what the world was facing,” Wright writes. “The new pathogen was a coronavirus, and as such it was thought to be only modestly contagious, like its cousin the SARS virus. This assumption was wrong.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZJqRV"&gt;Next came the problems with the coronavirus test kits developed by the CDC. They didn’t pass quality control checks, but were sent out to labs anyway. The failure meant the US spent the month of February essentially flying blind, with too few tests to know how much coronavirus was already in the country. That had a domino effect on other elements of the early response: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znTQmO"&gt;Without the test kits, contact tracing was stymied; without contact tracing, there was no obstacle in the contagion’s path. America never once had enough reliable tests distributed across the nation, with results available within two days. By contrast, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Fseouls-radical-experiment-in-digital-contact-tracing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22202867%2Fcoronavirus-response-us-failure-cdc-tests-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to universal public insurance and lessons learned from a 2015 outbreak of &lt;em&gt;MERS&lt;/em&gt;, provided free, rapid testing and invested heavily in contact tracing, which was instrumental in shutting down chains of infection. The country has recorded some fifty thousand cases of &lt;em&gt;COVID&lt;/em&gt;. The U.S. now reports more than four times that number per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8GNnYZ"&gt;The third turning point was masks. Research showed that they could help slow the spread of COVID-19, but the CDC was slow to recommend them. By the time the agency said everyone should wear masks, they’d been politicized by President Donald Trump and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xv9na0"&gt;The C.D.C.’s sudden reversal, Redfield admitted to me, was awkward: “When you have to change the message, the second message doesn’t always stick.” Worse, when the President announced the new mask advisory, he stressed, “This is voluntary,” adding, “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="juCd6A"&gt;Wright outlines other failures: Trump’s refusal to direct federal aid to governors, for example, and the hydroxychloroquine debacle. He also touches on the one bright spot — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22158376/covid-vaccine-pfizer-public-health-antivirus"&gt;scientific triumph&lt;/a&gt; of developing vaccines at record speed — but avoids any impulse to make the the scale of that success equal to that of the tragedy. Two authorized vaccines that are extremely effective at preventing COVID-19 within a year is nearly unbelievable, but more than 300,000 people have died from the pandemic and the toll continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 announced with Snapdragon 888 and 120Hz OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAEq6xpraw7ojkKZx2URtoWIbOI=/0x0:678x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589222/Xaomi_Mi11_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tA1G3"&gt;Xiaomi has announced their new flagship for 2021: the Mi 11. The Chinese variant of the phone sports a modified design and upgraded specs that give a good look at the kind of high-end features top Android phones will ship with in the coming year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16339/xiaomi-announces-mi11-first-snapdragon-888-device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s bound to be some changes to the European and global versions of the Mi 11, but for now this is an early peek into what’s likely to be 2021’s first major Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaGmfR"&gt;The changes to the design of the Mi 11 in comparison to the Mi 10 appear minor. From the front, the display is slightly larger at 6.81-inches in comparison to the Mi 10’s 6.67-inch screen. That extra space seems to have come from shrinking the bezels of the device (always welcome), while increasing the height and maintaining the curved sides and hole-punch camera on the front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M3vWuAnyO7kt4x45XeYG4-LjsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200423/Xaomi_Mi11_frontback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpmSyt"&gt;What’s more exciting is the 3200x1440 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate on the new OLED display, two features that have fast become must-haves on modern flagships, though of course they’re sorely missed on the latest iPhones. In another notable difference, the Mi 11 will also feature an under-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9GMNo"&gt;The back of the Mi 11 holds the more visible changes. The iPhone X-esque vertical camera “pill” of the Mi 10 is gone, and in it’s place is a thin glass “layer cake.” The Mi 11 features three rear cameras: a 108 megapixel main sensor, a five megapixel telephoto, and a 13 megapixel ultra-wide. The Mi 11 also has faster 50W wireless charging (previously on the Mi 10 Pro) to pair with its 4600mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzbC8h"&gt;Moving from the battery to the rest of the internals, the Mi 11 is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and offers either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. Storage starts at 128GB or 256GB, which is unfortunately still generous in the smartphone world. Like most new smartphones, the Mi 11 also has Wi-Fi 6 and support for 5G. Notably missing from the Mi 11 is a charging brick. The CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, confirmed the Mi 11 will follow in Apple and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;) Samsung’s footsteps in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200610/xiaomi-ceo-phone-no-charger-mocking-apple-iphone"&gt;removing the charging brick from the box&lt;/a&gt; for environmental and cost-saving reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajmHSG"&gt;The Chinese version of the Xiaomi Mi 11 is available for pre-order today, and will start shipping January 1st. The price for the entry level 8GB RAM/128GB of storage model is listed at ¥3999.00 (around $611). Details on the pricing and features of the other versions of the Mi 11 will come at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQTnro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen teases an electric car-charging robot with eyes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/19vCQWozKjfVdWJt0kyJowA8-Cc=/0x0:1515x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589113/Large_12884_VolkswagenGroupComponentspreviewsmobilechargingrobot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Volkswagen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIi6M0"&gt;Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1452"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s made a prototype of the electric vehicle charging robot concept it first showed off in &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/26/vw-electric-vehicle-charging-butler-robot-concept/"&gt;proof-of-concept form in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and that it plans to keep developing the idea. The giant German automaker apparently liked the concept so much that the prototype charging robot looks almost identical to the concept version, complete with blinking digital eyes and R2-D2 noises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hkBii"&gt;The robot — which, shockingly for Volkswagen, doesn’t have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;garish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14832354/volkswagen-sedric-self-driving-van-concept-mobility"&gt;cutesy&lt;/a&gt; name — works simply enough in theory. When you park your electric vehicle in a parking garage, you (or your car) can request to have the battery topped up. The robot unmoors from its docking station, hooks up to one of a dozen or so mobile batteries, which it then drags to your car. The robot plugs the battery in to your car and then returns to its station, ready to field any other charging requests. When your car is done charging (or you return from your errand), the robot collects the battery and brings back to the charging racks, stopping to let other cars and pedestrians pass by along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsVZ6w"&gt;It’s a fun idea, though there are a number of possible points of failure that Volkswagen didn’t address in the press release issued Monday. For one, the charging robot depends on cars being connected to an overall network of some kind (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233085/v2x-vehicle-to-everything-fcc-safety-spectrum-airwaves-wifi"&gt;known in the industry as V2X&lt;/a&gt;, or “vehicle to everything”) in order to communicate with the robot. But that’s an idea that has yet to take hold, and one that is fraught with unglamorous but nevertheless foundational problems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233085/v2x-vehicle-to-everything-fcc-safety-spectrum-airwaves-wifi"&gt;arguing about which standard to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Srf9Et"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMC1H__xL3Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zT2Zth"&gt;Also, calling this version of the charging robot a “prototype” implies that Volkswagen has got a working version, but the company didn’t actually show it in action as part of Monday’s announcement. Instead, Volkswagen merely released a “first glimpse,” involving just a glossy commercial for the robot and a few photos. Automated charging is an idea that Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750154/vw-electrify-america-ev-robot-chargers"&gt;has been toying with for a little while&lt;/a&gt;, and while it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/6/9109027/tesla-model-s-snake-charger-elon-musk"&gt;certainly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/autonomous-robot-electric-car-charge-carl/"&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the few big companies that seems to be actively engaged in making it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCpnRq"&gt;Volkswagen is already building out large fast-charging networks in the US (Electrify America) and Europe (Ionity) as part of its larger atonement for the Dieselgate scandal. Something like this robot, then, might seem like a more complimentary charging solution. But fast-charging networks are not really meant for routine use; rather, most electric car owners will do the bulk of their charging at home or in parking structures. So finding a way to make that easier is a worthy goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tLYye"&gt;The charging robot likely won’t be the ultimate solution there, either, even if it winds up working well. Volkswagen is already trialing a different idea in parts of China and in its home city of Wolfsburg, Germany that involves putting batteries inside what looks like a more standard charging station pillar. This allows the charging station to build up a store of energy that can be used to fast-charge electric vehicles, even if the local grid isn’t otherwise capable of doling out that much electricity in one go. Volkswagen said Monday that it is planning a wider launch of these so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2020/04/Flexible_quick_charging_stations_launch_in_China.html"&gt;flexible quick-charging stations&lt;/a&gt;” in early 2021. One downside to these stations, though: no blinking eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
