    <title>Google Fi is adding a less expensive unlimited plan with more limitations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZmf1FtrGnXCdqqTuV29BTLvd0w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170096/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s MVNO wireless service adds another, more conventional plan option.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STPl05"&gt;Google Fi has announced a basic, less expensive unlimited plan called Simply Unlimited in addition to its current unlimited offering, now called Unlimited Plus. The new plan costs $60 per month for a single line and forgoes a couple of features available on the more expensive plan: international data and mobile tethering. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20869599/google-fi-launches-a-more-traditional-unlimited-plan"&gt;second time&lt;/a&gt; the MVNO has introduced a new unlimited plan, each marking a step toward a more conventional wireless plan pricing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkjUS2"&gt;Simply Unlimited covers the expected basics of an unlimited cellular plan: unlimited data, calls, and texting in the US. While the newly dubbed Unlimited Plus (still $70 per month for one line) provides high-speed data and texting in over 200 countries for international travelers, Simply Unlimited only includes data and text in Canada and Mexico. The new plan doesn’t include hotspot tethering either, whereas Unlimited Plus includes high-speed tethering (subject to the plan’s 22GB overall limit on high-speed data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CCCtXg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="T6LFvG"&gt;Offering a cheaper plan without tethering tracks with other basic unlimited plans from the big wireless carriers; they tend to include slower tethering or none at all. Fi seems to be taking one more step toward conventional wireless offerings as an alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782436/project-fi-data-only-sim-deal-wireless-lte-tmobile"&gt;the unorthodox Flexible plan&lt;/a&gt; it launched with six years ago — and which is still available today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 is CD Projekt Red’s biggest game ever, despite its disastrous launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/essEGtdiJZkkil_n0CSOCWCFvEI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169934/Cyberpunk2077_Im_your_fixer_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cj0Mq9"&gt;Despite &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s disastrous and bug-filled December 10th launch, the title was “the largest game in CD Projekt Red’s history,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/press-release-2020-results.pdf"&gt;the studio said on Thursday (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. The game sold 13.7 million copies in 2020, according to CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAwH7a"&gt;We already had a pretty good idea that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been a major financial success for the studio. On December 9th, one day before the game’s launch, CD Projekt Red announced that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; had accrued &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1336941257965375489"&gt;8 million preorders&lt;/a&gt;. One day after the game’s release, CD Projekt Red said digital preorders &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-65-2020/"&gt;had recouped&lt;/a&gt; all of the game’s development and marketing costs. And the studio said that the game had sold more than 13 million copies as of December 20th in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/"&gt;memo shared on December 22nd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtK1gL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; drove massive sales even though its launch was a huge mess. The game had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;bugs and issues on many platforms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;ran particularly poorly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;, forcing CD Projekt Red to quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s performance and fan outcry were so bad that Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;yanked the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; just one week after launch, and months later, it still hasn’t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR4VyW"&gt;CD Projekt Red also said on Thursday that its hit RPG &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; sold more than 30 million copies, making 2020 “the second best year in [the game’s] history with regard to the number of copies sold.” In addition, the studio committed to releasing PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S-optimized versions of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin’s new Venu 2 watches have better battery life and more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Garmin’s new Venu 2 (left) and the smaller Venu 2S (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xyetjxsii5JQFc0TBe9XMMOR4Y8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169899/garminvenu2series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Garmin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BLEnDr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd, 1:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated the first paragraph to reflect that Garmin wouldn’t disclose how long its introductory price of $319.99 will last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W9nLX"&gt;Garmin has upgraded its premium Venu smartwatch for 2021 (via &lt;a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/04/garmin-venu2-venu2s-smartwatch-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DC Rainmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/garmins-2-new-smartwatches-want-to-make-the-casual-athlete-more-advanced/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It now comes in two sizes instead of a single 43mm-sized model. The 45mm Venu 2 houses a 1.3-inch 416 x 416 OLED screen. For smaller wrists (or those who just prefer a less wrist-dominating device), the 40mm Venu 2S has a 1.1-inch 360 x 360 OLED screen. Both watches have an optional always-on mode, and they &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F707538&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397488%2Fgarmin-venu-2-2s-smartwatch-fitness-tracking-health-sports-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available now for an introductory cost of $319.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is $80 cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20848816/garmin-venu-vivoactive-vivomove-gps-sport-watch-price-date-specs"&gt;original Venu&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in late 2019. Garmin hasn’t shared how long this price will be in effect (the product pages mention a $399.99 asking price), and the company declined to disclose how long this lower price will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpzlUH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doubles the battery life in some cases versus the original&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ1Pkp"&gt;Other than the differences in case sizes, there isn’t much else distinguishing the Venu 2 lineup visually from the predecessor. They’re slick-looking touchscreen wearables with Gorilla Glass 3-covered touchscreens that feature two buttons. One of the biggest gen-to-gen improvements is its battery performance. The original Venu could last five days in smartwatch mode, but Garmin’s bigger 45mm Venu 2 watch doubles it (and then some) to a claim of 11 days of operation if you’re just using it for getting phone notifications with light usage otherwise. If you’re using its built-in GPS and streaming music from the watch to your headphones via Bluetooth, Garmin predicts up to eight hours of battery life, up from six in the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Garmin Venu 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Clyf6laprC1EB2cADmDCCmYQqTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462289/garminvenu2big.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of the larger Venu 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zaFDAK"&gt;Surprisingly, the smaller 40mm Venu 2S also has better battery life than the original, with 10 days of use expected in smartwatch mode or up to seven hours in GPS mode with music. &lt;a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=A1gzB6SLZF6e9nnyZOfFM6"&gt;Garmin has a whole page that backs up how it makes predictions on battery life&lt;/a&gt;, telling you what to expect depending on the kind of activities you’re doing. Garmin is also touting faster recharging for both models, with 10 minutes of charging giving you up to one day of use in smartwatch mode or an hour of GPS usage with music. Both models can store up to 650 songs from Spotify, Amazon Music, or Deezer, up from 500 in the Venu and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451145/garmin-venu-sq-music-edition-smartwatch-gps-spotify-nfc-wearable-blood-oxygen"&gt;2020 Venu Sq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdo9z1"&gt;The Venu 2 watches are packed with sensors, featuring a heart rate sensor, GPS (GLONASS and Galileo), a wrist-based pulse ox sensor to measure blood oxygen, a barometric altimeter for altitude, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer, thermometer, and an ambient light sensor. Each watch also features NFC for the Garmin Pay contactless payment feature. These watches work with iOS and Android, but only on Android can you respond to text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPPPue"&gt;In terms of new software features coming to the watches, Garmin’s Sleep Score will give you an aggregate score based on tracking your sleep stages, heart rate, stress, respiration, and your blood oxygen levels. The Venu 2 series can estimate your “Fitness Age” based on your level of activity and can guide you through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and advanced strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>12 EA games get 120fps boost on Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_A9focfeEoITHBaOez4YR87lWqw=/0x1:1670x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169884/fpsboostlede.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rRhfeH"&gt;Microsoft is enabling its Xbox FPS Boost mode on 13 EA games, with 12 now supporting up to 120fps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287001/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-feature-games"&gt;The FPS Boost feature&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Series X and Series S consoles is designed to make existing games run better. While Microsoft has improved frame rates with some backward-compatible games, FPS Boost specifically bumps performance to improve older games without developers having to put in any additional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRWGoH"&gt;Titles like &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt; are all getting support for up to 120fps today. These updates come just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328089/microsoft-xbox-series-x-bethesda-frame-rate-boost-game-pass"&gt;Microsoft enabled FPS Boost on a number of Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCeS1A"&gt;Here’s the full list of games getting support for up to 120fps with FPS Boost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Bo7GNF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GEISc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S0LOVO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DPXj55"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirror’s Edge Catalyst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fjwsfg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YTXP12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I1gXMJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VNsguP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QX1plq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qqentU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EkoxuL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OHRRRj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unravel 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VSw9Es"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea of Solitude&lt;/em&gt; is also getting FPS Boost mode with support for 60fps. There are now &lt;a href="https://majornelson.com/fpsboost/"&gt;23 games in total&lt;/a&gt; that include FPS Boost mode support, and the 13 EA titles are all available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Before Baccalaureate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Www6qWwd0MmN3hSdPzTwuHf7wU=/50x0:5950x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169817/1232456637.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Marcus Brandt/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its practices — including links to excerpts of the source code, which he’d posted on Pastebin. Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen sent Johnson a direct message on Twitter requesting that he remove the code from Pastebin, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. After Johnson refused, Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice, and three of the tweets were removed. (They were reinstated after &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on the controversy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK8Nb1"&gt;In its lawsuit, the EFF is arguing that Johnson made fair use of Proctorio’s code and that the company’s takedown “interfered with Johnson’s First Amendment right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgOb4R"&gt;“Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,” said EFF Staff Attorney Cara Gagliano &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nj7LRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"},{"title":"An ed-tech specialist spoke out about remote testing software — and now he’s being sued ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9pKcoR"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that schools use to watch for cheating on remote tests. Its use exploded last year with the rise of remote learning; the platform proctored over 16 million exams. The software records students through their webcams as they work and monitors the position of their heads while they take exams. It flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. It also enables instructors to track the websites students visit during the exam period and to bar them from functions like copying and pasting text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbshw"&gt;Students and instructors around the country have volleyed numerous criticisms against Proctorio, claiming it violates student privacy and has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374386/proctorio-racial-bias-issues-opencv-facial-detection-schools-tests-remote-learning"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against marginalized students. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the service (and four others) in December, calling it “inherently invasive.” A coalition of US senators, including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), cited similar concerns about Proctorio in an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IrTuL"&gt;Proctorio has engaged critics in court before, although more often as a plaintiff. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Last October&lt;/a&gt;, the company sued a technology specialist at the University of British Columbia who made a series of tweets criticizing the platform. The thread contained links to unlisted YouTube videos, which Proctorio claimed contained confidential information. The lawsuit drew ire from the global education community: hundreds of university faculty, staff, administrators, and students have signed an &lt;a href="https://blog.communityofpraxis.ca/2020/09/03/in-defence-of-ian-linkletter/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; in the specialist’s defense, and a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for his legal expenses has raised $60,000 from over 700 donors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgbqJ1"&gt;“We disagree that sharing confidential information is the same thing as criticism,” Olsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;at the time. “Posting these kinds of things...it risks students learning how to circumvent the software, and it risks the safety and security of millions of students who use the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXDX7n"&gt;Proctorio did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the EFF’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s Autopilot is ‘easily’ tricked into working without anyone in the driver’s seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o743ZQ_A3Y9M-Wzo3aRIbXdYPGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169738/tesla_model_y_3605.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NlenRC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; said Thursday it was “easily” able to trick Tesla’s Autopilot system to operate without anyone in the driver’s seat. The publication’s test came amid questions about the safety of the company’s advanced driver assist system in the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;a fatal crash in Texas&lt;/a&gt; in which authorities said there was no one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJSFDZ"&gt;Using a weighted chain attached to the steering wheel to simulate the pressure of the driver’s hands, two &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; researchers were able to use the steering wheel dial on a Tesla Model Y to accelerate from a full stop, and then “drive” around on a closed-course test track for several miles — all while sitting in the passenger seat and backseat. They stopped the vehicle by again using the dial to bring the speed back down to zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnl2mK"&gt;Tricking the Tesla to operate without someone behind the wheel was as simple as keeping the driver’s seatbelt buckled, not opening the driver’s side door during the test, and using the weight to simulate hands on the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h9Prz1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The car drove up and down the half-mile lane of our track, repeatedly, never noting that no one was in the driver’s seat”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8evNI"&gt;“The car drove up and down the half-mile lane of our track, repeatedly, never noting that no one was in the driver’s seat, never noting that there was no one touching the steering wheel, never noting there was no weight on the seat,” Jake Fisher, &lt;em&gt;CR&lt;/em&gt;’s senior director of auto testing, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/autonomous-driving/cr-engineers-show-tesla-will-drive-with-no-one-in-drivers-seat/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It was a bit frightening when we realized how easy it was to defeat the safeguards, which we proved were clearly insufficient.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szgk3l"&gt;Fisher also warned against trying to similarly trick Tesla’s Autopilot, noting this experiment should not be attempted by anyone but a trained professional. In addition to conducting the test on a closed course, &lt;em&gt;CR&lt;/em&gt; also had safety crews standing by and never exceeded 30mph. “Let me be clear: Anyone who uses Autopilot on the road without someone in the driver seat is putting themselves and others in imminent danger,” Fisher says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FwKoXO"&gt;&lt;iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/1078702682/2ab51b8c-6ce0-4c90-beb2-9a8912cc085e_default/index.html?videoId=6249708456001" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vOAYX"&gt;The track on which &lt;em&gt;CR &lt;/em&gt;conducted its test had painted lanes, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed Autopilot needs in order to operate. His response to the crash in Spring, Texas, in which two men were killed in what authorities have described as a driverless Tesla Model S, noted that the road they were on did not have painted lines. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LyftGyft/status/1383917552762384386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383917552762384386%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fn7bw5g%2Ftesla-owners-are-investigating-the-crash-that-killed-two-people"&gt;some Tesla drivers have demonstrated that Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; works on roads without painted lanes. Federal crash investigators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;are now examining&lt;/a&gt; the crash in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5KtiU"&gt;Musk also claimed that data logs recovered from the crashed Model S “so far show Autopilot was not enabled.” But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1384263339576987657"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that Autopilot can turn off unexpectedly without notifying the driver. “Autopilot makes mistakes, and when it encounters a situation that it cannot negotiate, it can immediately shut itself off,” Fisher said. “If the driver isn’t ready to react quickly, it can end in a crash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oeS0gj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Research has shown that Autopilot can turn off unexpectedly without notifying the driver&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UipkUP"&gt;Tesla warns that drivers need to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times, though the automaker famously refuses to include a more robust driver-monitoring system (like infrared eye tracking, for example) to ensure its customers are following safety protocols. Autopilot is considered a Level 2 “partially automated” system by the Society of Automotive Engineers’ standards, which requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpChSy"&gt;But this hasn’t stopped many Tesla owners from abusing Autopilot — sometimes going so far as to film and publicize the results. Drivers have been caught sleeping in the passenger seat or backseat of their Teslas while the vehicle speeds down a crowded highway. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445168/tesla-driver-sleeping-police-charged-canada-autopilot"&gt;Canadian man was charged with reckless driving&lt;/a&gt; recently after being pulled over for sleeping while traveling at speeds of 150 km/h (93mph). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQVvD3"&gt;Autopilot has been proven by federal traffic investigators to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849499/tesla-autopilot-crash-culver-city-2018-ntsb-report"&gt;contributed to a number of fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the past, and the families of deceased drivers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750715/tesla-autopilot-crash-lawsuit-wrongful-death"&gt;have sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; for wrongful death. For his part, Musk blames driver overconfidence. “When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt;Musk said in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9E3QCa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports &lt;/em&gt;has had a bumpy relationship with Tesla over the years. In 2015, the publication &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/27/9214263/tesla-model-s-p85d-consumer-reports"&gt;broke its own rating system&lt;/a&gt; in its effusive praise of the Model S P85D. But that love affair started going south almost immediately when it surveyed about 1,400 Tesla owners and used that data to project a “worse-than-average overall problem rate” for new buyers over the life span of the vehicle. As a result, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9576335/tesla-model-s-reliability-consumer-reports"&gt;it pulled its coveted “recommended” rating&lt;/a&gt; for the Model S. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234740/consumer-reports-tesla-model-3-recommend-remove"&gt;It did the same for the Model 3&lt;/a&gt;, citing “declining reliability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows 10 taskbar widget starts rolling out today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK8NCzsTuFhnOfwbKA_xjrbG9zY=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169660/windowstaskbarwidget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 10 taskbar feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tn5FAP"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out its biggest change to the Windows taskbar in years. A new weather and news taskbar widget will be available in Windows 10 starting today, offering weather information directly in the Windows taskbar. The widget also expands to include a feed of news, stocks, sports, and weather information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKFSCp"&gt;The mini-feed of content only appears when you activate the widget, and it can be fully personalized with the latest sports news, headlines, and weather information. Microsoft is using its Microsoft News network to surface news and content from more than 4,500 sources, and the company will use AI to learn what news is relevant to you when you dismiss or like stories in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5NGFVpk9V5uVMl4ZwrOKTDfCmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461782/News_and_interests___GIF_1___Article.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The taskbar widget includes a feed of news.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQJuWT"&gt;If you don’t care about this new widget, then it’s easy to disable, or you can simply keep the weather information appearing in the taskbar. This new widget will start rolling out today to those who opt into the April 2021 cumulative update preview for Windows 10, and broader availability will happen over the next few weeks as the May Windows security update starts rolling out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXnySW"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217153/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature"&gt;testing this taskbar widget since January&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s surprising to see it appear early ahead of the company’s planned 21H1 and 21H2 updates to Windows 10 this year. Microsoft is in the final stages of testing for the 21H1 update, which is expected to launch next month, but this new taskbar widget will be available to Windows 10 users running on version 1909 or above. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation Now will roll out support for 1080p streaming starting this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M7JG9BORZklJQTCr22JOoXBSf6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169484/vpavic_191127_untitled_0037_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJO8VA"&gt;Sony will begin rolling out support for 1080p streaming with PlayStation Now beginning this week, upping the streaming quality from the cloud gaming service’s previous 720p cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4XRMA"&gt;“The rollout will occur over the next several weeks across Europe, US, Canada, and Japan, where PlayStation Now is available,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1385247101500731398?s=20"&gt;Sony said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IUQRpx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PlayStation Now will begin rolling out support for streaming 1080p capable games this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rollout will occur over the next several weeks across Europe, US, Canada, and Japan, where PlayStation Now is available. &lt;a href="https://t.co/OEHWHtMTw8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OEHWHtMTw8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1385247101500731398?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fGVxK4"&gt;In its tweet, Sony says support will roll out for “1080p capable games,” but it hasn’t yet shared a list of games that can hit the higher resolution. We’ve asked the company if it can share more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuyBxH"&gt;Allowing some PlayStation Now games to stream at 1080p brings the service on par with some of Sony’s cloud gaming competitors. Amazon’s Luna currently tops out at 1080p, while Google’s Stadia can hit up to a 4K resolution. Microsoft is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360211/microsoft-xbox-360-xcloud-backward-compatible-games"&gt;testing 1080p support&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUamV1"&gt;I played the entirety of the PlayStation 3 version of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; on my PS4 last year with PlayStation Now streaming, and the service worked without a hitch. The 1080p resolution boost (for games that support it) should be a nice upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is testing a PlayStation video streaming service in Poland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D74vFT9Wn3xgdW74moQxm7rATHU=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169304/ps_plus_video_pass_keyart_01_en_13apr21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5pSrUQ"&gt;Following &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-looks-set-to-announce-playstation-plus-video-pass/"&gt;a leak yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, Sony confirmed that it is testing out a service called &lt;a href="https://spidersweb.pl/2021/04/playstation-plus-video-pass-wywiad.html"&gt;PlayStation Plus Video Pass&lt;/a&gt;, with a one-year trial in Poland that will allow subscribers to stream movies and TV shows, as the company looks at ways to expand its online subscription, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-confirms-its-testing-playstation-plus-video-pass-in-poland/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Game Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHeASp"&gt;Speaking with Polish website &lt;a href="https://spidersweb.pl/2021/04/playstation-plus-video-pass-wywiad.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s global services VP Nick Maguire said that the service would be a streaming app available to PS4 and PS5 owners with an active PS Plus subscription, at no additional cost. The service will include 15 movies and six TV shows owned by Sony Pictures, with more on the way every three months until the trial concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTBZiR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service will include fifteen movies and six TV shows owned by Sony Pictures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnwnKr"&gt;Maguire says that the company decided to hold the test in Poland based on specific data, noting the test will allow Sony to see which titles are most watched and how often PS Plus subscribers use the service. Though, the executive did not comment on whether the service would roll out to other regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlycNG"&gt;PS Plus Video Pass could be a new way for the company to increase the value of its online subscription service beyond gaming as the company does not have a direct competitor to Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which is a Netflix-like subscription service with access to a robust library of digital games available for download and play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JDYEw"&gt;Sony has access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195963/sony-warnermedia-hbo-max-streaming-disney-plus-theatrical-releases-hollywood"&gt;a large library of TV and movies&lt;/a&gt;, including access to anime by way of Funimation and Crunchyroll, the latter of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;Sony purchased in December from AT&amp;amp;T for $1.175 billion&lt;/a&gt;. With the PlayStation Store discontinuing the sale and rentals of movies and TV shows on August 31st, Video Pass could be another way for PlayStation owners to watch movies and shows on their consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
