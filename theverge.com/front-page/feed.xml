    <title>Peak Design’s new magnet-powered phone case system delayed until August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWzo_cLVS7ceJ6Kgj014SpTMMeo=/0x92:2200x1559/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140354/20201018_Sean_Hollister_Verge_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eoaV6S"&gt;Peak Design has &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe/posts/3132766?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users"&gt;announced it is delaying shipment of products&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe/posts/3132766?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users"&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; for Mobile, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;broad range of phone accessories&lt;/a&gt; designed to make it easy to mount your phone on everything from a motorcycle handlebar to a simple dock on your desk. It is meant to be compatible with iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones. Originally targeted for May, the company now expects to be able to begin shipping in August, though some products will also come later. To make up for it, Peak is offering either full refunds for cancellations or discounts on other Peak Design products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6i4Cra"&gt;Peak Design has used Kickstarter to launch everything from camera-focused backpacks to tripods and its original product, an innovative camera mounting clip. But this new project is on a different scale of ambition: it’s multiple products designed to work together in an interlocking system of mounts, wireless chargers, mini tripods, wallets, and cases. Key to the entire system is a combination of magnets and physical locking mechanisms which can differ from product to product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oP81W"&gt;The project apparently started about two years ago, which means that just before the company was running to launch in October of 2020 Apple announced the iPhone 12 — complete with the MagSafe system of cases, chargers, and wallets that connect with magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Some prototypes in Peak Design’s mobile system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQq6znEkQQtz2ySBD1SF_SJs4vI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21971354/20201018_Sean_Hollister_Verge_27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Some prototypes in Peak Design’s mobile system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jbatU0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkoykp"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe system and Peak Design’s magnet system are different, but the company made the call to try to make its system interoperable in some ways with MagSafe. That has meant testing its products across all the different variables it could think of, mixing and matching Peak Design’s big portfolio of products with Apple’s new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfwHer"&gt;That complexity is one of the reasons for the delay, the first in Peak Design’s long history marketing products on Kickstarter. The second is the obvious one: delays introduced from COVID-19. The designers have been unable to travel to the factory to test their designs or go into their local workshop to suss out problems directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELmLDU"&gt;The company expects its first wave to include the most basic products in its lineup, cases and some “core mounts/accessories,” with a second wave coming “later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8l4vYz"&gt;Peak Design will email Kickstarter backers discount codes for its products (20 percent off anything plus 50 percent off a future purchase in the Mobile product line). It also says people who wish to cancel their pledge can email info@peakdesign.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood can’t handle the Dogecoin rally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5auLwHRZvB2DZSfu9i8NbOhJqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140309/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWI7tJ"&gt;Yesterday and today, the enthusiasm for joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin overwhelmed Robinhood, leading to “sporadic crypto order failures and delayed notifications for some customers,” &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/4/16/a-new-generation-of-investors-crypto-and-robinhood"&gt;Robinhood wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr2uD8"&gt;“These interruptions aren’t acceptable to us,” Robinhood wrote in its post. “We believe we’re the most intuitive crypto platform for Dogecoin traders and we’re proud to be a top choice for this community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3avk3"&gt;Robinhood has a history of exactly this kind of whoopsie. In March 2020, there were&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt; three huge outages&lt;/a&gt; which Robinhood has said were due to “&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders"&gt;stress on our infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.” And infamously, in January, Robinhood limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;trades on GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, pissing off the entire internet and getting itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;hauled in front of Congress&lt;/a&gt; in the process because it hadn’t planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;anything approaching the scale of Gamestonk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OWqan"&gt;Look, the app is very pretty and easy to use, but if it fails during the most &lt;em&gt;crucial&lt;/em&gt; buying and selling periods, are users going to stick with it? Whether you make money on your Dogecoin trade matters more than than how nice the app is. Besides,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/14/22383748/coinbase-nasdaq-ipo-direct-listing"&gt; there’s the now-public Coinbase platform&lt;/a&gt; to trade cryptocurrency on anyway — even if it &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-dogecoin-listing-binance"&gt;doesn’t support Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehZ3N7"&gt;The Robinhood post, frustratingly, doesn’t go into the technical details that could have let users know how serious the failure was, or why it happened. I’ve emailed Robinhood to ask for some of these details, and will update if the company responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64RdPy"&gt;In conclusion, I must &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;once again beg for the Robinhood S-1&lt;/a&gt;, which I need in order to live. I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; know what the risk factors section looks like, and if these kinds of outages are significant enough to the company to be listed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5e6Bz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:24PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that Coinbase doesn’t support Dogecoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You ever think about how Asus put out like 40 models of a laptop called the “Eee PC”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pile of netbooks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqkYvDCpI9jjjGTV_Mp-ThmXpes=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140173/pile_o_netbooks.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1JwOdb"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;an Apple event next week&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s looking fairly likely that we’ll see updated models of the iPad Pro and perhaps the iPad Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxpS38"&gt;Which is great, because it made me think about the Eee PC, which was either one of the greatest short-lived success stories in tech history or a collective delusion shared by a handful of late 2000s tech bloggers that never actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Eee PC 701SDX" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MUaxnz9OohZy_IiG9Ak_NDHPLw4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22449734/dims.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Eee PC 701SDX. It had an SD card slot, and an X.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jw4TJi"&gt;There were two products that arrived in 2007 that fundamentally changed computing: one, of course, was the iPhone. The second, obviously more important product was the $399 Eee PC 701. It originally ran a custom Linux operating system that reviewers loved (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/asus-eee-pc-701"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laptop Mag&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Spoonauer said&lt;/a&gt; it was “ten times simpler to use than any Windows notebook”) and was generally heralded as a new kind of computer with tremendous mass appeal. Spoonauer: “Pound for pound, the best value-priced notebook on the planet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4d79D"&gt;Again, this was a weirdo little two-pound plastic laptop that ran &lt;em&gt;a custom Linux distro&lt;/em&gt; that was basically a front for various websites. (We hadn’t invented the phrase “cloud services” yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFTh6T"&gt;Windows getting shown up by Linux was not allowed, so Microsoft did some Microsoft maneuvering, and by January 2008 the Eee PC was running Windows XP instead. It was also part of a larger category called “netbooks,” and we were all made to know what netbooks were.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A blue Eee PC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GemsNYBRMI7fYi6EomiLxLYPBK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22449759/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMDkvMTIvYXN1c2VlZXBjMTAwNXBlMTYuanBn.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;This Eee PC ran a “Pine Trail” processor so Joanna photographed it with pine branches. This was state-of-the-art tech blogging in 2009.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jzBH57"&gt;A little later, Microsoft created something called Windows 7 Starter, which was a hilarious cut-down version of Windows just for netbooks — you weren’t even &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/06/19/oems_cant_brand_windows_7_starter_desktop/"&gt;allowed to change the desktop background&lt;/a&gt;! — and the netbook explosion was unstoppable. My friend (and Verge co-founder) Joanna Stern built the early part of her career obsessively covering netbooks, first at &lt;em&gt;Laptop Mag&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;, and then with me at &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yfABYp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Do you remember when the Nokia Booklet 3G was going to reinvent Nokia? You do not, because it didn’t.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vh59WB"&gt;And there was a lot to cover: at one point Joanna noted that Asus had put out &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-21-asus-eee-pc-1005pe-review.html"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; 20 different models of Eee PC&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;. And that was just Asus! Dell, HP, Lenovo and others all chased after the netbook idea furiously. Do you remember when the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-04-nokia-booklet-3g-review.html"&gt;Nokia Booklet 3G&lt;/a&gt; was going to reinvent Nokia? You do not, because it didn’t. It was very pretty, though. I asked Joanna about this moment in time, and this is what she sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyvYzp"&gt;“I was basically Bono in this ‘I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For’ video. Eee PC after Eee PC. MSI Wind after MSI Wind. Toshiba whatever it was called after Toshiba whatever it was called. I was constantly looking for a netbook that had a keyboard that didn’t require doll hands, a trackpad that didn’t leave a blister on my thumb, a hard drive that didn’t take three days to open Microsoft Word. It was a constant search for the perfect blend of price, portability and power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUCvfr"&gt;Joanna then demanded I embed the actual YouTube video of U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” which is exactly the sort of “wow that was really important once” energy this blog post needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch8I0j"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3-5YC_oHjE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9piM2e"&gt;The netbook explosion was all the more odd because every netbook had the same basic specs, as Microsoft charged more for a standard non-Starter Windows license if a computer had anything more than a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 160GB hard drive. So it was all colors and screen sizes, really. All to run a deeply-annoying version of Windows, on a computer that no one was even remotely claiming could replace a primary PC. By the end of it all, as the chips inevitably got more powerful, enough laptop vendors were telling Joanna that their new netbook-like computers &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; netbooks that she started calling them “&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-31-editorial-the-rise-of-the-notbook-the-fall-of-the-netbook.html"&gt;notbooks&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyVB6o"&gt;And then the iPad came out in 2010, and netbooks were inexplicably such a part of the computing vocabulary that Steve Jobs introduced the iPad &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0XJg74qnvxE?t=478"&gt;by explicitly saying that netbooks were bad&lt;/a&gt;. “The problem is netbooks aren’t better at anything,” is a real thing Steve Jobs said on stage, in order to clearly distinguish the then-new iPad from netbooks. It was important to him! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Steve Jobs looking forlorn about netbooks in 2010" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-du79JlI9Xr5P4fQ0kslY5cuJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22449706/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_4.20.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Steve Jobs looking forlorn about netbooks while announcing the iPad in 2010&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzlsZt"&gt;Did any of this even &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt;? Is this &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;? I remember it all, but I can’t tell if it meant anything, or if we all just believed Microsoft and Intel were so mysteriously powerful that we had to live in their product frameworks and 160GB of maximum hard drive space. Did anyone actually &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a netbook? The only people I ever met who had netbooks were other tech writers; at one memorable trade show my colleague Adi Robertson showed up with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a gigantic gaming laptop &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a tiny netbook, two laptops both perfectly ill-suited for the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldTksI"&gt;I asked Joanna, who is now a senior personal technology columnist at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, about all this, who replied: “Let’s be clear here. Apple’s coming event this week is actually about netbooks. The iPad Pro is an outgrowth of the netbook movement a decade ago.” Was she joking? I don’t know, and she wouldn’t tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwflbH"&gt;Now, of course, there aren’t any netbooks, but everything is a netbook. The iPad is the iPad, with multiple models at various sizes and price points, and a furious ongoing debate about whether it can replace a laptop. (See? It’s a netbook.) Chromebooks exist, and both Apple and Microsoft worry about them in familiar ways. We are surrounded by appliance-like cheap computers that run goofy custom interfaces to cloud services on top of open-source operating systems — that’s an Echo Show, or a Google Chromecast, or even an Oculus Quest 2. Netbooks. Intel is badly in need of a reinvention and Windows itself is diminished; Microsoft would happily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21071108/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-iot-windows-ios-android-future"&gt;call its operating system “Azure Edge”&lt;/a&gt; if anyone would go along for that kind of ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlM9rL"&gt;Did netbooks ever happen? Did netbooks... &lt;em&gt;win?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unK8sp"&gt;Eee, PC. Eee.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Starlink internet service should be ‘fully mobile’ by the end of this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A phone finding starlink satellites" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSmPiM_POynWnu0eMaNj9nGrkVg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140148/1231999016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bwy9dn"&gt;SpaceX’s new Starlink satellite internet service is in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; limited beta testing period right now, but the company is already thinking ahead: as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/spacex-wants-to-connect-starlink-satellite-internet-to-moving-vehicles.html"&gt;first noted by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, SpaceX has filed an application with the FCC for Starlink components that would allow the service to work on moving vehicles. &lt;em&gt;Big&lt;/em&gt; moving vehicles, that is — Elon Musk tweeted that the existing Starlink terminals are too big for Tesla’s vehicles, and the idea is targeted at planes, RVs, trucks, and ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NuJXNj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp;amp; RVs.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1369051431903268865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSA0t"&gt;This would be a big change for Starlink, which right now does not even allow customers to move the existing hardware from address to address — if you can get in the beta, the signup forms are clear that the service is limited to the location you enter at checkout. That’s because the Starlink satellite constellation isn’t fully built out yet, so it’s not a permanent limitation, but it’s still a limitation today, and one that Elon once again clarified today in a tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dRpkhH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp;amp; some key software upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1382842277719003136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DfGY4S"&gt;I actually have a Starlink system that I’ll be reviewing for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming Infrastructure Week — the promise of fast, reliable satellite internet that can compete with America’s various broadband monopolies is very enticing, but early testers have reported mixed results. (Which, again, Elon says will improve.) Let me know if you have questions in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York State just passed a law requiring ISPs to offer $15 broadband</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tr6Ana"&gt;Internet should become a lot more affordable in New York after Governor Andrew Cuomo &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-establishing-first-nation-program-provide-affordable-internet"&gt;signed a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires all Internet Service Providers operating in New York state to offer a $15 a month broadband option for low-income consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PlbUv"&gt;According to NY Assembly member Amy Paulin (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/n-y-to-require-all-internet-providers-offer-low-cost-broadband?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the average price of broadband in New York is currently $50. This new bill caps the price at $15 for regular broadband and $20 for high-speed broadband, but only for those who qualify as low income. That’s still over 7 million people in 2.7 million households &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-establishing-first-nation-program-provide-affordable-internet"&gt;according to a press release from Cuomo’s office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0RxNR"&gt;This is a remarkable move toward making broadband internet the affordable utility most people treat it as. Cuomo’s office told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that for $15 a month ISPs must provide the greater of two speeds: either 25 Mbps down, or the speed of the ISP’s existing low-income broadband service. The former is the same speed defined as broadband by the FCC, and it’s not considered especially speedy. The FCC’s 25 Mbps definition of broadband has remained in place since 2015 and has been criticized as outdated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312065/fcc-highspeed-broadband-service-ajit-pai-bennet-angus-king-rob-portman"&gt;Earlier in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan group of senators called on the FCC to redefine broadband as 100 Mbps down and 100 Mbps up, as that would better reflect how people actually use their internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Zlv4R"&gt;Still, paying $15 a month for 25 Mbps down is a heckuva lot better than paying $50 a month for those same speeds. Better yet, for those living in urban areas such as New York City, where the internet tends to be much faster, &lt;a href="https://www.nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&amp;amp;leg_video=&amp;amp;bn=A03006&amp;amp;term=&amp;amp;Summary=Y&amp;amp;Actions=Y&amp;amp;Memo=Y&amp;amp;Text=Y"&gt;the same bill&lt;/a&gt; caps the price of broadband up to 200 Mbps at just $20 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuOkaU"&gt;In addition to capping the price on internet for low-income households, Cuomo also launched a new website, the &lt;a href="https://forward.ny.gov/find-affordable-internet-options-new-york-state"&gt;Affordable Broadband Portal&lt;/a&gt;, to help people find affordable internet in their area. He also announced a partnership with the Ford Foundation and Google founder Eric Schmidt’s Schmidt Futures to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-launch-connected-ny-fund-provide-no-cost-internet-access-50000"&gt;create the ConnectEd NY fund&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the fund is to provide free internet access to approximately 50,000 students in economically disadvantaged school districts. It’s expected to operate through June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFb1f9"&gt;Cuomo has passed a number of popular pieces of legislation in the last month—including the legalization of recreational weed use. A cynical person might interpret this latest, and extremely good move, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/magazine/andrew-cuomo.html"&gt;another effort to distract from the growing number of scandals surround Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;. But a good thing is a good thing regardless of the motivation, and this appears to be a very good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gcmtld"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 may support a trash bin for deleted files, but it’s messy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwGRT7k80dX4R7yzPf3vrOF1L44=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139760/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NI8o3S"&gt;Google appears to be preparing to add a feature to Android devices that has long been a part of more traditional desktop operating systems: a trash bin (or, if you prefer the way Windows names it, a recycle bin). &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; has been digging into the code for Android 12 to &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-features-leak/"&gt;uncover features that Google hasn’t officially announced yet&lt;/a&gt;, and the latest is a line in the &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-recycle-bin/"&gt;main Settings app for “Trash.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQrPNO"&gt;When you tap “Trash,” Android 12 should pop up a dialog box telling you how much storage deleted files are taking up on your system and giving you the option to empty it. It looks like it should work just like it does on Windows or a Mac, but in practice it’s likely to be much more complicated for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALSwp4"&gt;Android actually got a trash API in Android 11 that apps could use to hide files instead of instantly and fully deleting them, but it seems little used. Google itself appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/files-by-google-1-0-345-prepares-trash-folder-restoring-deleted-files/"&gt;preparing to support it in the Files by Google app&lt;/a&gt;, but so far it hasn’t shown up in the live version of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzDBYd"&gt;So the trash feature already exists in Android 11, but few apps seem to be using it; and even if they did, there’s not yet a way to actually recover trashed files. In Android 12, the settings &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; uncovered don’t appear to offer recovery either, but individual file management apps — like Google’s — could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROc4TN"&gt;Android file management isn’t quite as straightforward as it is on your desktop OS. For example, the newer scoped storage settings mean that files that are “trashed” are technically just hidden in place by putting a period at the front of their file name. Plus, every different Android maker can choose to use its own file management app instead of the one offered by Google — and those apps may or may not support the new trash API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdUG7D"&gt;In short, Android 12 and Google’s own Files app could support trashing and recovering files, but that doesn’t mean any of the apps on Android 12 necessarily will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSt13n"&gt;So: messy. But that’s what happens with any OS that develops over time with newer security models. Ultimately, what we theoretically want is an easy-to-understand trash bin that can be checked for deleted files to recover. Google appears to be pushing Android in that direction, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AE6foa"&gt;The key word here is “pushing,” though. Implementing a feature like a trash / recycle bin requires getting everybody in the ecosystem on board, and Android is a huge ecosystem. Because of the way Android updates are structured, deep system updates that affect hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;take literal years to implement&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, of course, it takes far too long for most Android phones to get the latest version of Android in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHkgUY"&gt;Other features in Android 12 won’t be held back by such complications. It looks like Google will let you call the Assistant by holding down the power button, and is adding new emoji, offering new homescreen layouts, and changing some other minor UI elements. &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-features-leak/"&gt;collected a bunch of the tweaks it has uncovered here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An actual house is an NFT now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfhQZWCxyD1_Senh15QWzvoUupY=/0x205:1216x1016/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139600/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_12.39.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p0h8YY"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01968736"&gt;real estate broker&lt;/a&gt; named Shane Dulgeroff decided to take advantage of the NFT hype. He’s selling a house at&lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/221-Dryden-St-Thousand-Oaks-CA-91360/16482013_zpid/"&gt; 221 Dryden Street, in Thousand Oaks, California&lt;/a&gt; along with an NFT of a psychedelic-flavored video of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XijYAX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dulgeroffnft.com/"&gt;artwork and house&lt;/a&gt; are up for auction &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/2486869023454245507069933349028388716405620900153834793415058191888540499969"&gt;on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;, with a minimum bid of 48 ETH, or almost $117,000. &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/2486869023454245507069933349028388716405620900153834793415058191888540499969"&gt;No one has bid yet&lt;/a&gt;, and the auction closes in seven days. The house previously sold at $746,000, according to real-estate platform Zillow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="e22w1I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dkbvQh"&gt;“It’s less about the significance of the art as it is the significance of us using a platform like this to sell a home,” &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90625777/this-nft-comes-with-an-actual-house"&gt;Dulgeroff told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “The significance that the art will carry, it’s going to be stored in your digital wallet forever as living proof that you purchased the first home ever that was done through any kind of a crypto platform directly. So that’s where the real value is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKSD1h"&gt;NFTs are usually used to support digital goods — for instance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353219/gorrilaz-artist-nft-release-environmental-concerns"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;trading cards&lt;/a&gt;. Currently there are no laws to explain how this might work, or what the taxes will be. “It really is an interesting process navigating the legal side of it, the tax side of it, the transfer side of it to make sure it’s all done correctly,” Dulgeroff told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company. &lt;/em&gt;Perhaps that explains the lack of bids — no one wants to get in trouble with tax collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zQ6g3"&gt;The art that comes with the house was designed by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkiiarens.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388177%2Fnft-house-real-estate-opensea-thousand-oaks-california" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kii Arens&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t the only Arens NFT; &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/to-the-moon-and-beyond-1"&gt;his pop-art confections&lt;/a&gt; inspired by Yusaku Maezawa’s attempted space mission are also up for sale. Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire, announced in 2018 that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa"&gt;planned to go to the Moon with artists&lt;/a&gt;. “I want to be on that spaceship as it travels farther than any human has from Earth,” Arens wrote to explain the inspiration for the NFT set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings series to cost $465 million for first season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (WARNER BROS.)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDWrZMh8ww8MvseCP6WUoy0r7bs=/159x0:1020x574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139471/desolationofsmaug_promotionalstill_22_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The gold necessary to finance the first season of The Lord of the Rings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWQHoJ"&gt;The first season of Amazon’s &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; TV show is &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-cost-465-million-one-season?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to cost the retail giant a frankly difficult to imagine $465 million to produce. Just to save you from having to re-read that, this price tag is for just one season, and that there is not a missing decimal in the above number. “This will be the largest television series ever made,” New Zealand’s Minister for Economic Development and Tourism&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300278243/amazon-may-be-on-the-way-to-new-zealand-as-government-signs-subsidy-deal"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrIvVj"&gt;But this honor was already something of a known quantity, after Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/13/16644782/the-lord-of-the-rings-amazon-television-show"&gt;spent $250 million to secure the rights&lt;/a&gt; to the franchise in 2017, kicking off a round of stories declaring the not-yet-produced show “the most expensive” television production in history, with the big B number circulating its rumored five-season run. This is perhaps fitting, since another episodic &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent production — Peter Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; trilogy — currently holds the record for the most expensive movie production in history, at some $623 million (after tax credits). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObrBEP"&gt;To make a more lembas to lembas comparison, here are some other Big Numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="khBGoa"&gt;The final and most expensive season of that other fantasy TV series, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, cost just $90 million, or &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-game-of-thrones-episodes-cost-for-production-2019-4"&gt;$15 million per episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6wQADd"&gt;Disney spent “&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/budget-of-disney-plus-star-wars-series-the-mandalorian-2019-10"&gt;around 100 million&lt;/a&gt;” on the first season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZkeDOI"&gt;Disney’s Marvel series are reported to cost as much as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/bob-iger-bets-company-hollywood-s-future-streaming-1247663"&gt;$25 million per episode&lt;/a&gt; which, considering there are nine episodes of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, would max out at $225 million. Chump change!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="faB3tS"&gt;Adjusted for inflation, it cost Kevin Costner roughly $300 million in 1995 to build an entire island off the coast of Hawaii for &lt;em&gt;Waterworld.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHXDsm"&gt;The US government plans to spend $451 million in 2021 on lunar exploration, or about one &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aLlLx9"&gt;Of course, being a new show and all, there are some up-front costs to be expected in this first season, like sets and costumes, which may take some of the sting out of future seasons. But that’s really only a concern if you’re thinking as a not-billionaire. With a net worth of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;$193 billion&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s (outgoing) CEO Jeff Bezos can personally ensure the series goes &lt;em&gt;there and back again &lt;/em&gt;(and again and again and again) for some 400 seasons before things start to get a little tight. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board delays decision on Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FoQ2Q4R3ZAbN64uiMFfsJBx_Q0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139369/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmfZI9"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board, the quasi-judicial organization that Facebook set up to review tough moderation choices, announced today that its decision on former President Trump’s ban from Facebook and Instagram will arrive “in the coming weeks.” The decision, which was initially supposed to take 90 days, has been pushed back so the board can review &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;the more than 9,000 comments&lt;/a&gt; it’s received about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UNu9BU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;(2/2): The Board’s commitment to carefully reviewing all comments has extended the case timeline, in line with the Board’s bylaws. We will share more information soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1383058864074063874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXNAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook banned Trump from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; after the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing that “the risks of allowing President Trump to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.” Trump has remained banned from the services, and his attempts to appear in videos on his children’s pages have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360483/facebook-trump-ban-interview-daughter-in-law"&gt;also been blocked&lt;/a&gt;. But the ban was always “indefinite,” and it’s now up to Facebook’s new Oversight Board to make a call about when and how Trump might be allowed to return, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eHz1"&gt;The review of the decision to block the former President is a momentous occasion for the Oversight Board. The board is staffed by an international panel of lawyers and speech experts and is supposed to offer an independent, binding assessment of Facebook moderation decisions. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381499/facebook-oversight-board-remove-posts-appeals"&gt;Anyone can appeal to the board&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a guarantee any case will be taken.) The Board has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;ruled on a handful of cases&lt;/a&gt; — some in surprising ways — but a decision to either reinstate Trump or keep him off Facebook will be heavily scrutinized with pressure on Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to overrule that decision no matter what. If this massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;experiment in platform governance&lt;/a&gt; is to succeed, this is the first major test, with enormous implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dzWJ"&gt;In the meantime, at least they’re reading the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX will build NASA’s lunar lander</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="072kWA"&gt;NASA picked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to receive $2.9 billion to build a lunar lander as part of the Artemis mission to send humans to the Moon by 2024, the agency announced today. It’s a major vote of confidence in SpaceX from NASA — as no other company received money. The contract between NASA and SpaceX is expected to be signed on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxAUKo"&gt;Four astronauts will launch on NASA’s Space Launch System, aboard the Orion spacecraft. From there, two people will then transfer to SpaceX’s lunar lander. They’ll spend about a week exploring the surface of the moon, then get aboard the lander and head back to Orion. SpaceX will have to do an uncrewed flight of the lander before any humans come aboard, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BcsYgE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving the contract to SpaceX &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; is a slap in the face to Blue Origin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wqfcs"&gt;The SpaceX contract is for an uncrewed flight and a single crewed landing. Subsequent landings will be awarded under a follow-up procurement program. NASA said it would begin talking with the industry about the follow-up program next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA48ae"&gt;There were three major contenders for the project. SpaceX beat out Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, working with a selection of other aerospace companies, and Dynetics, a defense contractor. NASA had previously rewarded all three contenders with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers#:~:text=NASA%20has%20chosen%20SpaceX%2C%20Blue,man%20to%20the%20lunar%20surface."&gt;a combined $967 million&lt;/a&gt; to develop lunar lander concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKkzK9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; first reported that SpaceX won the contract, before the NASA announcement. In an internal letter to NASA employees, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Human Lander Selection program manager Lisa Watson Morgan says she’s “very disappointed that information was leaked prior to the event today... I am sorry you had to find out about it that way as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFtZ8P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d3d46dc6-a830-4c10-9f25-fde9b7819c7f"&gt;NASA was expected to pick &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; companies&lt;/a&gt; to receive contracts for the first Moon landing mission since the Apollo program. So giving the contract to SpaceX &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; is a slap in the face to Blue Origin in particular — and its team, which included Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. In the commercial crew program, for instance, both Boeing and SpaceX received contracts. The redundancy gave NASA options in case one of the companies didn’t deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="crTLQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is important work for us ahead, just not at the funding levels we initially expected.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WusOqy"&gt;“There is important work for us ahead, just not at the funding levels we initially expected,” Morgan wrote in her email. With only one partner, the number of people who work on the program will also be reduced, she wrote. The agency chose to award only one partner in order to get the program running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h5Mhr"&gt;The SpaceX bid was Starship, the next-generation spacecraft the company is building in Boca Chica, Texas. It’s expected to be able to carry a crew of astronauts and 100 tons of cargo. Starship is supposed to use its main engines to lower itself to a hard surface, such as the Moon or Mars. SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311916/spacex-starship-prototype-landing-successful"&gt;successfully landed Starship once&lt;/a&gt; on March 3rd, though it blew up almost immediately afterward. Another landing attempt, on March 30th, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;ended in flames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="maVdw6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NASA has selected Starship to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program! We are humbled to help &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAArtemis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAArtemis&lt;/a&gt; usher in a new era of human space exploration → &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qcuop33Ryz"&gt;https://t.co/Qcuop33Ryz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GN9Tcfqlfp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GN9Tcfqlfp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SpaceX (@SpaceX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1383160370248896512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TMA0QD"&gt;“The human landing system is going to allow us to be able to access different parts of the lunar surface,” said Kathy Lauders, the associate administrator for NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, in a NASA livestream. “It also allows us to explore new technology and capabilities that will help us when we are trying to figure out our next round of technologies to be able to help us land on Mars or other planets out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brgYFu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375899/nasa-first-person-of-color-artemis-mission-moon-woman"&gt;The Artemis mission&lt;/a&gt; will land the first woman on the Moon, as well as the first person of color. (So far, only white men have walked on the lunar surface.) In November, the 18 astronauts who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;were part of the Artemis team were introduced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnE6Yr"&gt;President Joe Biden’s 2022 budget request includes $24.7 billion meant for NASA, and he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337787/biden-nasa-chief-choice-senator-bill-nelson"&gt;nominated former senator Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt; as NASA chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVGTuR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With reporting by Joey Roulette.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9l4VWR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:43PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds details on the program, and email from HLS program manager Lisa Watson Morgan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
