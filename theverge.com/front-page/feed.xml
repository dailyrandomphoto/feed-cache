    <title>Returnal finally adds a ‘suspend’ feature to let you pause the game mid-run</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k9anuu2ege6MeykB0C_ONKABv1o=/213x0:2685x1648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046392/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_8.23.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qmPFGQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/26/returnal-2-0-update-brings-suspend-cycle-and-photo-mode/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s 2.0 update is out today&lt;/a&gt;, bringing two of the most requested features for Housemarque’s punishingly difficult sci-fi roguelike: the option to suspend the game in the middle of a run without losing progress, and a photo mode for capturing all of Atropos’ most stunning visuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zYRVx"&gt;The lack of a suspend mode has been one of the biggest knocks against the otherwise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;well-received title&lt;/a&gt;. An average run in &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; can easily take upward of 45 minutes and had to be completed in a single gameplay session. Players were unable to close out &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and come back to a run later, and if the console was accidentally shut down or lost power, you’d lose all your hard-won progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ogpDJK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Returnal is dark, challenging, and the perfect PS5 showcase","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lzQJk2"&gt;The new “Suspend Cycle” mode aims to fix that. It’s not a traditional save mode — you won’t be able to save scum your way out of poorly made decisions or bad luck — but it will let players create a single suspension point, exit the game, and return to the moment they left. There are some limitations, too: you won’t be able to create a suspend point during boss fights, cinematics, any of &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s first-person sequences, or when players are deep in combat, but even with those caveats, its a much-needed addition to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7qXic"&gt;As Housemarque game director Harry Krueger explains, “With this approach, we can keep the roguelike spirit and ‘high stakes’ commitment to your run intact, while still providing some quality-of-life convenience for players who like to experience &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; in shorter bursts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pHLc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s new update also adds a photo mode, which will let players pause the game at any point, pan around the frozen environment, and snap a picture of the exact moment they want. &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s photo mode also offers more advanced options, the ability to adjust things like focal distance, aperture, saturation, and contrast of your shot, swapping out different light sources, and, of course, different filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gjt86L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://housemarque.com/news/2021/10/25/returnal-patch-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;’s 2.0 update&lt;/a&gt; is rolling out today for the PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is building a Clubhouse competitor that turns hosts into DJs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79SwqlLDmV_Tqt1cp1ywrIevDT0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046350/acastro_211024_1777_amazonMusic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.alexecastro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ybu15u"&gt;Amazon is next on the list of companies getting into the live audio game. The company is building a new app, codenamed “Project Mic,” that gives anyone the ability to make and distribute a live radio show, complete with music, according to a presentation viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This project’s big goal is to democratize and reinvent the radio. The app will be focused on the US initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnwYUU"&gt;Listeners will be able to tune in through the app, as well as through Audible, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Alexa-equipped devices. With the Alexa devices, listeners will be able to interact with shows using just their voice. The app experience will also be optimized for the car, playing into Amazon’s idea of trying to reinvent radio. A mockup app image viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; depicts a screen listing shows that are currently live; trending topics, like #NBA or #hot100; and featured creators. Users will also be able to search for content by topic, name, or music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80lc1T"&gt;Anyone will be able to pull from Amazon’s music catalog to arrange their program. For launch, the company is planning to recruit celebrity talent along with smaller tastemakers to help launch the app and populate it with content. Although the app is highly music-focused, programming will center on three other areas: pop culture, comedy, and sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqpIQp"&gt;Amazon did not respond to a request for comment for this story. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-live-audio-clubhouse-competitor-ea0ead59-f6d3-49a0-a216-a4105e0338ba.html"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s work to create some sort of live audio feature and noted that the company was working with record labels to coordinate live events with artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZGlT4"&gt;With this app, Amazon joins the likes of Apple, Spotify, and even Sonos, which are looking to program radio-adjacent content. All these companies work with music curators to host shows and try to replicate the radio experience digitally. In Amazon’s case, it might see the benefit of this app as something that can be localized — shows can be catered to where a person lives and they could even receive ads based on that location, too. Plus, with interaction being able to happen through Echo devices, the call-in experience can also be replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVldI"&gt;Clubhouse popularized the idea of live audio, but it has yet to find a way to allow people to play music from major artists on the app. It also is more focused on being a social network than a place to get all someone’s audio needs met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wkXtR"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify in particular seems interested in dominating the car and replicating the typical radio use case. The company releases a daily morning show that combines personalized music recommendations with a talk show, called &lt;em&gt;The Get Up&lt;/em&gt;, and earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726497/spotify-car-thing-hardware-waitlist"&gt;started a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; to sell its Bluetooth-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads"&gt;Car Thing&lt;/a&gt; more widely. Amazon also sells a Bluetooth, Alexa-equipped device for the car, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt;, but notably hasn’t introduced a new version since launch. It also works with car manufacturers to ship vehicles with its Alexa assistant installed, which might help this new app and its programming reach listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH1q8N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s broadband satellite venture Kuiper teams up with Verizon to expand 5G coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI9_f7W1gIiuszqwr1G_yVa-y50=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046195/51595784865_fc7b54d339_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Atlas V launching at night. Project Kuiper has bought nine launches of Atlas V rockets to send its satellites into orbit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: United Launch Alliance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdhCxK"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite venture, called Kuiper, is teaming up with Verizon to further expand 4G/LTE and 5G coverage to remote areas of the globe. Through the new partnership, Kuiper’s future satellites could provide connectivity to future Verizon cell towers that don’t require as much costly infrastructure to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxU7e"&gt;Kuiper is Amazon’s $10 billion initiative to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet coverage to the Earth below. With satellites flying at altitudes between 366 miles and 391 miles high (or 590 kilometers and 630 kilometers up), the plan is to provide connectivity to remote and rural areas, where it is difficult to provide internet coverage through traditional fiber. During prototype testing, Kuiper claims its system can produce throughput speeds of up to 400 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVJcKL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“no single company will close the digital divide on its own.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D700Wm"&gt;Amazon is partnering with Verizon to use Kuiper for satellite-based cellular backhaul, allowing (in theory) for Verizon to expand access to its 4G and 5G networks to more rural and remote locations without having to lay cables for more traditional connectivity methods. Instead, Verizon would be able to build 4G and 5G towers in rural and hard-to-reach areas without digging trenches to lay fiber cables — something that is both difficult and sometimes cost-prohibitive. By removing the need to lay fiber and cable in these remote areas, the deal could expand Verizon’s reach in areas that suffer from low cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76rA4F"&gt;“There are billions of people without reliable broadband access, and no single company will close the digital divide on its own,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said in a statement. “Verizon is a leader in wireless technology and infrastructure, and we’re proud to be working together to explore bringing fast, reliable broadband to the customers and communities who need it most.” Kuiper declined to say how much Verizon is paying for this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvmbv"&gt;Such a reality is still quite a ways off, though. Amazon’s Kuiper has yet to launch any satellites. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;As part of its launch license with the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Kuiper must launch at least half of all of its satellites, or 1,618 spacecraft, by 2026. In April, Kuiper announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;purchased nine launches of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; to send its first batch of satellites to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khOguD"&gt;Kuiper’s a proposed competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink project, which aims to provide the same kind of coverage, except with roughly 12,000 satellites instead. So far, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 Starlink satellites into orbit around Earth and has even allowed users to test out individual connectivity through a beta program. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that Starlink would phase out of beta in October, but there has not been an official update on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4TIEH"&gt;Both Starlink and Kuiper rely on individual customers buying personal dish antennas, in order to get connectivity from the satellites orbiting above them. Last year, Kuiper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;revealed the design of its 12-inch-wide dish&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly half the size of Starlink’s dish (though SpaceX recently &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/new-starlink-user-dish-with-smaller-antenna-pops-up-in-fcc-filing/"&gt;requested a new license&lt;/a&gt; from the FCC for a smaller next-generation antenna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FAEks"&gt;Starlink and Kuiper aren’t the only companies hoping to provide broadband internet access with low-flying satellites. Another company &lt;a href="https://oneweb.net/media-center/oneweb-confirms-successful-launch-of-36-satellites-from-vostochny"&gt;OneWeb has already launched 358 satellites&lt;/a&gt; of a proposed 648-satellite constellation. Meanwhile, another smaller company, Telesat, also plans to launch a constellation of nearly 300 satellites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBrAQU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Palm’s brand resuscitated again for true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uPtsocPVmEGaYCcQn_pWOnqQGYA=/0x203:2000x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70046194/ECF37DFD_319C_4CF8_8A54_1C143299ED8D.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Palm Ventures Group, Inc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeXGm1"&gt;After launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18212311/palm-phone-review-time-well-spent-life-mode-lite-verizon"&gt;Palm Phone in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the reincarnated “Palm” is back again with its next new product. But it’s not another smartphone. Instead, the startup that now owns the Palm brand is jumping on the trend of true wireless earbuds. The Palm Buds Pro — yes, yet another “Pro” gadget — are available to preorder starting today for $99, though they’ll eventually rise to an MSRP of $129. For that price, you’ll be getting a set of earbuds with noise cancellation, bass-heavy 10-millimeter drivers, and IPX4 water and sweat resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1tKzs"&gt;Palm says the earbuds fit into its “lightweight product philosophy” that began with the tiny, TCL-manufactured Palm Phone, which is no longer available. As for who’s making the Palm Buds Pro, Palm Ventures Group says “Palm manufactures the Palm Buds Pro with support from suppliers based out of China.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8PWVYgsw8aZ92PSD-rc_mBwtEQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22955315/C9236C1F_4507_4EDF_B122_85BB92491739.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Palm Ventures Group, Inc&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5zYr6P"&gt;With a quick 30-second perusal of Amazon, I found &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Transparent-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Earphones/dp/B098NRRPR1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these earbuds with an identical design&lt;/a&gt; (minus the logo). It seems to be a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fenacfire.com%2Fproducts%2Fenacfire-a9-wireless-earbuds&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22745711%2Fpalm-buds-pro-announced-pricing-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fairly common OEM reference design&lt;/a&gt;, though Palm’s buds apparently have more microphones — three on each earbud — than those products. “Our engineers have developed one of the most advanced active noise canceling (ANC) and environmental noise cancelling (ENC) systems on the market,” Palm Ventures Group said in an FAQ on the product. The company says its leadership includes “the designers of Beats by Dre and Samsung’s most popular headphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwx0zf"&gt;Palm Ventures claims the Palm Buds Pro deliver “studio grade audio” at their rather aggressive price point. Battery life is rated at up to four and a half hours when active noise cancellation is enabled; switching it off can extend that to 5.5 hours. Including case recharges, you can expect “over 24 hours” of total playback. The Palm Buds Pro have noise cancellation and transparency modes, and as I mentioned above, their six-mic architecture also has environmental noise cancellation to help people on the other side of a call hear you better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXFiW9"&gt;The Palm Buds Pro will start shipping in early November. They only come in black, but Palm Ventures Group will also be selling silicone cases (with carabiners) if you’d prefer more color. They’re up for order on &lt;a href="http://Palm.com"&gt;Palm.com&lt;/a&gt; now and will be available through Amazon on November 9th — but at that point they’ll cost the higher $129. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQoNs7"&gt;I haven’t heard the Palm Buds Pro firsthand yet, so I can’t say how they compare to their very similar-looking Amazon competitors or other options like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;the Nothing earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which also cost $99. But these things couldn’t feel much more detached from the Palm of old. The Palm Phone at least had some unique qualities to it, even if it wasn’t the first tiny phone meant to keep you from using your big phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvemrF"&gt;Speaking of the old Palm, have you watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;our new documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;? It’s available now on The Verge app for Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku (with Apple TV coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch streaming is returning to the Xbox dashboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpAKfmxL6Pdg1slK5iHSiaJ7yk8=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045961/twitchxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFWdFf"&gt;Microsoft is bringing back Twitch streaming integration directly into the Xbox dashboard. Twitch first appeared directly integrated into the Xbox One dashboard in 2014, using the original Snap interface to allow players to stream directly to the service. Now it’s coming back into the Xbox Guide interface, with similar integration and webcam support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ZS4F"&gt;Alpha and Skip-Ahead alpha Xbox testers &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/25/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211022-2000/"&gt;can access the new integration&lt;/a&gt; right now, and it’s simple to use. You can adjust game volume or microphone volume, include party audio from friends, and see a list of viewers and how long you’ve been streaming with an overlay on top of your games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdvqTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaRNtcaVSRQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vUbjR0"&gt;The Twitch integration also includes the ability to switch resolution and bitrates from 360p at 500kbps up to 1080p at 6500kbps. Microsoft is also supporting USB webcams, and most plug-and-play ones should work as a camera option for Twitch streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlGSu0"&gt;Twitch has had Xbox streaming support inside its own app, but integration into the dashboard is a welcome return after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384132/microsoft-xbox-one-snap-mode-feature-removed"&gt;removed its Snap feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/894253OJn0w"&gt;Twitch integration&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. We’re expecting this new Twitch integration to be broadly released in the coming months, once Microsoft has fully tested it with Xbox testers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFMkgo"&gt;Sony is ready to throw-down with a new camera-first 5G phone — the Xperia Pro-I — in the battle for smartphone camera supremacy. Less than 12-hours after the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s reviews started dropping online, and all the camera enthusiasts trying to determine whether the Pixel 6 Pro or the iPhone 13 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera, Sony wants to be in the mix with the Xperia Pro-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk3hDL"&gt;The “I” in the Xperia Pro-I stands for imaging, which pays homage to Sony’s popular line of Alpha mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras and professional video cameras, rather than point-and-shoot camera model names like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII (Mark 7)&lt;/a&gt;. At least that’s what the Sony representatives who were briefing journalists ahead of this event told us. The star of the show is obviously this device’s camera technology, so it’s totally fair to think of the Xperia Pro-I as a camera that happens to come with a phone attached. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdm2oODa5ywRnuN5kYNCOXv_OA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956098/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_03_bf3834489e39e3e3a97099d54615d806.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s triple rear camera array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMGXWd"&gt;After all, it’s notable for using a similar 1.0-type Exmor RS image sensor with phase detection AF (autofocus) that powers the RX100 VII, the preferred point-and-shooter of vloggers and tourists. This large 1-inch camera sensor enables “outstanding low light performance, high dynamic range, and beautiful bokeh,” according to Sony. However, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPReview&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that while this 1-inch sensor is 20 megapixels in total, the Xperia Pro-I only makes use of part of the sensor, meaning it outputs a 12-megapixel image on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nWc1Y"&gt;While rare, Sony isn’t the first to include a 1-inch sensor in a phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp’s Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; had one when it was announced earlier this year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Panasonic’s CM1 from 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSN6M"&gt;Sony’s Xperia Pro-I has a total of three 12-megapixel cameras on the back (a main, ultrawide, and telephoto) and one 8-megapixel camera around its front. While these cameras seem low-resolution, the Sony representative was very eager to explain that they contain fewer but larger (2.4µm) pixels, where each pixel captures more details, more dynamic range and greater depth of field. The company seems confident it doesn’t need to chase higher megapixel counts like its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTrH0u"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s rear cameras use three glass lenses from Zeiss. Its main 24mm lens has dual aperture (f2.0/f4.4) that allows you to change the depth of field more quickly to create “authentic bokeh,” rather than the digital software-created bokeh effect that other phones produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8CVaZDvtYb372NgLNAF0sld_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956097/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s display has a 21:9 aspect ratio, making this a narrow, tall device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coBHFC"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I includes the same BIONZ X imaging processor found in Sony’s A9 professional mirrorless camera for sports, which allows it to take up to 20fps in burst shots similar to Sony’s recent smartphones like the Xperia 1 III. This is the rare smartphone camera that is fast at autofocus, and capable of real-time eye tracking (humans and animals) in both stills and videos. Speaking of videos, Sony claims that the Xperia Pro-I is is the first smartphone in the world that can record 4K videos at 120fps and be able to preserve all 120 frames. While other smartphones can record 4K videos, they often compress the frames into a smaller file, which means you won’t have as much control in post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZsaSi"&gt;On the phone side of the Xperia Pro-I, it has a 6.5-inch 21:9 3840x1644 OLED display, with 120Hz refresh rate, at a relatively skinny 21:9 aspect ratio. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor, and unlocked models should work on most 4G networks in the world, as well as sub-6GHz 5G. There’s 12GB RAM, 512GB of internal storage, a microSDXC card slot, and a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 30W. Despite its premium and modern specs, the Xperia Pro-I still has a 3.5mm audio jack for creators who need to plug in a mic, and a strap hole to slide in a wrist strap for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxwYGX"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I will ship in December 2021 for a whopping $1,800 (£1,599). That’s the same price as Samsung’s flagship foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;, and $200 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673600/iphone-13-1-tera-storage-memory-price-apple"&gt;1TB model of Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $1,599. It’s also more than a Sony’s $1,300 RX 100 VII, and the same price as the $1,800 full-frame Sony A7C. But Sony’s aim with the Xperia Pro-I is to provide a device that can do it all, combining the quality of a dedicated point-and-shoot camera with a thin (0.35-inch) 5G phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpuHTb"&gt;Preorders for the Sony Xperia Pro-I will begin October 28, 2021 at 10:00AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q320W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s value tops $1 trillion after Hertz ordered 100,000 of its vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Car Maker Tesla Reports Record Quarterly Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cy6FSu1ENwRKL0_MYxbqRI0CzxM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041271/1347936771.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcJ6yp"&gt;Rental car company Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. A first tranche of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent from Hertz in major US and European markets from early November, said the company in a &lt;a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement comes just months after Hertz &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html"&gt;escaped bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77ESnD"&gt;After the purchase was announced, Tesla’s stock price reached as high as $998.74 early in the day, increasing its market cap to over $1 trillion before the price dropped again. However, by the time the market closed for the day, its price had risen again, finishing at $1,024.86 per share for a market cap of $1.01 trillion. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/tesla-shares-up-on-news-hertz-will-purchase-100000-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; notes, that put it in the rare company of other trillion-dollar market cap companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. At &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpQ0hC"&gt;News of the purchase was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-orders-100-000-teslas-tsla-stock-soars?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which says the deal is the single largest order ever for electric vehicles, and worth $4.2 billion in revenue to Tesla. The automaker’s stock was &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-surges-toward-a-record-after-hertz-reportedly-ordered-100000-tesla-evs-2021-10-25"&gt;up 4.3 percent on the news&lt;/a&gt; in pre-market trading. It was also reported this morning that Tesla’s Model 3 became the first electric vehicle to top &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;monthly sales charts&lt;/a&gt; in Europe this September. Earlier this month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;reported record sales&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, despite chip shortages denting the automotive market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="prErM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s been a very good month for Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fGrhC"&gt;Anyone renting a Tesla from Hertz will be able to use the automaker’s network of 3,000 superchargers across the US and Europe. Hertz says it’s planing on supplementing these chargers with “thousands” of its own, dispersed “throughout its location network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YbtfM"&gt;Hertz went into bankruptcy in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy-coronavirus-car-rental.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;May last year&lt;/a&gt; after the car rental market was hit hard by the pandemic. The company, which is more than a hundred years old, was eventually re-financed to the tune of $5.9 billion by investors led by Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Hertz now plans to electrify nearly all of its roughly 500,000 cars and vans, with the Tesla order comprising a significant first chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erfKHV"&gt;In a press statement, Hertz’s interim CEO Mark Fields said: “Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we’ve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest. The new Hertz is going to lead the way as a mobility company, starting with the largest EV rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our EV fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpi4nh"&gt;To publicize the move, Hertz has launched a new ad campaign featuring Tom Brady. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9IcNMg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Facebook hires Britney Spears’ lawyer to fight an upcoming TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMNV0UAVwiRE5rj0ncfaYp18iGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044546/VRG_ILLO_4033_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uGxTnz"&gt;Facebook probably wishes it had a delete button for its timeline now that it’s threatening an upcoming TV show with a lawsuit for potentially tarnishing the brand’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHIdMX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/em&gt; is the upcoming television adaption of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22577939/facebook-an-ugly-truth-frankel-kang-stamos-russia-interference"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that exposes Facebook’s missteps on issues like misinformation, hate speech, user security. The drama will star Claire Foy as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and will tackle the chaos surrounding misinformation during the 2016 election, as well as more recent controversies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;like the XCheck program&lt;/a&gt;, which let celebrities and other high-profile figures bypass content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAIEiu"&gt;As the series begins to come together, Facebook is threatening producers Anonymous Content with a lawsuit — and it’s using Britney Spears’ lawyers to do so (via &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-legal-letter-tv-adaptation-claire-foy-anonymous-content-1234861789/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/mathew-rosengart-rosengod/"&gt;Mathew Rosengart, the same lawyer who helped free Spears&lt;/a&gt; from her conservatorship, sent a letter to Anonymous Content CEO Dawn Olmstead, detailing the legal action Facebook might take if any false statements or exaggerations about the company appear in the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNdZZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook will take all appropriate legal action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H4mBgE"&gt;As stated in the letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, Rosengart says that “the First Amendment does not protect knowingly false statements or portrayals — or those made with reckless disregard for the truth — even about public figures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nckOTF"&gt;He then goes on to attack the accuracy of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, noting that it’s “replete with false and defamatory statements, characterizations, and implications about Facebook and its leadership.” If Anonymous Content decides to put any of these so-called falsities in its television adaption, Rosengart says that “Facebook will take all appropriate legal action.” To our knowledge, Facebook hasn’t taken legal action against the authors or publisher of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odbNFa"&gt;Rosengart even mentioned that Facebook is willing to work with Anonymous Content to ensure that the series is “accurate and truthful.” As for whether Anonymous Content will consider getting Facebook’s input, that’s still up in the air. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Anonymous Content for a statement and hasn’t heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfebyp"&gt;Facebook is probably just blowing smoke, but there’s no way to tell until the series debuts and Facebook finds something it doesn’t like. This may be one of the only times that Facebook is actively trying to squeeze into the plaintiff’s chair, considering Facebook’s long track record of being on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736476/mark-zuckerberg-dc-attorney-general-facebook-cambridge-analytica-lawsuit"&gt;opposite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114358/facebook-550-million-settle-lawsuit-facial-recognition-technology-illinois"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144291/facebook-irs-lawsuit-9-billion-taxes"&gt;of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why smart alarm clocks can’t be trusted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57HNvUXsSUQ9v36-0_oTiB9mSA0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044517/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart alarm clocks like this Echo Dot with Clock have lots of great features, but are missing one key feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ba4CM5"&gt;When you buy a product labeled “smart,” it should be better than the “dumb” version, especially considering it costs twice as much (at least). But that’s not the case with smart alarm clocks, which are very dumb in one specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBNCYI"&gt;Smart alarm clocks are bedside buzzers with smart features, letting you set an alarm with just your voice, waking you up with your favorite Spotify playlist, possibly tracking your sleep, and definitely controlling your smart home. Most have touch screens, some have radar, very few have cameras (thankfully), and others can use lighting to wake you up more naturally than a jarring buzzer. But what none of them have is a backup battery, something that’s been standard on the dumb versions for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhIMz4"&gt;If your power goes out in the middle of the night and doesn’t come back on in time, you could stay in dreamland indefinitely. Why do smart alarm clocks not have this blindingly obvious feature? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRdoHI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot with a Clock&lt;/a&gt; smart speaker is clearly designed for your nightstand — the app has over 20 different alarm tones to choose from. But does it come with a battery backup? Nope. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2&lt;/a&gt; has a nightlight, touchscreen, even a dock for wirelessly charging your phone, but no little lithium-ion battery to make sure you wake up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; with sleep tracking is smart enough to watch you while you’re sleeping using Soli radar tech. But it’s not going to wake you up if your power goes out overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_dpEJcpDaF-qagPdJyvRt_Te4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16389067/dseifert_190620_3500_5237.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Smart Clock and the Echo Show 5 are two touchscreen smart alarm clocks that offer a myriad of smart features, but can’t be guaranteed to wake you up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0CK5If"&gt;Missing an alarm is not a huge issue for a lot of people, but for some, it’s a big problem. Take my husband for an example. He’s a fire captain / paramedic, so rolling up late to work not only raises the possibility of being fired, but it means his counterpart who was up all night dealing with a five-car pileup has to work an extra hour or two on top of his 24-hour shift. This is one of the many reasons he refuses to rely on one. He loves the features smart alarm clocks offer (especially the sleep tracking on the Google Nest Hub), but he always has his smartphone plugged in by his bed to actually wake him up. Because it, unlike any smart alarm clock, has a battery that can last well into the morning if that plug fails him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWSSdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What none of them have is a backup battery, something that’s been standard on the dumb versions for decades &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRgWV"&gt;There are a couple alarm clocks out there with smart features that manage to find room for a coin cell battery or a couple AAs to keep your settings intact if the power goes out, but it’s doubtful they’ll have the juice to sound your alarm as well. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iHome-Bluetooth-Assistant-Charging-Chargers/dp/B07ZWCV1L1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This iHome alarm clock&lt;/a&gt; does and even works with Siri and Google Assistant (if you push a button). The&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyloftie.com%2F%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokogsRx4QFQlI9j4mz-wl9_3BfgZmr2L-8ziCfdhoiXqCLmAaJP6K9RoChiwQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22727055%2Falexa-google-smart-speaker-alarm-clocks-backup-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; $150 Loftie&lt;/a&gt;, which offers sound baths and guided meditation, also throws in a backup option. But when it comes to what I consider a real smart alarm clock, with useful features like a touchscreen, built-in voice assistants, smart home controls, and Wi-Fi connectivity, you’re out of luck if you want to be 100 percent sure you’re going to wake up on time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJdNJzPSzjVxgF_YU2Aluv4GtM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399112/dseifert_20210323_4485_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sleep tracking on the Google Nest hub is powered by radar technology -- but if the power goes out it’s not going to wake you up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zWjqgZ"&gt;It seems manufacturers are so concerned with stuffing every feature possible into their smart bedside displays that they’ve neglected to focus on the product’s original core function. That’s a running theme with many smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb6PW6"&gt;Smart alarm clocks can send you to sleep with soothing sounds of the rainforest while dimming the lights in your room, locking your doors, and adjusting your thermostat. Then they can wake you up with your favorite songs while telling your lights to gradually brighten to trick your circadian rhythm into getting its ass in gear. They can even turn on your thermostat to keep you from catching a chill when you get out of the shower. Some can also charge your phone and watch at the same time! But will any of them go off if the power is out? Nope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LDw1lJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why can’t smart alarm clocks be smart enough to do their primary job reliably?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJsL6"&gt;It doesn’t seem like that oversight is a technical limitation: Philips’ artificial sunlight alarm clock includes an 8-hour backup in case of power failures, though it’s a stretch to call it “smart.” And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"&gt;Facebook’s new Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; is a smart display with a giant lithium-ion battery inside. While it’s not designed to be used as a bedside clock (it’s huge, has a camera in it, and is really for calling your family on Facebook — not something you often do from bed), it does prove it’s entirely possible for a smart display to have two reliable power sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0YgRA"&gt;Yes, the likelihood of being affected by a power outage is slim — the idea that your clock will be dead at the exact moment you are supposed to wake up. And, because they’re smart enough to reset when the power comes back on, you aren’t going to wake up to the terror-inducing red LEDs blinking “12:00” at you. But the fact remains: there’s a possibility they won’t work. And that’s discomforting enough for someone like my husband. He refuses to rely on a smart alarm clock until it can do its job properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ASZw2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVIt6G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s refocusing company on ‘serving young adults’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="meI0dy"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s redirected teams within his company to “make serving young adults their north star.” The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;Facebooks’ concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1RV0K"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clYbeu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok is “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LuX6K8"&gt;He suggested the change will be more than just lip service. Facebook usage among older users will grow slower than it otherwise would have because of the changes, Zuckerberg said. Even with those tradeoffs, he said, “I think it’s the right approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FszsiV"&gt;Zuckerberg expects the changes to take years. One of the more immediate shifts could be to Instagram, which he says will see “significant changes” to lean further into video and make Reels “a more central part of the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruWVB6"&gt;The shift toward video is very clearly a response to TikTok, which Zuckerberg called “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f7RKR"&gt;While the details are largely talk for now, it’s clear that Facebook has been thinking and planning this before now. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported today on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;leaked Facebook documents showing the company’s alarm&lt;/a&gt; at seeing declining usage, with a precipitous drop predicted in the years ahead. The documents also show ideas Facebook considered to increase usage among younger users, including revamped groups, job finding tools, and “mood feeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
