    <title>Gloomhaven and other popular tabletop games are on Amazon’s Deal of the Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_nJtG9igkBphOunlm5cM-Zs3bRw=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950797/gloomhaven_3_2048x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven is like a ready-to-play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign in a box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cephalofair Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CvhCV9"&gt;Amazon has billed today’s Deal of the Day as its “Epic Daily Deal,” and the shoe certainly fits when it includes one of the most epic RPG-in-a-box titles of all time. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZXVN4P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/em&gt; is currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;, tying its all-time low price of $85 just for today. This shaves 40 percent off its usual MSRP of $140. If you have ever considered playing &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; but could never get one of your friends to buckle down and put in the work as gamemaster, &lt;em&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/em&gt; might be the perfect solution for you and up to three friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UowpcB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQRFyn"&gt;The cardboard gaming deals don’t end there, with plenty of lighter and easily approachable titles also on sale. If you’re partial to simple games that use cards and dice and can be learned and played in less than an hour, consider &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragonwood-Game-Dice-Daring-Board/dp/B00UB7OV7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragonwood&lt;/em&gt; for only $10&lt;/a&gt;. Are you a murder mystery fan? You can pick between two &lt;em&gt;Cold Case &lt;/em&gt;games by ThinkFun to solve, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThinkFun-Cold-Case-Murder-Mystery/dp/B0937P214V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Story to Die For&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ThinkFun-Cold-Case-Murder-Mystery/dp/B0937P8DBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pinch of Murder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — each just $10. Prefer something totally unique? Grow trees in the beautifully designed game of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Orange-Games-Photosynthesis-Strategy/dp/B074K5W5N5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photosynthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $23. Want to play co-operatively with friends and family in a fantastical game of exploration and survival against the elements? Gamewright’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-317-Forbidden-Island-Card/dp/B003D7F4YY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbidden Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-415-Forbidden-Desert-Board/dp/B00B4ECHJI?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbidden Desert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are amazing introductions to getting newer players into designer board games, and they’re only $14 and $17, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZizj1"&gt;If some of those titles are relative unknowns to you, this one might need no introduction. &lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; helped create the era of modern tabletop and board games we currently live in. It has been an institution of the gaming world since it was released in 1995 and has maintained popularity and influence throughout the years. There are many expansions and spin-offs, as well as myriad games taking inspiration from it. The base game of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studios-cantan2017/dp/B00U26V4VQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; is currently on sale at Amazon for just $30&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studio-CN3222-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B08CD3QS55?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;25th Anniversary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is $52&lt;/a&gt;, and some further expansions range from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Studios-CN3072-Extension-Player/dp/B00U26V9CU?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$16&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Catan-Cities-Knights-Conquerors-Scenario/dp/B084HNCLRV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FpFL4X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10619476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7MRJzH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789660"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fh6Zn2"&gt;There are so many great games to choose from, with enough variety in genres that should satisfy classic and modern board game fans alike. Here are a few more highlight titles we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is BGP, and how might it have helped kick Facebook off the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUX_U2aTbKaCicm0z-2jikMkx6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950766/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06o5Y9"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Facebook was completely knocked offline&lt;/a&gt;, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"&gt;a few other websites&lt;/a&gt;) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is on its way back up, but this all begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there’s a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP’s job is to show them the way and make sure it’s the best route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBANNl"&gt;I’ve heard BGP described as a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;system of post offices&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjkU7Hw2TY4"&gt;air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt;, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dsS9q9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGE7t8"&gt;When it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they’re networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what’s responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVV2vk"&gt;Since the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don’t want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it’d be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They’ll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they’ve made to their maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QFYfuw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turn left into the river&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwhMP"&gt;Using maps as a framework, it’s easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it’s not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn’t caught, that mistake will end up on everyone’s map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we’ll get to those in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt174N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn2Yhp"&gt;Of course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can’t talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that’s the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1vLb7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHByP"&gt;Right! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn’t always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;cost can be a factor as well&lt;/a&gt;, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1M9KLB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKHu1I"&gt;Also, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to &lt;a href="https://palousetocascadestrail.org/maps.html"&gt;plan a trip&lt;/a&gt; where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it’s that hard to pin down for a “town” that has all of five roads, imagine what it’s like &lt;em&gt;trying to connect the entire internet together&lt;/em&gt;. Real roads don’t change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1hup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUWdq"&gt;I’ll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqmwFa"&gt;But Facebook didn’t! In fact, it’s built its own BGP system, which lets it do “fast incremental updates,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-abhashkumar.pdf"&gt;a paper presented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the system the company describes there is meant for communication &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; data centers — at this point, it’s hard to say what caused Facebook’s problems on Monday, and it’d take someone smarter than me to say whether Facebook’s datacenter communications could cause this kind of issue. Cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;Bryan Krebs claims&lt;/a&gt; that the outage was caused by a “routine BGP update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wo7RY5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHfYUbKNEyc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xoON2I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does DNS have to do with all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGuWsc"&gt;To borrow &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/"&gt;an explanation from Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: DNS tells you where you’re going, and BGP tells you how to get there. DNS is how computers know what IP address a website or other resource can be found at, but that knowledge itself isn’t helpful — if you ask your friend where their house is, you’re still probably going to need GPS to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1Pfe6"&gt;Cloudflare also has a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;great technical rundown&lt;/a&gt; of how BGP errors can also mess up DNS requests — the article is specifically about Monday’s Facebook incident, so it’s worth a read if you’re looking for an explanation of what it looked like from an autonomous system’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5gSi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can go wrong with BGP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulglag"&gt;Many things. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;According to Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, two notable incidents include a Turkish ISP accidentally telling the entire internet to route its traffic to its service in 2004 and a Pakistani ISP accidentally banning YouTube worldwide after trying to do so only for its users. Because of BGP’s ability to spread from autonomous system to autonomous system (which, as a reminder, is one of the things that makes it so darn useful), one group making a mistake can cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="opwgjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is sometimes called the duct tape of the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAmSlc"&gt;One group getting owned can also cause problems — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275982/myetherwallet-hack-bgp-dns-hijacking-stolen-ethereum"&gt;hackers were able to hijack requests to Amazon’s DNS&lt;/a&gt; and steal thousands of dollars in Ethereum by compromising a separate ISP’s BGP servers. Amazon wasn’t the one hacked, but traffic meant for it ended up somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUS9AS"&gt;Or, you can mess it up and delete your entire service off the internet with a bad BGP update. BGP is lovingly called the duct tape of the internet, but no adhesive is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nLdTL"&gt;So what happened to Facebook?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FZM7pm"&gt;It seems like Facebook’s servers, for some reason, told everyone to take them off their maps. We’ll likely have to wait for a report from Facebook if we want to know exactly what happened to its BGP configuration and why that change was made. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176"&gt;Cloudflare’s CTO&lt;/a&gt; reports that the service saw a ton of BGP updates from Facebook (most of which were route withdrawals, or erasing lines on the map leading to Facebook) right before it went dark. One of Fastly’s tech leads tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryan505/status/1445072241256013828"&gt;Facebook stopped providing routes to Fastly&lt;/a&gt; when it went offline, and &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/"&gt;backs up the idea&lt;/a&gt; that it was some update to Facebook’s BGP that knocked out its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksYqld"&gt;I’d recommend &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;Cloudflare's explanation&lt;/a&gt; if you want nitty-gritty technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx49q6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If BGP was the problem, how does Facebook fix it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReG75S"&gt;Given that the outage went on for hours, the answer seems to be “not easily.” Facebook needed to make sure that it was advertising the correct records and that those records were picked up by the internet at large. In other words, it needed to make sure its maps were right and that everyone could see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccYKNf"&gt;That’s easier said than done, though. There were reports of Facebook employees &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057"&gt;being locked out from badge-protected doors&lt;/a&gt; and of employees struggling to communicate. In situations like these, you not only have to figure out who has the knowledge to solve the problem, and who has the permissions to solve the problem, but how to connect those people. And when your entire company is dead in the water, that’s no easy task — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;received reports&lt;/a&gt; of engineers being physically sent to a Facebook data center in California to try to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dEvABc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Locked out and totally down: Facebook is scrambling to fix massive outage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETZccb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would Web3 solve this problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKifo"&gt;Stop it. I will cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JHHM"&gt;But to quickly answer the question, probably not — even if Facebook hopped on the decentralized train, there’d still have to be some protocol telling you where to find its resources. We’ve seen that it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/"&gt;misconfigure or mess up blockchain contracts&lt;/a&gt; before, so I’d be a bit suspicious of anyone who said that a contract and blockchain-based internet would be immune to this kind of issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sIC21"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure was fishy timing on that outage given all the bad Facebook news, huh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjEq4n"&gt;Right, so obviously, the fact that this all happened while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;a whistleblower was going on TV and airing out Facebook’s dirty laundry&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to come up with alternative explanations. But it’s just as possible that this is an innocent mistake that some (very, very unfortunate) person on Facebook’s IT staff made. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is coming back after a six-hour outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bO6n6A12PstmdlZ_bKNj5QNRsfE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950524/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KZnXEX"&gt;Facebook is back online after a six-hour outage due to DNS routing problems. The outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;took down Instagram, Whatsapp, Messenger, and Oculus VR as well&lt;/a&gt;. For some, those services are back online now; however, after a DNS issue like this, it could take hours for everything to work properly on every network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMf0Bi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook: “We appreciate your patience as we come back online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="egDXnz"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET on Monday. It was the most significant outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. Journalist Brian Krebs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;cites a trusted source&lt;/a&gt; who told him the incident didn’t have any malicious origins. Instead, they said it started with a routine BGP update that went wrong, wiping out the DNS routing information that Facebook needs so that other networks can find its sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKbjdv"&gt;However, the problem meant remote users could access the network to use it, and the people on site didn’t have the network access necessary to repair things. This mirrors an anonymous account of the issue posted earlier to Reddit (and quickly deleted), which cited pandemic protocols as a reason fewer people were on location than usual, slowing restoration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne says to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement, “To everyone who was affected by the outages on our platforms today: we’re sorry. We know billions of people and businesses around the world depend on our products and services to stay connected. We appreciate your patience as we come back online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8vO2I"&gt;Inside Facebook, the outage broke internal systems as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;leaving employees unable to get into offices and communicate easily with each other&lt;/a&gt;. Some told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were using work-provided Outlook email accounts, allowing Facebook workers to email each other but unable to send or receive emails from external addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N6W6xQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Facebook services coming back online now - may take some time to get to 100%.  To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry.&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445158381845729282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Locked out and totally down: Facebook’s scramble to fix a massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K7m-20zYszke0f6MiKESYTZYClI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950350/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo6zhu"&gt;A prolonged, global outage of Facebook’s apps sent the company’s engineers scrambling to fix the issue at one of its data centers in California, according to two people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrorXh"&gt;The outage, which began around 11:40AM ET on Monday, brought down all of Facebook’s apps — including Instagram and WhatsApp — globally, affecting billions of users and millions of advertisers. Inside Facebook, the outage also broke nearly all of the internal systems that employees use to communicate and work. As of 6PM ET, it appears that most of the services are back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8vO2I"&gt;Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts since Facebook mainly runs on an internal version of the social network that is currently not accessible. While employees could email each other, they can’t send or receive emails from external addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifKzix"&gt;Since Facebook requires employees to log in with their work accounts to access tools such as Google Docs and Zoom, those services also weren’t working, leading some employees to use alternative services like Apple’s FaceTime and Discord. Employees who were already authenticated with non-Facebook tools like Google Docs before the outage began still had access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNRypQ"&gt;Facebook has yet to detail the cause of the outage internally or externally, though outside experts are saying it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;relates to the company’s networking architecture&lt;/a&gt; suddenly going offline. Facebook engineers were sent to one of its main US data centers in California to try and fix the problem, meaning the fix couldn’t be done remotely. “We understand how disruptive this is to everyone,” CTO Mike Schroepfer said in an email to employees that was seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqF6qF"&gt;Further complicating matters, the outage broke the ability for some employees to access company buildings and conference rooms with their badges, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-down.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported that engineers were being dispatched to the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diBOxl"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson pointed to a tweet by Schroepfer saying the company was experiencing “networking issues” and that employees “are working as fast as possible to debug and restore” its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IezK1N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4B9425"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:33PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that the outage is ending as Facebook and its other services are coming back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin has a new demo, and it’s awesome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJ0tgZ6YgXzko2zHyZQG6xpLu1o=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950702/02_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvjZUG"&gt;Square Enix released&lt;em&gt; Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://square-enix-games.com/sopffo/en-us/#trialversion"&gt;second demo&lt;/a&gt;, showing off a little bit more of what we can expect from the action-oriented &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff. The demo gets... interesting. In one cutscene, Jack, the main character, peaced out after a boss fight in hilarious fashion. Players shared the cutscene all over social media with an air of alarmed confusion, but I am here to state for the record that if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; is going to be like that moment, this game is going to kick so much ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hazmmF"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, fans were a bit surprised since the game is being developed by Team Ninja of &lt;em&gt;Dead or Alive&lt;/em&gt; fame. Team Ninja is also behind the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt;-ification of franchises like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem, &lt;/em&gt;as well as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Other_M"&gt;the most controversial &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. From its pedigreed developer, whatever form &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; was going to take, it was going to be unlike anything the franchise had ever seen — and that’s a good thing. The &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series has been around for almost 35 years, and it’s refreshing to see Square Enix continue to try new things. Square Enix has done new and weird things with its IP (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689462/nintendo-direct-september-2021-trailers-announcements"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chocobo GP&lt;/em&gt; anyone?&lt;/a&gt;), but I’d argue a spinoff action game hasn’t been seen since the likes of 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtHmv6"&gt;That’s the vibe I get playing &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; — like it’s Square Enix’s attempt to relitigate the merits of &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt; while adding a dash of &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; for flavor. There’s a break gauge that functions almost like &lt;em&gt;Sekiro&lt;/em&gt;’s posture gauge — depleting it makes enemies vulnerable to special finishers, but you are similarly vulnerable if your break gauge depletes. In a growing market of Soulslike games, &lt;em&gt;Strangers In Paradise&lt;/em&gt; fits. While not being quite as hard as the famously difficult From Software games, &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; asks a little bit more critical thinking from its players. You cannot spam attacks like you can in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and expect to walk out alive. And once you get the hang of changing combos and switching jobs, the combat is pretty cool. There’s also a relentless gloominess present in &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise &lt;/em&gt;that was in &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt;. But unlike &lt;em&gt;Dirge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; seems to be self-aware of its edgelordiness to comedic effect. Take the gameplay clip that’s gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8QtBvJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWUwqF947rA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12OmvU"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;. There is something so relatable to Jack — not Squall, not Cloud, not Lighting, but... &lt;em&gt;Jack&lt;/em&gt; — essentially throwing up deuces and making his exit while sick tunes blare from his earbuds. In this one moment, Jack became the millennial &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; protagonist. He’s masked up, pissed off, and finds himself outnumbered and outgunned on a seemingly futile quest to defeat an oppressive and eternal evil while toothy assholes block his path. No, seriously — one way you progress through a zone is by destroying what are essentially tooth-ringed, pulsing butthole monsters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__TVqgK3waK7Sml-5b3CXvQi5Xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901108/FA4wpCgX0AQ8oJp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;That’s a butthole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIKSG9"&gt;Is this just a poorly conceived monster idea or a well-crafted meditation on the kind of people who block humanity’s progress? You be the judge. I know the conversation around &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&lt;/em&gt; centers on a cutscene people might interpret as cringe, but that cringe accompanies a demo that’s weirdly compelling and a great new direction for the seminal franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXTLss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin &lt;/em&gt;releases on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC March 18, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p99jvl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0Qx5icf91JlXCq-1SEPtG9q6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948694/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC6Rko"&gt;After failing all tests for most of the day, a test of ISP DNS servers via &lt;a href="http://DNSchecker.org"&gt;DNSchecker.org&lt;/a&gt; showed most of them successfully finding a route to &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; at 5:30PM ET. A few minutes later, we were able to start using Facebook and Instagram normally; however, it may take time for the DNS fixes to reach everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="edlDtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook engineers were dispatched to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” Mike Schroepfer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;who will step down from his post as CTO next year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdUNeh"&gt;Inside Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;the outage has broken nearly all of the internal systems employees use to communicate and work&lt;/a&gt;. Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts, though employees can’t receive emails from external addresses. Employees who were logged into work tools such as Google Docs and Zoom before the outage can still use those, but any employee who needs to log in with their work email was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht1q2C"&gt;Facebook engineers have been sent to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem, according to two people familiar with the situation. That meant the outage, already Facebook’s most severe in years, could be further prolonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l3G5TB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"},{"title":"Twitter is up, Facebook is down, and Jack Dorsey is laughing ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems were widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms were unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXykPn"&gt;Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — were suddenly “withdrawn from the internet.” While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over last night’s whistleblower report, there isn’t any information yet to suggest anything malicious is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; was flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely told us that something went wrong. The problem also affected its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users could load games they already have installed, and the browser works, but social features or installing new games didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhSAXC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXsyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, along with internal Facebook updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ06Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted outage is still ongoing, added information about the 2019 outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGZJ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNS updates suggest Facebook is closing in on a solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av16YP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLFXTJ"&gt;The Epic Games Store is taking a bit step towards further competing with more established PC game stores like Steam next week with a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-achievements-are-launching-next-week"&gt;proper achievement system&lt;/a&gt; (called, of course, “Epic Achievements”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoTX9E"&gt;To start, Epic Achievements will only be available on a few games, including &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pillars of Eternity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kena&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zombie Army 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered. &lt;/em&gt;Achievements will be broken up into four levels: Bronze (which award 5-45 XP), Silver (50-95 XP), Gold (100-200 XP), and Platinum (which is awarded upon achieving 1000 XP in a game and awards players with an additional 250 XP on their profiles).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8JjjF7Xl43NpZ7MVSRFOyZtNF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900962/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_5.00.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JzQehS"&gt;Games that are updated to support Epic Achievements will now show those achievements on the game’s page in the store, in addition to player’s libraries, where they’ll be able to track progress and see how far they’ve progressed towards a particular challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6RaJu"&gt;Right now, accumulating experience points doesn’t actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything, however, beyond giving players a sense of pride and accomplishment; Epic promises that it’ll be adding “new social features and player rewards” centered on achievements later this year, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfyoKy"&gt;The Epic Games Store has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1288520483147833346"&gt;technically offered achievements&lt;/a&gt; for over a year when it started testing what the company called “an early version of the feature,” but the coming launch next week promises a more comprehensive system that will span games, allowing players to gain experience on a platform-wide level, similar to Xbox’s Gamerscore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltpJem"&gt;Legacy achievements already in games will stick around as “developer achievements” that exist solely at the discretion of the developer, although developers will have the option to convert existing developer achievements over Epic Achievements if they wish (which will also maintain player progress). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s Google partnership now includes an ‘exclusive’ cloud storage plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3IOnO6iMCZa3k03V7fnxzghcqk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950406/ajohnson_210813_4713_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0u1gtV"&gt;T-Mobile and Google &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobile-google-one&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F4%2F22709452%2Ft-mobile-google-one-cloud-storage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; they’re offering an “exclusive” plan with 500GB of Google One cloud storage for T-Mobile customers starting October 12th. The plan will cost $5 per month, the latest addition in an ongoing partnership between the search giant and the mobile carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXle9c"&gt;Google offers Google One plans &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans"&gt;in a variety of sizes&lt;/a&gt; but, up until this point, didn’t have a 500GB tier, jumping from 200GB for $2.99 per month straight to 2TB for $9.99 per month. Anyone with a Google account gets 15GB for free, but T-Mobile’s offer could work as a nice middle ground if you’ve started to store more of your files in Google Drive and Google Photos. T-Mobile also says the plan can be shared with up to five other people, whether or not they have T-Mobile accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cvvIHL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile and Google started collaborating earlier this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsXeoD"&gt;T-Mobile and Google first announced their partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;at the end of March this year&lt;/a&gt; for a set of still undisclosed financial terms. T-Mobile agreed to support Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18137937/rcs-rich-communication-service-messaging-explainer-what-is-google-chat"&gt;messaging standard of choice, RCS&lt;/a&gt;, offer Google’s Android Messages as the default messaging app, and push YouTube TV and YouTube Premium through a variety of different deals. At the time, neither company included a deal to push Google One as T-Mobile’s official backup method for Android phones. But lo and behold, on October 12th, T-Mobile will now have an option for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btQTKt"&gt;Customers can sign up for the Google One deal through T-Mobile. The company says it’ll offer a 30-day free trial before it starts charging $5 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to upgrade to Windows 11 without waiting in line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cy_Rk8Cy4tPRNKRGbxc6XTPI6-Q=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950095/twarren__windows11main_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Au8ANT"&gt;Windows 11 is now available and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472519"&gt;will be rolling out to millions of PCs worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. But, as with any new OS rollout, it’s not going to happen overnight, and many Windows users will be waiting for a while until that magic upgrade notice appears. Don’t want to wait? You don’t have to — you can, with just a little effort, download and install the new version of Windows right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ2ul9"&gt;Keep in mind, though, that unlike previous versions of Windows, you may not be invited to install Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;if your machine isn’t considered up to its standard&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn’t mean that you can’t install the new OS — Microsoft has said if you have an older machine, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;will be able to access Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, but you’ll have to download an ISO file of Windows 11 and install the OS manually. (However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee"&gt;you may not get automatic updates&lt;/a&gt; — you may have to install a new ISO each time instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sud2Gv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Planning to upgrade to Windows 11? A checklist before you do ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22469447"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jTOlnX"&gt;Now that the update is rolling out, you can check to see if it’s arrived at your machine by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Windows Update.” If you haven’t gotten the upgrade yet, and you want to see if your machine is considered good enough for Windows 11, you can download Microsoft’s PC Health App (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;), which should tell you whether your machine qualifies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yY15r"&gt;If it does, and you don’t want to wait, here’s how to install Windows 11:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Installation Assistant should make it easy to install Windows 11." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TTu4TrRsXt1oVjO2263ZuaTAuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900873/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Installation Assistant should make it easy to install Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2gCP5o"&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindows11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows 11 software download page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RYIUWp"&gt;If you want to do it the easy way, use the Windows 11 Installation Assistant; just click “Download Now” and follow the instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GQT1Q"&gt;You can also create a bootable USB or DVD by selecting “Create Windows 11 Installation Media.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekKNCO"&gt;And finally, you can download a disk image (ISO) for either bootable media or a virtual machine install.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="V9owEb"&gt;Follow the directions, and you should be good for an immediate install of Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new 17.3-inch Nitro 5 seems like a lot of bang for your buck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FB0zkfgmoZFW41fzSa0IgUOlVY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950036/acernitro52021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lW9aZ"&gt;Acer has refreshed its Nitro 5 lineup of entry-level gaming laptops for the second half of 2021, and its new 17.3-inch model launching in mid-October seems particularly impressive given its $1,199.99 price. Its 1080p display has a 144Hz refresh rate, and it comes equipped with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip. (Acer hasn’t specified the CPU model or what the maximum graphics power of the GPU will be.) Other specs include 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB SSD. That sounds like a solid gaming laptop to me, so long as you’re not expecting too much out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TndUFB"&gt;If you want something smaller, Acer also has a 15.6-inch version coming in mid-October for $769.99. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate screen, but as you might have guessed with the $400 price difference, there’s more than just size that gets a reduction here. It has an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 256GB SSD, and on the graphics side of things, it features the Nvidia GTX 1650. This should still be able to do some light gaming, but it’ll likely be a more compromised experience than what the 17.3-inch can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b8cYw"&gt;Both models have an ethernet port and a Thunderbolt 4 port, in addition to three USB-A ports, HDMI out, a 3.5mm jack, and a Kensington slot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UplLxr5Tks_TB1acuud3oK0YZus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900721/acernitro52021_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro 5 charges via the barrel plug port on its side instead of its rear, where it was located on the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dPNhAV"&gt;Acer gave the latest Nitro 5 just a couple of minor design adjustments that make it stand out a bit compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;to the early 2021 model&lt;/a&gt;. It still has a red and black colorway with edges that taper off, along with a full-size keyboard. The barrel plug charger now plugs in along the right side of the laptop instead of its back, and parts of its lid and chassis appear to have a grippier texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADumaN"&gt;If you just got the Nitro 5 or a similar gaming laptop earlier this year, these upgrades don’t seem like must-haves. But if you’re in the market for a 17.3-inch machine, Acer’s latest seems like a fantastic value.&lt;/p&gt;
