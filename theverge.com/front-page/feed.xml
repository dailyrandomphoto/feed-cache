    <title>The isolation of grief in the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmKaVyf01WghYfte60lezM1UW_A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183241/acastro_210422_4549_griefIsolation_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pandemic separates us when we need people most&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Vtv0uG"&gt;Many people adopted a pet during the COVID-19 pandemic. My wife and I just lost one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFTbVm"&gt;Gouda, our eight-and-a-half-year-old exotic shorthair cat, died on April 16th. We rushed him to the hospital the previous morning after he spent another night vomiting. The doctors weren’t sure what was wrong, but, over the course of 24 hours, signs pointed to fatal kidney disease. We made the difficult choice to euthanize him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byhG2M"&gt;The events would have been horrible under any circumstances. But I found that the forced isolation of the pandemic made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202122/coronavirus-grief-mourning-isolation-funeral-die-alone"&gt;grieving a lost family member&lt;/a&gt; even more challenging than I could have possibly imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KW3Uli"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We were stranded in pods of sadness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ylOP"&gt;My wife and I spent the majority of the 24 hours inside a Zipcar parked outside the animal hospital. Due to safety regulations, we couldn’t wait in the lobby, so we — and all of the other families worried about their pets — waited alone in our cars. Despite being feet away from each other, we were all worlds apart, stranded in pods of sadness made of metal and glass. Once, we watched as a woman handed off her cat to the veterinary staff, got back in her car, and broke down sobbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC2n68"&gt;We spent hours staring blankly at the tall hedges in front of our car. My wife’s iPhone was a lifeline and a curse. With each passing second, we desperately hoped for a call, but each time the phone finally rang, the news was worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRpbJA"&gt;As we attempted to sleep in the Zipcar overnight, the phone was perched on the dashboard. I stared at it in between fits of sleep, dreading when it would ring. We could never talk to the vets in person, meaning we couldn’t see body language, facial expressions, eye contact — nonverbal cues that would have helped us make the most difficult decision of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8iG8Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our masks filled with snot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cr4jo7"&gt;When we went in to see Gouda for our final goodbye, we sat in a dimly lit room on a soft couch. Our masks constantly filled up with snot. From the other side of the room, the staff told us we couldn’t be with Gouda when he died. There would be no easy way to be six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3UhCy"&gt;The only time we were close to another human being is when they handed Gouda to us, wrapped in a blanket, cone around his neck, and drugged out of his mind. As soon as we were alone with him, we ripped off our masks so we could kiss him one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8uY69"&gt;We got the last phone call on the ride home from the hospital. Gouda had died peacefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlElFN"&gt;Right after, my wife and I realized we didn’t want to be home, but we had nowhere else to go. We’re not vaccinated from COVID-19 yet, so we can’t see our family or friends in person to find solace. We couldn’t escape our empty studio apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5AbA3"&gt;Out of habit, we opened the front door gingerly. Every day for more than eight and a half years, Gouda had always greeted us, sometimes throwing his whole body against the door in his excitement to see us. But he wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jvZ4l"&gt;Instead, we saw his food bowl, his scratching post, his toys. Our apartment had been the one place we had felt truly safe during the pandemic, but it was now filled with reminders of our missing family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSUkaU"&gt;So we began to clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1RiFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uyJS6g"&gt;Usually, getting rid of things comes easily to my wife and me. We have internalized much of what Marie Kondo writes about in &lt;em&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/em&gt;. But this was different. It was harder than any cleaning we had done before &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the things we got rid of were the reminders of our missing family member. We couldn’t fully move on if we kept them, but that didn’t make it easy to let them go. And because of the pandemic, we couldn’t ask others to come over and help. We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIt1L"&gt;I will never know how grieving this death would have been different if we weren’t still in the pandemic. I do think it made the worst moments even worse. It trapped us in our car. It kept us from him in the hospital. It separated us from our families. It locked us in our home with the memories of our lost family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwBATZ"&gt;And yet, the pandemic forces us to face our grief head-on. My wife and I are healing, slowly. We spend the day crying and remembering. We say one nice thing about Gouda before bed. Because we are vulnerable with each other, I don’t feel like I’m bottling up any feelings, so my mind doesn’t race, and I can go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CPNOsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I thanked every one of Gouda’s things&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpRPDX"&gt;Kondo recommends thanking objects that you remove from your house to acknowledge the role they played in your life. I did that for every one of Gouda’s things. “Thank you, scratching post,” I said. “Thank you, plastic Easter egg. Thank you, food placemat.” I even thanked his litter box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhsbvP"&gt;Thanking Gouda’s things may sound trivial. But it was one of the few rituals left to me during the pandemic, when so much has been taken away, and it helped me recognize everything that Gouda gave to me. He taught me responsibility, caring for and feeding him every day. He taught me how to play, crouching just out of sight around the bed so that he could spring toward me. He taught me about love, snuggled above my head on my pillow in the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a5y06w"&gt;Thank you, Gouda.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit faces lawsuit for failing to remove child sexual abuse material</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_229QKPAWFPxKemCKsNgHl4pw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69182835/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SOr9NM"&gt;A woman &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.818322/gov.uscourts.cacd.818322.1.0.pdf"&gt;has sued Reddit&lt;/a&gt; for allowing an ex-boyfriend to repeatedly post pornographic images of her as a 16-year-old. The lawsuit applies controversial measures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;instituted in 2018 under FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt; to a site that’s drawn particular criticism for child sexualization. The resulting case will test the limits of platforms’ legal shields amid ongoing efforts to pare back the law behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vmdkj"&gt;The woman, identified under the pseudonym Jane Doe, argues that “Reddit knowingly benefits from lax enforcement of its content polices, including for child pornography.” She claims that in 2019, an abusive ex-boyfriend posted sexual photos and videos that he’d taken without her knowledge or consent. But when she alerted Reddit moderators, they could wait “several days” before removing the content, while Reddit administrators allowed the man to keep posting and create a new account when his old account was banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9duwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Footage allegedly spread on the ‘darkest and most disturbing’ corners of Reddit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XmyyQH"&gt;“Because Reddit refused to help, it fell to Jane Doe to monitor no less than 36 subreddits — that she knows of — which Reddit allowed her ex-boyfriend to repeatedly use to repeatedly post child pornography,” the complaint reads. “Reddit’s refusal to act has meant that for the past several years Jane Doe has been forced to log on to Reddit and spend hours looking through some of its darkest and most disturbing subreddits so that she can locate the posts of her underage self and then fight with Reddit to have them removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOIFWY"&gt;The woman is seeking a class action suit representing anyone who had similar photos or videos posted on Reddit while they were under 18 years of age. She’s accusing Reddit of distributing child pornography, failing to report child sexual abuse material, and violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It’s unclear whether the ex-boyfriend — who would be fully liable for posting the images — has been sued or criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mk4obF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Reddit has itself admitted that it is aware of the presence of child pornography’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ESYay"&gt;The complaint cites FOSTA-SESTA, an amendment to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as a central element of the lawsuit. Section 230 provides a broad legal shield for “interactive computer services” like Reddit, limiting their liability if users post illegal content. But the 2018 FOSTA-SESTA bill removed protections for sex trafficking-related material. The lawsuit apparently argues Jane Doe’s case meets that definition because Reddit’s advertising revenue turned the video into a “commercial sex act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg89jp"&gt;The lawsuit argues that Reddit knew its site was a hub for illegal photos and videos, based on news coverage and tips from users themselves, and it should have done more to protect victims. “Reddit has itself admitted that it is aware of the presence of child pornography on its website,” the complaint reads. Among other questionable content, it lists several now-removed subreddits with titles referencing “jailbait,” including &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1py6tb/the_closing_of_rjailbait/"&gt;an infamous forum&lt;/a&gt; that was removed in 2011 after media controversy. (That subreddit did not allow nude images, but it encouraged sexually suggestive ones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1XkiD"&gt;Reddit denies that it condoned abuse. “Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) has no place on the Reddit platform. We actively maintain policies and procedures that don’t just follow the law, but go above and beyond it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We deploy both automated tools and human intelligence to proactively detect and prevent the dissemination of CSAM material. When we find such material, we purge it and permanently ban the user from accessing Reddit. We also take the steps required under law to report the relevant user(s) and preserve any necessary user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KPPHbG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit banned sexualized images of children in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoXpag"&gt;Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/"&gt;banned child sexualization&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, saying that interpreting “vague and debated legal guidelines” over what counted as illegal child pornography risked pulling Reddit into a “legal quagmire.” But the suit alleges that Reddit fails to enforce its guidelines, particularly because it outsources moderation to unpaid volunteers who manage individual subreddits. “Reddit’s internal security has been compromised by its choice to rely on unpaid moderators, which fail to enforce the standards that are supposed to protect Reddit users and others,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Umlp"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA had immediate and damaging repercussions for sex workers, who — thanks to US laws that conflate consensual sex work with trafficking — faced a broad online crackdown. Meanwhile, anti-trafficking lawsuits relying on FOSTA-SESTA have appeared more gradually, and their results have been less clear. Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/facebook-asks-texas-high-court-to-toss-claims-of-sex-trafficking-victims/"&gt;currently embroiled&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181008/17533740793/facebook-whose-support-made-fosta-law-now-sued-facilitating-sex-trafficking-under-fosta.shtml"&gt;long-running&lt;/a&gt; Texas case claiming the site allowed traffickers to recruit victims. University of Notre Dame law professor Alex Yelderman &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/01/new-civil-fosta-lawsuits-push-expansive-legal-theories-against-unexpected-defendants-guest-blog-post.htm"&gt;wrote about some other early cases&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2020, including complaints targeting online marketplace Craigslist and email marketing company MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zIwak"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FOSTA-SESTA was aimed at escort sites&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHVkx2"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA was aimed at taking down escort sites like Backpage, which hosted ads for illegal sexual services. (Notably, Backpage’s operators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13206388/backpage-com-ceo-arrested-for-sex-trafficking"&gt;were arrested&lt;/a&gt; before FOSTA-SESTA became law.) But this lawsuit covers a very different and less directly trafficking-related situation: a site failing to remove nonconsensual pornography involving a minor. The firm behind the case, Susman Godfrey LLP, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.811224/gov.uscourts.cacd.811224.1.0.pdf"&gt;used a similar argument&lt;/a&gt; against porn giant MindGeek in February — saying video site Pornhub violated trafficking laws by hosting underage sexual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U70zaw"&gt;If courts don’t agree that sharing the images constitutes trafficking, Section 230 would likely protect Reddit from civil liability. Section 230 doesn’t protect sites from federal charges, including ones related to child sexual exploitation, but there’s no indication Reddit is in danger of criminal prosecution in connection with this incident. And there is no FOSTA-SESTA-style carveout exempting child sexual abuse material from Section 230 civil protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iV5ZH5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Section 230 doesn’t have a carveout for civil child sexual abuse suits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SBLXuL"&gt;Some lawmakers have pushed for broader limits to Section 230. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311464/earn-it-act-section-230-child-abuse-imagery-facebook-youtube-lindsey-graham"&gt;The EARN IT Act&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, would make services potentially liable for child sexual abuse material unless they hewed to a set of best practices. But its open-ended language alarmed privacy advocates who saw it as a potential attack on encryption, and it hasn’t proceeded to a vote on the House or Senate floor. Changing (or repealing) Section 230 could also drag sites and apps into protracted court battles over moderation decisions, particularly smaller services without the legal resources of tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4ej8Q"&gt;Much of the debate over Section 230 has focused on Facebook, Alphabet, and other massive Silicon Valley companies. Suits like this one highlight FOSTA-SESTA’s potential impact on mid-sized web services. They also, however, highlight harmful failures in services like Reddit — whose &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/reddit-powermods-war"&gt;hybrid moderation system&lt;/a&gt; has created gaps that abusers can easily exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pentagon reportedly gave a small company control of its IP addresses to find security issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xR1PIxlhh-qJVOxe9RqLbmL7pO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181429/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8KX7F2"&gt;As part of an apparent effort to find holes in its network, the US Department of Defense has given a tiny Florida company control over about 175 million of its IP addresses, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/24/pentagon-internet-address-mystery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rQmG"&gt;Global Resource Systems began managing the IP addresses on January 20th, part of what a Pentagon spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; was a “pilot effort” to “identify potential vulnerabilities” and “prevent unauthorized use of DoD IP address space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSbrd"&gt;The Department of Defense still owns the IP addresses. Global Resource Systems was founded in September, according to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, which was not able to find any other federal contracts for the company or any public-facing website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgw5h"&gt;The initiative is apparently being run by a group within the Pentagon called Defense Digital Service, which solves problems and does technology experiments for the military. The group reports directly to the secretary of defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jo9brl"&gt;What exactly Global Resource Systems has been tasked with doing for the DoD isn’t known, but the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; found it sent a “fire hose of internet traffic” at the DoD IP addresses. One security expert speculated that it may give the DoD information about how attackers operate online, and any possibly misconfigurations that need to be repaired. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone deciphered the Ted Lasso shortbread recipe from Apple’s Spring Loaded event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2cbUx1T-EnEoNzr1RiJ88xhlik=/251x0:3491x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181353/1310836738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by 27th Annual SAG Awards/Getty Images for WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5eVII"&gt;During Tuesday’s Spring Loaded event, Apple announced (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;among other things&lt;/a&gt;) that the second season of its runaway hit show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;drop on July 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. This is extremely good news for fans of the show (including myself) who have missed the earnest football coach with the impossibly sunny outlook on life, which provided a bit of a respite during the coronavirus pandemic last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2J6Vb"&gt;At the very end of Spring Loaded, however, there was a &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso-&lt;/em&gt;related Easter egg: a graphic of a little box with the text “Ted Lasso’s Secret Shortbread (Makes about one box).” The recipe itself was barely visible. But eagle-eyed developer David Smith was &lt;a href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2021/04/21/breadcrumbs/"&gt;able to read the text&lt;/a&gt;, and Googled it, only to find it matched a &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020851-bittersweet-brownie-shortbread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recipe&lt;/a&gt; for shortbread (albeit a slightly different recipe than Ted’s). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrfXiPQ_-Js1hcJQjeb3_RwTaik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467320/ted_lasso_recipe.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n8hFOz"&gt;He blogged about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dqJMbm"&gt;Looking closely at the fractional letters visible I’m pretty confident that this first line reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d05zAA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 1/2 cups / 340 grams cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces plus more for greasing pan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iTr3K"&gt;This is definitely a recipe for shortbread, I mean what else would need that much butter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tYXH"&gt;That really is a lot of goddamned butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM5Icz"&gt;For those who don’t watch the show (and why the heck not?), the shortbread cookies are a key part of the plot. Ted is trying to win over Rebecca, the owner of the English football team he’s suddenly coaching, and presents her with a small pink box that has the shortbread inside (we later discover that Ted has been baking the shortbread himself, not purchasing them, because that’s Ted for ya).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk is hosting Saturday Night Live and no this is not a joke</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Acvs7t"&gt;Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, will be hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; on May 8th, the official &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?s=21"&gt;tweeted &lt;/a&gt;Saturday. The musical guest will be Miley Cyrus. Musk is known for his— how shall we put this — quirky sense of humor on Twitter, his preferred method of social media communication, but it’s not totally clear whether he’s actually funny enough to sustain a 90-minute hosting gig on the late-night comedy show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KpH6x6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/WyTGhSsSVg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WyTGhSsSVg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4tHbM"&gt;Musk has made many notable media appearances over the years— there was that time he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/tech/elon-musk-joe-rogan"&gt;smoked weed on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and he had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfiRd4Y5z_g&amp;amp;ab_channel=ShortClips"&gt;cameo in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (he even had a line for his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). He also played himself on an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, titled “&lt;a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth"&gt;The Musk Who Fell to Earth&lt;/a&gt;,” and on the now-retired show &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGR5HP3KSBk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and its spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jAlPQau5Hc&amp;amp;ab_channel=HouseofGamers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Sheldon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When he appeared on the Stephen Colbert show, the host&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV6hP9wpMW8&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheLateShowwithStephenColbert"&gt; likened him to Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; (which, all things considered, he probably enjoyed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJ794"&gt;So he’s not totally without some show biz chops. How willing he’ll be to parody his — unique— public persona, well, we’ll have to wait a few weeks to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this saga of McDonald’s ice cream machines and why they’re out of order all the time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="McDonald’s Same-Store Sales Top Estimates as Declines Abate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgKJgvfBho7BoLU0BzmsIlVHuaU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180993/462010750.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sCitTa"&gt;If you’ve ever tried to get ice cream at a McDonald’s restaurant, there’s a better-than-average chance you were stymied in your quest for soft-serve goodness by an out-of-order ice cream machine. A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/they-hacked-mcdonalds-ice-cream-makers-started-cold-war/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery of the McDonald’s ice cream machines, why they have a secret repair menu that most McDonald’s workers don’t have access to, and one couple’s attempts to hack the machines for the greater good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4gcX0p"&gt;...after years of studying this complex machine and its many ways of failing, O’Sullivan remains most outraged at this notion: That the food-equipment giant Taylor sells the McFlurry-squirting devices to McDonald’s restaurant owners for about $18,000 each, and yet it keeps the machines’ inner workings secret from them. What’s more, Taylor maintains a network of approved distributors that charge franchisees thousands of dollars a year for pricey maintenance contracts, with technicians on call to come and tap that secret passcode into the devices sitting on their counters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iWiX7L"&gt;It’s weird to consider that a company the size of McDonald’s would be hampered by what is mainly a right-to-repair issue. The restaurants have to use Taylor’s repair techs, and the machines themselves tend to be fragile and temperamental, according to franchisees bound to use the machines by agreements with McDonald’s. So Jeremy O’Sullivan and Melissa Nelson created a device that would hack into the machines and provide diagnostic info, including access to the secret menu. They called it Kytch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6BL50x"&gt;One franchisee, who asked that WIRED not identify him for fear of retribution from McDonald’s, told me that the ice cream machine at one of his restaurants had been down practically every week due to a mysterious failure during its pasteurization cycle. He’d scrutinized the assembly of the machine again and again, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqzCZW"&gt;Installing Kytch revealed almost instantly that an overeager employee was putting too much mix in one of the machine’s hoppers. Today he wakes up every morning at 5:30, picks up his phone, and confirms that all his machines have passed their treacherous heat treatment. Another franchisee’s technician told me that, despite Kytch nearly doubling its prices over the past two years and adding a $250 activation fee, it still saves their owner “easily thousands of dollars a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JIYBC0"&gt;I’m not going to spoil the plot twists, but suffice to say that &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reporter Andy Greenberg tells the tale of the ice cream machines and the well-intentioned hackers almost like a spy thriller; I was half-expecting a Jason Bourne-like hero to come in and set everything right. Go read this fascinating deep dive into the wonky ice cream machines that even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds/status/1293189912913743877?s=20"&gt;McDonald’s itself jokes about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zbdabt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter censored tweets critical of India’s handling of the pandemic at its government’s request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd6hjZ2eLcuDhwLFDXNosuGXH6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180500/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pH0mtx"&gt;Twitter has removed more than 50 tweets critical of the Indian government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and did so at the request of the Indian government. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.medianama.com/2021/04/223-twitter-mp-minister-censor/"&gt;Indian news site &lt;em&gt;MediaNama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian government sent Twitter an emergency order on Friday to censor 52 tweets, according to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466918/April_23_2021_Lumen_India.pdf"&gt;disclosure notice on the Lumen database&lt;/a&gt;. The censored accounts include a sitting member of India’s Parliament, two filmmakers, an actor, and a West Bengal state minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmRLuS"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company may make certain tweets unable to be viewed by people within India if the tweets violate local law. Twitter says it notified account holders before it withheld content to make them aware that the action was taken in response to a legal request from the government of India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUt8Lk"&gt;“When we receive a valid legal request, we review it under both the Twitter Rules and local law. If the content violates Twitter’s Rules, the content will be removed from the service,” according to the Twitter spokesperson. “If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only. In all cases, we notify the account holder directly so they’re aware that we’ve received a legal order pertaining to the account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvMJg3"&gt;It isn’t the first time that Twitter has bowed to pressure from the Indian government. During protests by farmers in February, the company permanently blocked more than 500 accounts and removed others from being visible within India. The Indian government issued a notice of noncompliance to the company, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time, which could have meant jail time for Twitter’s employees in India if the company had refused. Among the accounts suspended in February was Indian news magazine &lt;em&gt;The Caravan&lt;/em&gt; (which was later reinstated): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SzqJ2f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The official handle of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecaravanindia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thecaravanindia&lt;/a&gt; is withheld in India: &lt;a href="https://t.co/2t4FV5IgM0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2t4FV5IgM0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Vinod K. Jose (@vinodjose) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinodjose/status/1356165300840968192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iSuPzN"&gt;Indian law restricts the publication of material that the government considers defamatory, or which could incite violence. According to the Lumen notice, one of the tweets that was censored in India (but which is still visible outside the country) was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhatakMoloy/status/1384385821956923393"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from West Bengal state minister Moloy Ghatak, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOs8iG"&gt;“India will never forgive PM @narendramodi for underplaying the corona situation in the country and letting so many people die due to mismanagement. At a time when India is going through a health crisis, PM chose to export millions of vaccine to other nations,” the tweet reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QfCQDc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;India will never forgive PM &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@narendramodi&lt;/a&gt; for underplaying the corona situation in the country and letting so many people die due to mismanagement.&lt;br&gt;At a time when India is going through a health crisis,PM chose to export millions of vaccine to other nations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ModiHataoDeshBachao?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ModiHataoDeshBachao&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5sQRfT7kpB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5sQRfT7kpB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Moloy Ghatak (@GhatakMoloy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhatakMoloy/status/1384385821956923393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYLxHz"&gt;India is in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19 cases, which has made ventilators, medicine, and oxygen scarce. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported 346,786 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus on Friday, a new record high, and 2,624 deaths, also a new record. Less than 1.5 percent of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8njKe5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How many layers of copyright infringement are in Emily Ratajkowski’s new NFT?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of Emily Ratajkowski in front of a painting by Richard Prince, which includes a photo of Ratajkowski." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5I8lfBLV6A7Qet_GVBmjHIJLH8k=/0x569:1366x1480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180421/23EMRATANFT_superJumbo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Emily Ratajkowski’s artwork is being sold as an NFT. | Image: Emily Ratajkowski&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vfJTtO"&gt;Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski is selling a link representing a composite image that features a photograph of herself in front of a print by another artist that contains a photo (of herself) taken by (presumably) yet another artist. In other words, she is selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS85fu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/style/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Ratajkowski will be selling the NFT at Christie’s, the storied auction house that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold Beeple’s NFT for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March. The NFT is, for Ratajkowski, an effort to reclaim images of herself that have been created and sold, sometimes without her permission, throughout her career. Last year, Ratajkowski &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html"&gt;published an essay in &lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing moments when she was unable to control often vulnerable images of herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of Emily Ratajkowski in front of a painting by Richard Prince, which includes a photo of Ratajkowski." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ISRzqE60tjYHGWOumONYDGBKeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465946/23EMRATANFT_superJumbo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emily Ratajkowski&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A0l1Md"&gt;“As somebody who has built a career off of sharing my image, so many times — even though that’s my livelihood — it’s taken from me and then somebody else profits off of,” Ratajkowski told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The NFT, titled “Buying Myself Back: A Model for Redistribution,” is meant to let Ratajkowski profit directly, continually, and significantly off of works containing her image that she did not previously have much (or any) stake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz4d5P"&gt;The NFT, also, is a copyright nightmare, much like many of the images that Ratajkowski described grappling with throughout her career. To break down the situation at hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="PJOMC1"&gt;There is the NFT. An NFT contains, essentially, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;just a link&lt;/a&gt;, but the terms of sale imply ownership over whatever the NFT links to. Ratajkowski can definitively sell a link. Is she really selling the underlying image? Are all NFTs a sham? Further study is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t2wJYX"&gt;The composite artwork being NFT-ized contains two discrete images: the first is a photo of Ratajkowski in her apartment, the second is (what appears to be) a digital copy of a “painting” by Richard Prince. Someone owns the foreground photo of Ratajkowski in her apartment (possibly the photographer, possibly Ratajkowski herself). Ratajkowski owns a physical copy of the painting by Richard Prince, but she likely does not own rights to digitally reproduce it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LJIcsg"&gt;The Richard Prince painting is itself a copyright nightmare. It is a print of an Instagram post by Ratajkowski, which features a photo of Ratajkowski taken for &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a profile photo of Ratajkowski (possibly a selfie?) and comments written by other viewers of the photo. Richard Prince almost certainly did not get permission to use either of the photos or the comments included in his painting. Is the font copyright protected, too? Please help me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RaDJ88"&gt;This is an entire bullet point just to mention that Richard Prince’s entire thing as an artist is transforming other artists’ work, sometimes in fascinating ways, other times in really gimmicky ways, and seemingly always in ways that inevitably piss people off because he ends up making a ton of money off of minor alternations to someone else’s art. This approach has resulted in many complaints and lawsuits, which have mostly worked out in Prince’s favor, insofar as he has continued to work and make a lot of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SI0c1N"&gt;Ratajkowski is trolling Richard Prince by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17979422/richard-prince-instagram-lawsuit-fair-use-defense-guide"&gt;stealing his move&lt;/a&gt;, transforming his own work (a transformation of her), and reselling it (seemingly without his permission). Honestly, good work here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aExYrP"&gt;If we’re counting: there seem to be at least four images within this single image. We can reasonably assume that Ratajkowski owns two of them (the core photo of herself, plus her profile picture inside the Richard Prince painting). Richard Prince owns one of them (although that &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/proof-is-in-the-pixels-for-appropriation-artist-richard-prince/"&gt;could be litigated&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; and/or a photographer associated with &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; presumably owns the final image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGzYoD"&gt;You’ve gotta assume Richard Prince isn’t suing over this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gZHJYN"&gt;Ratajkowski has become, perhaps by necessity, a consistent proponent for allowing transformative use of photographs. In a lawsuit over a paparazzo’s photo she posted to her Instagram Story with a caption over top of it, &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/emily-ratajkowski-says-instagram-post-is-fair-use-in-extortion-copyright-case/"&gt;Ratajkowski has argued&lt;/a&gt; that her amendment to the photograph should qualify her work for fair use protections. (This is, of course, the same general argument that Richard Prince makes about his work. It’s messy!) A similar, albeit more deliberate, situation is at play here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WSUufS"&gt;More broadly, Ratajkowski seems to be pushing for a rethinking of copyright law that would give subjects more control over how their images are displayed and who profits off of them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ML1wLC"&gt;Maybe none of this matters anyway because, again, what even is an NFT?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="l5ez2h"&gt;Ratajkowski will receive a cut every time her NFT is resold, therefore giving herself some degree of continued ownership over her image(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KOEBka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The digital terrain should be a place where women can share their likeness as they choose, controlling the usage of their image and receiving whatever potential capital attached. Instead, the internet has more frequently served as a space where others exploit and distribute image&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emrata/status/1385710647204265987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qOllh"&gt;And here’s the wonderful thing about doing this all on the blockchain and other distributed networks: say copyright law comes crashing down on Ratajkowski, say the profits are taken from her and she’s ordered to stop marketing the NFT and reposting the image in the future — there’s still nothing anyone can do to wipe out the image. It’ll still be linked on the blockchain and hosted on a distributed network where she wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first problem was vaccine supply. Now, it’s demand.   </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PFK6XR"&gt;Thursday marked a major milestone in the United States’ COVID-19 vaccination campaign: 200 million shots given in President Biden’s first 100 days in office. Over 40 percent of the US population now has at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pidgWd"&gt;But over the past week, the average number of vaccinations reported per day started to fall. Last week, the US was averaging around 3.3 million shots per day. This week, that number dropped to around 3 million shots per day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hwHHuM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tgaSDY"&gt;Every one of those shots takes us another step closer to the end of the pandemic in the US. The slowing pace, though, is a warning sign that we’re reaching an inflection point where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines will outpace the demand. It’s already happening in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/21/states-covid-vaccine-problem-483872"&gt;some places&lt;/a&gt;: states have vials of vaccine, but people aren’t signing up for open appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuJyoW"&gt;We’re reaching that point because almost all of the people most eager to get vaccinated have already gotten their shots, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week. Polling from the end of March found that 61 percent of US adults wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible — around 157 million people. We’ve only got around 27 million people to go before we hit that number, which the report says could happen in &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;just a few weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AOMcE"&gt;“Once this happens, efforts to encourage vaccination will become much harder, presenting a challenge to reaching the levels of herd immunity that are expected to be needed,” the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;report read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgkHvV"&gt;Experts warned from the start of the pandemic that it would be a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;struggle to vaccinate everyone&lt;/a&gt;. A pocket of people in the US is skeptical of any and all vaccines. For some people, the fast development and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine seemed worrying; for others, the politicization of the pandemic means that they don’t think the virus is enough of an issue to go and get a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UG7vNN"&gt;Reaching some of those people will be harder than others. There’s a group of hard-line anti vaxxers who probably won’t ever get the shot, or at least won’t for a long time. People who identify as Republicans are &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/"&gt;most likely&lt;/a&gt; to fall into that category. No matter what outreach strategies doctors and officials use, this group of people will still probably turn the shot down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OTu6ON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As long as there are places with more supply than demand, then there is more work to be done on demand,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B4yZll"&gt;But a significant chunk of the people who aren’t particularly &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to get the vaccine say they still probably will get it, they’re just not actively tracking it down. That group doesn’t want to be first in line; they want to wait and see before they roll up their sleeves. With some effort and creativity, it’s possible to get them on board. It’ll take changing tactics. Officials may make it easier to get a vaccine by offering walk-in appointments. Communities may offer incentives, like the New Orleans bars and restaurants holding &lt;a href="https://nola.eater.com/2021/4/12/22376260/new-orleanss-bars-restaurants-join-covid-19-vaccination-effort-shot-for-shot"&gt;“shot-for-shot” events.&lt;/a&gt; People who have questions about the vaccine may prefer to get it at their doctor’s office instead of a vaccine site — talking with a trusted doctor is a powerful way to overcome hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFU1CP"&gt;“As long as there are places with more supply than demand, then there is more work to be done on demand,” said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/21/states-covid-vaccine-problem-483872"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If a strategy is only sort of working, which I think is the case, we could do better by experimenting with different approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZakFP"&gt;Figuring out a way to maintain the pace of vaccinations and get the available shots in arms is the next public health challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. As each person gets vaccinated, they’re safer, and their world expands. But they also start being able to protect others — the vaccines make it less likely that they’ll carry and spread the virus, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ILYqM"&gt;As the number of people who are vulnerable to catching it shrinks, the virus has fewer pathways to travel from person to person. At a certain point, once the vast majority of pathways are blocked off by people who are protected, it will become much harder for the virus to spread — a milestone called&lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html"&gt; herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still not entirely clear what that threshold is for this pandemic. The virus is still very new. But some experts think that about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370176/covid-19-vaccinated-people-cdc-guidance-herd-immunity"&gt;70 to 80 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in a population need to be vaccinated before herd immunity kicks in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VZs97"&gt;That’s why ending the pandemic isn’t individual — it’s collective. In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for everyone, we have to encourage as many people to get their shots as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="u2iNY2"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jBP2bS"&gt;The inoculation process has transformed into a tongue-in-cheek fashion choice; a Band-Aid plastered on your shoulder is the spiciest trend of the summer. We’ve all lived through an eternity of fad skirmishes — boxers vs. briefs, Coke vs. Pepsi, Nintendo vs. Sega — but nothing holds a candle to 2021 and our appointment for a subdermal, antibody-producing serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="L9fnz9"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="flNjhy"&gt;To the people who have received the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;993 million vaccine doses&lt;/a&gt; distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEgIM1"&gt;To the more than 145,098,784 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQtW82"&gt;To the families and friends of the 3,077,900 people who have died worldwide — 571,001 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZlBNf"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
