    <title>Tesla finally begins shipping ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta version 9 after a long delay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nAFbCb"&gt;Tesla began sending out over-the-air software updates for its long-awaited “Full Self-Driving” beta version 9, the definitely-not-autonomous-but-certainly-advanced driver assist system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgEQUy"&gt;As promised by Elon Musk, the software update (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/oher5v/tesla_fsd_beta_v9_202141812_initial_release/"&gt;2021.4.18.12&lt;/a&gt;) began uploading after midnight on Friday, giving thousands of Tesla owners who have purchased the FSD option access to the feature, which enables drivers to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7kFah"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc_KZTpp1LU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jla1G8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk has been promising v9 of the software for, well, a while now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mP4dyU"&gt;Musk has been promising v9 of the software for, well, a while now. He said in 2018 that the “long awaited” version of FSD would begin rolling out in August. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;He did it again in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.” Earlier this month, he claimed that “FSD 9 beta is shipping soon.” So to say that Tesla fans have been anticipating this update for a while would be an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyHgNR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New Visualizations. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fsdbeta?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fsdbeta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DamYuSmlNf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DamYuSmlNf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Burton (@EliBurton_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EliBurton_/status/1413767377032933376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a49K9n"&gt;The real question is whether it’s ready for primetime. To that, Musk gave a typical muddled response, tweeting that “Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.” He added, “Safety is always top priority at Tesla.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1413764413165772803"&gt;Release notes&lt;/a&gt; included with the update warn testers that “it may do the wrong thing at the worst time” and to avoid complacence. They also mention improvements to the cabin camera’s driver monitoring to check for attentiveness, along with updated, larger visualizations on the in-car display (as shown above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VrYNNY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Running preproduction software is both work &amp;amp; fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safety is always top priority at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413306409693892613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbqwKA"&gt;There’s no question that Tesla is more willing than its competitors to test beta versions of its Autopilot driver assist feature on its customers in the interest of gathering data and working out any bugs in the system. And Tesla customers are mostly fine with this, routinely flooding Musk’s mentions begging to be admitted into the company’s Early Access Program for beta testers. This has helped contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla’s public reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a leader in autonomous driving, despite its vehicles continuously falling short of what most experts would agree defines a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnfTPk"&gt;Tesla warns that drivers need to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times, though the automaker famously refuses to include a more robust driver-monitoring system (like infrared eye tracking, for example) to ensure its customers are following safety protocols (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;although maybe that’s changing&lt;/a&gt;). Autopilot is considered a Level 2 “partially automated” system by the Society of Automotive Engineers’ standards (and by Tesla’s lawyers), which requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ciBX"&gt;However, consumer advocates have proven that Tesla’s system can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;easily be tricked&lt;/a&gt; into thinking there’s someone in the driver seat, which gained renewed attention in the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;a fatal crash in Texas&lt;/a&gt; involving a Tesla, in which authorities said there was no one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s0AjGy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this hasn’t stopped some Tesla owners from abusing Autopilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrSOgM"&gt;But this hasn’t stopped some Tesla owners from abusing Autopilot — sometimes going so far as to film and publicize the results. Drivers have been caught sleeping in the passenger seat or backseat of their Teslas while the vehicle speeds down a crowded highway. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445168/tesla-driver-sleeping-police-charged-canada-autopilot"&gt;Canadian man was charged with reckless driving&lt;/a&gt; last year after being pulled over for sleeping while traveling at speeds of 93mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x47nWx"&gt;Since Tesla introduced Autopilot in 2015, there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/"&gt;11 deaths in nine crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the US that involved the driver assistance system. Internationally, there have been at least another nine deaths in seven additional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwRuVa"&gt;Meanwhile, the US government is requiring that car companies report crashes involving autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assist systems, often within a day of the incident. It was a major change that signals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557135/nhtsa-autonomous-adas-crash-rule-response-tesla"&gt;a tougher stance&lt;/a&gt; on these partially automated systems by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiKZI0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s never been easier to keep track of your keys&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Yn4hTB"&gt;This year will go down in history as the year we entered the golden age of Not Losing Your Stuff. Well, in addition to some other historic milestones, somewhere in the top 100 hits of the year will be the introduction of smart tracker tags from two major mobile device manufacturers: Samsung and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LL5zg"&gt;Tracking tags have been around for a while now, and Tile has been the best-known brand in the space. With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers entering the picture, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream. If you’re thinking of picking one up but unsure where to start, then you’re in the right place. We tried out three top tracking tags — the Samsung SmartTag Plus, Apple AirTag, and Tile Pro — to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXXOP8"&gt;First, a word about the very real privacy concerns about these tracking devices. Since their introduction, critics have noted that they could all too easily be used as tools for stalkers, since they’re easy to hide in someone’s bag or car. These concerns were amplified when Apple’s AirTags arrived, given how ubiquitous Apple’s Find My network is. Apple built in certain anti-stalking safety measures at launch, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;reporters quickly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"&gt;identified ways&lt;/a&gt; that these safeguards fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXhCa4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AwmYL"&gt;The company has addressed some issues, like shortening the length of time before an AirTag will sound an alert when it’s separated from its owner, and is working on an app that will allow Android users to find unwanted AirTags near them. But some potential for misuse will remain even with more safety measures in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au3ILG"&gt;Apple (justifiably) attracts more scrutiny for its safety practices given the size and effectiveness of its tracking network, but it’s hardly alone in its somewhat reactive attitude toward stalking concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;Samsung introduced a SmartThings app feature&lt;/a&gt; that scans for unfamiliar SmartTags, and Tile says it’s working on a similar feature. It doesn’t help that these devices more or less live inside their own manufacturer’s walled garden — a unified, cross-platform approach is sorely needed. Anyway, it’s illegal (and highly immoral) to track someone without their knowledge, so don’t do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayjCuN"&gt;Per usual, adding new tech to your life involves more terms and conditions to agree to. However, in this case you may have already accepted them when you set up your Apple or Samsung phone. Tile’s app, which you must download to use the Pro, presents its own separate set of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fterms-of-service&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfRRvwHF0x2ZIq0H7G1fIytsSkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702210/ajohnson_210702_4659_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile has been the best-known brand in the tracking tag space until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB8PcA"&gt;Personal trackers are nothing new — GPS and cellular options have been around for quite some time, and offer more precise, real-time location tracking. They also tend to come with a higher price tag, recurring subscription or wireless data fees, and require more battery power. This newer class of Bluetooth trackers are more practical for most people, with battery life measured in months rather than days and smaller, keyring-friendly form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiUx0"&gt;Essentially, the three tags compared here all do the same thing. Pair it to your phone, attach it to something you want to keep track of, and you’re ready to go. When the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can have the tag play a sound to help locate it. All three devices support out-of-range finding with their own particular device user networks, and they all include the same kind of user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlEXn2"&gt;Their main difference is whether or not they include AR-assisted finding by way of Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity: the Samsung and Apple tags have this and the Tile Pro does not. To take advantage of the AR feature, you’ll need a phone with UWB; on the Apple side that’s an iPhone 11 or newer, and for Samsung it’s a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Z Fold 2, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra. There are also compatibility differences: Apple’s tracker only works with iOS devices and Samsung’s only works with Galaxy devices (no, you can’t register it through the SmartThings iOS app, I tried), whereas Tile works on both iOS and Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMzWKLcxkNQ7oNoAy-D1TFh941U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702209/ajohnson_210702_4659_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag is the least expensive of the bunch, but without a built-in keyring hole you may need to buy a holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KkUjYi"&gt;Apple AirTag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="K8LyRt"&gt;The AirTag comes in just one flavor: a small, $29 disc shape. It’s the only one of the three to include an official IP67 rating, meaning it can survive a dunk in a bit of water. It also allows you to store your contact information so it can be read by any phone with NFC (near-field communication) — even Android phones. Setup is dead simple — just bring the tag near your iPhone and you’ll be prompted to pair the two. It’s also a little less expensive than the other two, but there’s no hole built in, so if you want to attach it to a set of keys you’ll need to pay a little more to add a holder. (We don’t really recommend drilling a hole into it, though &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FHow%2Bto%2BDrill%2Ba%2BKeyring%2BHole%2Bin%2Ban%2BAirTag%2F143068&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit has a guide&lt;/a&gt; if you insist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0KD9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OP3rsJ"&gt;When it’s outside the Bluetooth range of your phone, the AirTag taps into the massive network of iPhone devices using Find My to provide an approximate location. This is a huge benefit, especially in the US where iPhones abound. As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmpgHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkECyk"&gt;In-range, AR-assisted finding does a good job of tracking down an object that’s out of sight. A big, easy-to-follow arrow appears on screen when the signal is strong enough (you’ll be prompted with a vague message to move around if you’re too far for a strong signal) and guides you in the right direction. I had no problem locating a tag under a couch cushion in my house. It would be helpful if the “weak signal” message indicated if the signal got stronger as you move around (Samsung’s AR finding does this) but that’s my only complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0q41aP"&gt;If you’d like to altogether avoid the headache of leaving something behind, Apple is adding a separation alert feature in iOS 15 that may help. Once set up, it will send a notification if it detects that your iPhone (and by extension, you) have gone out of range and left it behind. Tile also offers this feature with its Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zu4DCPNye2enQZo0XfHl_FbQL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702211/ajohnson_210702_4659_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartTag Plus includes AR-assisted finding for objects in close range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="07bZ8a"&gt;Samsung SmartTag Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dHJGkw"&gt;The $39 SmartTag Plus is Samsung’s UWB-equipped tag; there’s also a non-UWB version for $10 less. The SmartTag Plus offers broadly similar Bluetooth-range finding and AR-assist as the AirTag, with a few differences. AR finding mode provides a view through the phone’s camera with guiding arrows that appear on the screen, which is a little more helpful than Apple’s arrow-only guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="doXMn8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDi1au"&gt;You can also use the button on a SmartTag as a kind of remote starter for smart home automations if you’re invested in Samsung’s SmartThings ecosystem. On the downside, the SmartTag has the shortest battery life rating of the three trackers compared here: up to 165 days (less than six months) compared to about a year for the Tile and Apple options. SmartTags don’t offer separation alerts at the moment either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZmIv6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBoLCQ"&gt;Out-of-range, the SmartTag Plus relies on other Galaxy devices that have chosen to participate in Samsung’s Galaxy Find network — Galaxy phone users aren’t opted in by default, and need to give consent in the SmartThings app. Samsung says that as of April 2021, there were &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745743505176533597" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 million “helper devices” participating globally&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple counts hundreds of millions of users&lt;/a&gt; in its Find My network. There are simply fewer people in the US with Galaxy phones than iPhones, so it can’t quite compete with the AirTag, but that’s a moot point anyway since nobody is likely to be comparison shopping between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2tdm2"&gt;Experiences will vary — more so than with an AirTag — but at least in the northern suburbs of Seattle, there were enough Galaxy Find users out and about to track a tag on a cross-town journey with multiple stops. Knowing the actual location of the object, er, spouse who agreed to let me track him, the SmartTag did identify his position accurately at two of three stops. It only returned a location a couple of times when he was on the interstate getting to his destination, but in a fairly busy business park and at a restaurant, the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNM85lo7N16YWsKU7QsiGNbEksk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702206/ajohnson_210702_4659_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s tags work with both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quRzYe"&gt;Tile Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mesvM"&gt;Tile has been the tracking tag category heavyweight of the last few years — at least until Samsung and Apple showed up. The Pro is the company’s highest-specced model at $34, with a bigger Bluetooth range (400 feet) and a louder maximum ring volume than other current Tile tags. There’s no Ultra Wideband here, and thus no AR-assisted finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yAgNuq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btTY78"&gt;Separation alerts are available as part of Tile’s $29/year Premium subscription, but all of the essential features are included with your Tile tag purchase, including out-of-range finding. This “community find” feature relies on other Tile users — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as of June 14th, Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; — the way Samsung and Apple’s trackers rely on other Galaxy phones and iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WzYkQ"&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s. On the same journey up I-5 that the SmartTag Plus took, the Tile Pro returned a location ping less frequently, and only got one of the stops on the trip precisely right (it was close but across the street on another one) where the SmartTag was accurate on two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUmqjJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OJlei"&gt;This was honestly a better performance than I was expecting, though Seattle probably has more than its usual share of Sidewalk-supporting Amazon devices for obvious reasons. Even if it’s an atypical result, it’s fair to say that the community find feature would work well enough to tell you that you really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; lose something, even if it’s less likely that you’ll be able to hunt down its exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbsdOV"&gt;I do have one minor complaint to lodge against the Tile app: the subscription upsell. A couple of app menus include features that are only available with the Premium plan, and tapping them brings up a page prompting you to start a free trial to access them. I expect to see those kinds of things during setup, or if I’m using a free app like Strava, but it’s a little annoying from something I’ve already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlbF1T"&gt;Tile also offers its trackers in a couple of different form factors, including a wallet-friendly Slim version and a small adhesive-backed Sticker tag. There are plenty of third-party cases and holders for AirTags in particular if you want to adapt it for different objects, but you can’t buy an AirTag or a SmartTag in a fundamentally different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="btAqHr"&gt;AirTag or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqsNHq"&gt;If you have an iPhone, there’s a very simple answer to this question: just get the AirTag. The Apple Find My network is so extensive (at least in the US) that you’ll have the best chance of tracking down something the tag is attached to. Maybe there’s an exception to this recommendation if you really want Tile’s subscription features or mix of form factors, but by and large this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RWH2Kx"&gt;SmartTag Plus or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pbD9SM"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone you’ll probably be better off with the SmartTag Plus. The Galaxy Find network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, but it’s still ahead of Tile’s. If you already use smart home devices in Samsung’s SmartThings network, then there’s even more reason to choose SmartTag since it can act as a remote control for automations. The shorter battery life is a shame and the lack of separation notifications stinks, so if those are sticking points you could consider the Tile Pro. Otherwise, the SmartTag Plus (or non-UWB version, depending on your phone) is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YS3j0F"&gt;Tile or… ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FHfboY"&gt;If you don’t have an iPhone or a Galaxy device, your choice is between the Tile Pro and… everything else. Tile’s out-of-range network can’t compete with the number of devices Samsung and Apple have in our pockets, but it seems to be getting a healthy boost from Sidewalk, and can only get better as more people add Echo and Ring devices to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7nh3V8"&gt;If community finding features are less important, &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en/pages/products" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chipolo is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t test it in this batch, but it does include separation notifications without an annual fee. Overall, the Tile Pro feels like a good compromise between paying for something more expensive and power-intensive like a cellular tracker, or a more basic, Bluetooth-only tracker. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="title"&gt;The weekend has arrived, bringing with it an assortment of great discounts on everything from student-centric laptops to headphones to some games that launched as recently as this week. We’ve rounded up many of the highlights below, and if you’re looking for the best of the best and not just what’s currently on sale, we’ve also updated our comprehensive guides to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, both of which offer a host of entertainment options for looking to escape the summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HTMrDK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1WW638/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save $15 on TP-Link’s budget-friendly Wi-Fi Extender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4rR6I4"&gt;You don’t necessarily need to opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Wifi system&lt;/a&gt; or a similar mesh network in order to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185759/wi-fi-work-at-home-how-to-router-mesh"&gt;boost your home’s Wi-Fi network&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes a simply Wi-Fi extender like the TP-Link AC750 will do. If you have a &lt;a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/onemesh/product-list/"&gt;compatible router&lt;/a&gt;, the dual-band device will help boost its signal (not increase its speed), helping to alleviate dead zones in your home via a wired or wireless connection. Right now, you can pick TP-Link’s compact extender &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1WW638/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $20&lt;/a&gt;, a $15 discount and its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GgewUp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VtBJGp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=27&amp;amp;imprToken=06bd4661-2452-5d0d-e32&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22334255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The latest Monster Hunter spin-off is already $10 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebCLRg"&gt;The Monster Hunter franchise has seen resurgent in the West in recent years thanks to blockbuster hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the latest Nintendo Switch spin-off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is less about slaying monsters as it is catching them. The turn-based title is vibrant and a bit cliche, but if you’re looking for a &lt;em&gt;MonHun &lt;/em&gt;game with a lighter tone and tried-and-true JRPG mechanics, &lt;em&gt;Wings of Ruin &lt;/em&gt;is already &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $50&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 20 percent of the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3TaN4R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644916"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c89aFO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=32&amp;amp;imprToken=06bd4661-2452-5d0d-e32&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22334255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One of the most budget-friendly gaming mice is even more affordable at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWuIz"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer who wants to make the most of titles like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, a competent gaming mouse is a must-have accessory. Thankfully, the Logitech G502 Hero — the wired counterpart to our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best wireless gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; — is an affordable way to go, with 11 customizable buttons, programmable lighting, and a flexible weight system that allows you to adjust the resistance to your liking on the fly. Typically on sale for around $50, Logitech’s G502 is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $38&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the popular gaming mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8JCRfs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.1430179.html"&gt;Acer’s Swift 3, a laptop suited for summer fun and school, is down to $490 this weekend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Vchu"&gt;The Acer Swift 3 isn’t our No. 1 pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s one of our go-to recommendations for college students given checks all the right boxes. It’s lightweight and performs well for the price, and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.1430179.html"&gt;at Costco&lt;/a&gt;, it’s available with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor for $490. Like all configurations, Costco’s members-only variant also touts an integrated fingerprint reader, a healthy selection of ports, and a backlit keyboard for after-hours work. We admit that the Swift 3’s sturdy, aluminum build won’t win any design competitions, but it’s also a budget laptop that won’t break the bank, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo refuses to say if the OLED Switch fixes Joy-Con drift</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3liC21A-IICAhdzTX58pD5d4PI=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69564804/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTJVOB"&gt;Nintendo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a new model of the Switch this week&lt;/a&gt; that adds an OLED screen, enhanced speakers, and a much-improved kickstand. One thing it seems the OLED Switch won’t bring, however, is a fix for the Joy-Con drift issues that have plagued Switch owners for years — and frustratingly, Nintendo won’t even confirm that it won’t. A variety of publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;tried to ask the question, but Nintendo won’t tackle it head-on, despite other helpful answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;like how the new Switch won’t have a new CPU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWj6Bs"&gt;Switch owners have been reporting Joy-Con drift problems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the problem is bad enough that it’s the subject &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift"&gt;of numerous lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — though Nintendo will unofficially fix controllers experiencing Joy-Con drift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;, even if you’re out of warranty. One of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;top requests for a revised Switch&lt;/a&gt; was a fix for the drift problems, and we hoped that a Switch revision would have been the moment Nintendo finally addressed this major issue. But it seems likely that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4jhef"&gt;In a statement Nintendo provided to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cecianasta/status/1412443261814382595"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22565241/nintendo-switch-new-oled-model-joy-con-drift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oled-nintendo-switch-model-has-the-same-joy-cons-nintendo-confirms/1100-6493614/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company said that the “Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model).” But we didn’t ask about the “configuration” or “functionality,” as it was pretty clear from Nintendo’s announcement that the controllers would be the same. We asked about drift, which is a reliability issue. And when we asked the question again in an even clearer fashion, we were referred to the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XedZYa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reliability, not configuration or functionality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XSrDG"&gt;That seems to suggest there aren’t any changes. An FAQ on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Family/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model-/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model%E2%80%942000984.html"&gt;company’s UK website is even more explicit&lt;/a&gt;: “The Joy-Con controllers included with Nintendo Switch (OLED model) are the same as the controllers currently available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy5WJu"&gt;Nintendo’s statement does acknowledge that there are problems with Joy-Con controllers — “We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly,” Nintendo said — but merely suggested that customers visit its support site to deal with any issues. That language isn’t new; Nintendo issued a very similar statement &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/nintendo-updates-joy-con-drift-policy-will-fix-def/"&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xzzva/internal-nintendo-memo-instructs-customer-service-to-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published an internal Nintendo memo&lt;/a&gt; instructing customer service reps to fix Joy-Con drift issues for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYLR9v"&gt;And Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that “we apologize for any inconvenience experienced by consumers” because of Joy-Con problems &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/qa2006e.pdf"&gt;in an investor Q&amp;amp;A last year&lt;/a&gt;, but added that “I have no information to share about any specific actions we have taken” to fix issues, suggesting his hands were tied because of a class-action lawsuit in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty5pOB"&gt;Until somebody can open up a set of Joy-Cons included with the new Switch, we won’t know for sure that there aren’t any unannounced fixes for the drift issues. But based on what Nintendo has said, I wouldn’t hold your breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdQrSM"&gt;While the OLED Switch may not have been the “Pro” upgrade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;we were hoping for&lt;/a&gt;, the improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;still make a big difference&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Dieter Bohn, who got to try out the new Switch. But if you decide to pick up the $350 console when it launches October 8th, you might want to mentally prepare for the possibility that your new Joy-Cons might end up with the drift issue someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHazQt"&gt;Here’s Nintendo’s full statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T0Hwqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model). The configuration and functionally is the same as that of the Joy-con controllers for the Nintendo Switch console. At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them. We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly. We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__support.nintendo.com&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=Ftw_YSVcGmqQBvrGwAZugGylNRkk-uER0-5bY94tjsc&amp;amp;r=B34I4dJ2bWTOkzssAKywV0DkXMjTumgRTZ1yiaNnNrI&amp;amp;m=4QvkfRn1VuitWeL7Rp7Grf9EQKliv5tf9MSvWb5kkcU&amp;amp;s=rOcfPJLh9r2GqzdUrcaeomr11bHPblC22qpzlS_kMJE&amp;amp;e="&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://support.nintendo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; so we can help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Samsung quietly launched its free TV service on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNHLWIZitvROTDYEV5iRNFvJ1NQ=/0x0:845x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563857/TV_Plus_main1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung TV Plus displayed on a screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyGLdg"&gt;Samsung recently launched a web version of its free and ad-supported Smart TV Plus streaming service for live and linear programming as well as added casting support for Chromecast devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEMhCm"&gt;The streaming product, which was previously limited to Samsung TV and mobile devices, launched as a web service in the second quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"&gt;Protocol reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. It’s a curious new player in the streaming wars and launched with seemingly little fanfare, but the rollout makes an app that was previously limited to Samsung users now widely available to just about anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QSrfb"&gt;Samsung did not have immediate comment about the launch when reached on Friday. However, a spokesperson confirmed the launch of the web version of the service to Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwd1Sp"&gt;Samsung TV Plus has been around for years — it’s been available on Samsung smart TVs since 2016 — but the rollout to additional devices outside of the streaming ecosystem places it more directly in competition with ad-supported streaming services like Peacock, the Roku Channel, or any number of linear-programming freebies like Pluto TV or Plex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpawAd"&gt;While it’s unclear why the company seems to have decided to soft launch the web version of its streaming service now, Samsung appears to be exploring ways to bring TV Plus to a larger audience. Choice is always great and you can’t beat the price of free (particularly if you can stand to sit through ads), but if Samsung’s ambitions are to dominate the linear streaming space, it’s a bit late to the party. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s executive order puts net neutrality back in the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Promoting American Economy Competition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EoIfZBozRlhalpVth7GS_OZRTUI=/0x0:4331x2887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563803/1233894512.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dUIWc"&gt;Earlier today President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy&lt;/a&gt;, and in it there were several provisions relating to net neutrality. The prior administration’s FCC and FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;rolled back Obama-era rules in those areas&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is a clear agenda to restore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6rBq7y"&gt;Directives for the FCC from the order:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0UwQn6"&gt; (i)   adopting through appropriate rulemaking “Net Neutrality” rules similar to those previously adopted under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (Public Law 73-416, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,” 80 Fed. Reg. 19738 (Apr. 13, 2015);            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft4cBs"&gt;(iv)  prohibiting unjust or unreasonable early termination fees for end-user communications contracts, enabling consumers to more easily switch providers;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhB00s"&gt;(v)   initiating a rulemaking that requires broadband service providers to display a broadband consumer label, such as that as described in the Public Notice of the Commission issued on April 4, 2016 (DA 16–357), so as to give consumers clear, concise, and accurate information regarding provider prices and fees, performance, and network practices;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJ0bQ"&gt;(vi)  initiating a rulemaking to require broadband service providers to regularly report broadband price and subscription rates to the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of disseminating that information to the public in a useful manner, to improve price transparency and market functioning; and         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENQir0"&gt;(vii) initiating a rulemaking to prevent landlords and cable and Internet service providers from inhibiting tenants’ choices among providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ooKJes"&gt;The FCC is now tasked with reviving the “Broadband Nutrition Label” that &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2016/04/consumer-broadband-labels-announcement"&gt;was in development in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The label would provide a standardized format for providers to display their price, data allowances and details on performance, similar to the labels you currently see on food at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzkNZ9FT5XPi2IJHO1ZMdcHar_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22709245/Fixed_Consumer_Broadband_Label_Sample_500h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BrC3V"&gt;The FCC has also been asked to start the process of requiring ISPs to regularly report their prices to the FCC to help “improve price transparency and market functioning.” As &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/biden-launches-potential-broadband-regulatory-blitz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multichannel News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, implementing these changes will require adding a third commissioner to the FCC who will vote in favor of these measures, breaking the current 2-2 tie. Current acting FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/acting-chairwoman-rosenworcel-competition-focused-executive-order"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “I welcome this effort by the President to enhance competition in the American economy and in the nation’s communications sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKbsL"&gt;Republican FCC commissioner Brendan Carr would be expected to have a no vote on many of these policies, and &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/commissioner-carr-statement-white-house-executive-order"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that this order “seems to double down on price controls, government-run networks, and monopoly-style regulations—actions that would only make it harder for smaller providers and new entrants to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FutqJz"&gt;While ISPs like Comcast and Verizon have not yet responded to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, cable industry lobbying groups quickly put out their own information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqcGc"&gt;Speaking for a group that represents “small and medium-sized cable operators,” American Communications Association president Matthew Polka chose to largely ignore everything in the order. Instead his statement takes aim at what he sees as a lack of competitive market for another target, studios and broadcast stations, in a statement that &lt;a href="https://acaconnects.org/aca-connects-statement-on-president-bidens-executive-order-on-competition-in-communications-markets/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “Every day our members are unfairly leveraged by large video programmers and broadcast station groups, causing our customers’ video rates to soar...members fear that dominant Internet platforms and powerful streaming services may choose not to make their services available to the subscribers of some smaller ISPs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBKKM4"&gt;The NCTA counts Comcast, WarnerMedia, Disney, Charter and Cox among its members and is ostensibly in favor of an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/positions/open-internet"&gt;open internet&lt;/a&gt;,” as long as no one tries to classify broadband as a utility or passes any rules that would make sure it stays that way. The cable industry group &lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/media/media-room/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; (with no name attached) that says “we are disappointed that the Executive Order rehashes misleading claims about the broadband marketplace, including the tired and disproven assertion that ISPs would block or throttle consumers from accessing the internet content of their choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8b05l"&gt;Similarly, the CTIA represents the interests of its member wireless carriers and is coming out against the order. In its own statement the association &lt;a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-statement-on-july-2021-white-house-executive-order"&gt;is claiming&lt;/a&gt; “the highly regulatory approach outlined in today’s order unfortunately risks harming consumers by distracting from bipartisan efforts to close the digital divide, inhibiting new competitive choices and innovation, jeopardizing new job creation, and needlessly risking our nation’s future technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1eGRg"&gt;On the other side, Free Press VP of policy and general counsel Matt Wood &lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/biden-executive-order-urges-fcc-restore-net-neutrality-and-promote-broadband-competition"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “the FCC needs to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration, which presided over rising prices and declining investment in broadband while pretending that a do-nothing deregulatory approach would solve these problems... When the Trump FCC abandoned the proper legal framework and policies in 2017, people of every political stripe overwhelmingly opposed that repeal. When we finally have a full and functioning FCC dedicated to promoting the public interest again, the agency can get the job done — taking the kinds of steps outlined in today’s executive order and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WAhvOt"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broken Cellphones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egh-aJm5HvcFBkiyM1sh4Ju1yyk=/0x417:5000x3750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563721/1084203064.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOFDJA"&gt;A sweeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424363/ftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; aimed at promoting economic competition and signed Friday by President Joe Biden called on the Federal Trade Commission to institute rules to curb anticompetitive restrictions that limit consumers’ ability to repair gadgets on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh7X5N"&gt;Tucked into the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that covered 72 initiatives to promote competition in the US economy, Biden specifically asked the FTC to crack down on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk3en3"&gt;The order is a significant win for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549129/massachusetts-right-to-repair-question-1-wireless-car-data-passes"&gt;right to repair&lt;/a&gt; advocates who have long championed a consumer’s choice to have their technology fixed either by third parties or on their own, rather than solely by the manufacturer. Right to repair argues that anyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;should have access&lt;/a&gt; to the OEM parts, manuals, and software needed to perform those repairs. Major gadget makers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;have lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to prevent this kind of repair accessibility, but the right to repair movement has been picking up momentum in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aAIJLz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqn7ff"&gt;Specifically, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;took aim&lt;/a&gt; at cell phone makers and other tech companies, including  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;tractor manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tqdiQ"&gt;In a statement, US PIRG’s senior right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ij3n0B"&gt;“More repair choices will protect the environment by cutting down on the amount of new electronics we make and old stuff we toss,” Proctor said. “More choices help save money and cut down-time waiting for the manufacturer’s technician, which is especially important for farmers on tight planting or harvesting schedules. This is a win.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC has reportedly opened an investigation into Amazon’s MGM acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mE5hmAjo_g5WuyFkzoHU8tZwjPI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563710/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5FrTy"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-opens-probe-of-amazons-mgm-purchase-signaling-a-lengthy-inquiry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; describes the probe as an “in-depth investigation into the deal,” which could signal that it will stretch on for many months. The investigation also means the deal will be scrutinized by an FTC newly headed up by Lina Khan, an antitrust advocate and an Amazon critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYcjaf"&gt;The FTC is focused on “the larger implications of the deal for Amazon’s market power,” &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported based on information from two people who knew of the probe, and that “the FTC is wary of whether the deal will illegally boost Amazon’s ability to offer a wide array of goods and services, and is not just limited to content production and distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ct6GPl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was widely expected the deal might get investigated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU53uC"&gt;Amazon announced that it had reached a deal to acquire MGM, the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt; franchise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;for $8.45 billion on May 26th&lt;/a&gt;, but it was widely expected that the merger would receive extra scrutiny from the government. On June 22nd, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-planned-purchase-of-mgm-to-be-reviewed-by-ftc-11624379614"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; had reported&lt;/a&gt; that the investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;was in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and Senator Elizabeth Warren called on the agency to give the deal a “meticulous” review in a letter addressed to Khan and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556369/elizabeth-warren-ftc-review-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfdu5F"&gt;The FTC declined to comment, and Amazon has not replied to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H37hmn"&gt;The probe is the latest signal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;increased antitrust scrutiny from the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;. And Khan has scrutinized Amazon for years, publishing an article titled &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;“Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox”&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt; in 2017 that was popular in progressive economic policy circles. (Amazon is, unsurprisingly, not a fan of Khan, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;has filed a recusal motion&lt;/a&gt; calling for her to restrict herself from proceedings involving Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPd4RW"&gt;Earlier Friday, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; meant to promote competition that targets right to repair rules, net neutrality, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space tourism rivalry gets extremely petty ahead of Branson’s spaceflight </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENxgP0Gg1aT6jQttOQMeH0aqoYw=/0x0:3264x2176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563548/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Richard Branson (left) prepares for his flight to space, the rivalry between his space company Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, owned byJeff Bezos (right) is heating up.&lt;/em&gt; | Left: Bloomberg / Getty Images, Right: Alex Wong / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tj9OHe"&gt;A PR war between two billionaire-owned space companies, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, is starting to get spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRoVVu"&gt;Ever since Virgin announced it’d try to fly its founder Branson to space nine days before Bezos flies on his own rocket, Blue Origin has been on a warpath to discredit Virgin’s suborbital spaceplane, publicly attacking everything from the vehicle’s peak altitude to the size of its windows. Blue Origin’s CEO Bob Smith wished Branson well after Virgin’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, but alleged he’s not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to space — “they’re not flying above the Kármán line and it’s a very different experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIs2KL"&gt;The Kármán line, 62 miles above ground, is the boundary of space recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), a Swiss organization that sets global rules for air sports. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket launches its crew capsule just beyond the Kármán line for a few minutes of weightlessness, while Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane flies 55 miles high — just over the boundary of space defined by the US government. So, both companies say they fly to space, just by different standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zxEZIB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100 km up at the internationally recognized Kármán line. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QRoufBIrUJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QRoufBIrUJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s5YLP6"&gt;Blue Origin tweeted a colorful chart on Friday, two days before Branson’s flight, comparing Virgin Galactic’s spaceplane to Blue Origin’s New Shepard on window size, vehicle type, escape system, and other factors. “From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name,” the company said in its tweet, implying Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo passengers can’t call themselves astronauts. The company continued, suggesting the Kármán line is a legally binding international standard: “For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100 km up at the internationally recognized Kármán line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efYqf8"&gt;Asked where it pulled the 96 percent figure from, a Blue Origin spokesperson clarified in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they subtracted the US population from the world’s population, because the US follows a different standard than the FAI, the Switzerland-based organization. “The US Air Force is the only government agency that has consistently recognized a lower altitude as the boundary of space (80 km / 50 miles),” the spokesperson added. In reality, both NASA and the FAA, a US government agency that licenses Blue Origin launches, also use the same 50-mile standard for recognizing the boundary of space. It’s worth noting that Blue Origin is based in the US and is generally required to follow US spaceflight standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SqNnHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This pissing contest about the Karman line is so childish”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FAPOmE"&gt;Virgin Galactic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Blue Origin’s tweet. But Nicola Pecile, a Virgin Galactic test pilot, hit back, saying in a now-deleted tweet, “this pissing contest about the Karman line is so childish that is getting really embarrassing to watch. Flying above 100K ft is already so complicated that anyone doing so should deserve a special recognition.” In another tweet, he cited Virgin Galactic’s first spaceflight with humans in 2018 and added that Blue Origin “has flown only mannequins so far.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QySnZmBysDLTP849hCW8A8lnfTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22709145/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_5.35.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58aXUC"&gt;The “pissing contest” on Twitter was only the latest fight in a month full of snark and sass between the two billionaire-funded space tourism companies as each gears up to fly their respective billionaire founders to space. Virgin Galactic’s decision to fly Branson on July 11th was widely seen as a PR move to beat Bezos’ launch to space on July 20th. Branson was originally poised to fly on a later flight, likely a few months from now. When Branson was asked on CNBC last week whether he’s trying to beat Bezos to space, he replied: “Jeff who?” (It was the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0871VJfvD1c?t=1007"&gt;same initial response SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gave&lt;/a&gt; when asked a similar question in a 2016 BBC interview.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bnQkp"&gt;Blue Origin’s tweet on Friday reignited online discussion about where the boundary of space should be set. Interpretations vary greatly between fields of study — a meteorologist may argue space begins much lower than where a planetary scientist would set the bar. But for human spaceflight, the US has long maintained that 50 miles is the appropriate altitude for space to begin, and the point where a person can earn their “astronaut wings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="esLUjL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To say that it’s internationally agreed is a bit of a stretch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj3XbH"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer and expert tracker of space objects, argues in a 2018 &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07894"&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt; that space begins at 50 miles above ground, based on physics and roughly the minimum altitude for orbital objects. In a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, McDowell pushed back on Blue Origin’s claim that a vast majority of the world’s population believes space begins at the FAI’s 62-mile marker and that it’s an “internationally recognized” standard. While most space-faring nations might agree with the FAI’s standard, it doesn’t represent a large chunk of the world’s population, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJI9ED"&gt;“A lot of countries don’t have an opinion, a lot of countries have not chosen to rule on it. And international legal bodies, which the FAI is not, have not ruled on it. So to say that it’s internationally agreed is a bit of a stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ US championship will welcome back in-person fans</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D6p8nI"&gt;This year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series (LCS) finale is the latest esports event to welcome an audience to attend in person. Riot Games announced on Friday that the final two matches of the LCS Championship, the league’s postseason summer tournament, will take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on August 28th and 29th, and fans will be able to attend the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSfeJ2"&gt;During the pandemic, the league shifted to an entirely virtual format where players competed online and casters commentated remotely. It has moved slowly toward a return to events with fans. The final two matches of the Midseason Showdown tournament in April brought the players and production crew onstage at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, but there was no audience in attendance. LCS matches for the Summer Split have taken place in the LCS studios, but like with the Midseason Showdown, fans have been absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KKKTaf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh my god, I think we’re gonna be able to do this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRoMHw"&gt;As the vaccine rollout has accelerated around the US in 2021, the league realized they might actually be able to host the LCS Championship at a venue with a live crowd, Chris Greeley, Riot Games’ head of esports for North America and Oceania and the interim LCS commissioner, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We spent a lot of time talking to the folks at the Prudential Center, who were also talking to the state of New Jersey, to get an understanding of what regulations would look like and what the evolving health standards would look like. We got to a point where we all kind of looked around and said, ‘Oh my god, I think we’re gonna be able to do this.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VZjRU"&gt;If you want to attend the LCS Championships, the league is recommending that you are vaccinated against COVID-19 before attending, and says “we’ll post more detailed information regarding health and safety protocols at the Prudential Center as we get closer to the event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qoMbC"&gt;I asked Greeley if there were any contingency plans in place for a worst-case scenario. “There’s no pandemic playbook, so it’s hard to start to put those contingency plans in place because there’s no known set of variables,” he says. “It’s not like, ‘Alright, well if X happens, we’ll do Y’ because you just don’t know. But we’re spending a lot of time talking to the folks at the Prudential Center or on the ground to get an understanding of where they are in terms of local health regulations to make sure that if things do change, we have the ability to shift and pivot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPnHWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The LCS has venues picked out for spring and summer tournaments in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MY9K9W"&gt;Greeley seems optimistic that live events will continue in 2022, teasing that the LCS already has venues picked out for next year’s Midseason Showdown and the LCS Championship. And he reminded me that the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship is set to take place &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/le-mondial%C2%A02020-commence-le-25%C2%A0septembre/blt2237ab89da64fb68"&gt;in North America in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, six years after the previous championship was held in North America in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cmyKX"&gt;Some events in China have welcomed fans sooner than the LCS. While most matches of last year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championships in Shanghai had no in-person audience, more than 6,000 fans &lt;a href="https://esportsobserver.com/lol-worlds-2020-finals-audience/"&gt;were allowed to attend&lt;/a&gt; the final match of the tournament. And the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League’s (OWL) Shanghai Dragons just hosted an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShanghaiDragons/status/1413383367370891266"&gt;in-person event on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n1Xcht"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are you ready?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  LA Valiant&lt;br&gt;⏰ 5am PT, 8pm CST, 9pm KST&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/1TXkH1SS1W"&gt;https://t.co/1TXkH1SS1W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UMmmNqoSal"&gt;https://t.co/UMmmNqoSal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OWL2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OWL2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShanghaiDragons?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ShanghaiDragons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dRyhg1Ekpl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dRyhg1Ekpl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shanghai Dragons (@ShanghaiDragons) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShanghaiDragons/status/1413383367370891266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EHB0a9"&gt;Other organizations have announced news this week about esports events that fans can attend. Valve revealed that The International, one of the biggest tournaments in esports with a more than $40 million prize pool, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;now take place in Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League (CDL) announced details about the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412486745409662977"&gt;Major V tournament&lt;/a&gt;, which starts on July 29th at Esports Stadium Arlington in Texas, and information about the league’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412818756536000512"&gt;championship weekend&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off on August 19th at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="615Aqg"&gt;Speaking of the Esports Stadium Arlington, the venue is hosting the first in-person OWL event in North America in 2021 on Friday. The Dallas Fuel will be playing a match in front of a 50 percent capacity audience, though they’ll be competing online against their opponents, the Houston Outlaws, who won’t be in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iCoyp"&gt;For the CDL and OWL, getting back to live games is important for teams since events are a part of how they make money. Unlike the LCS, where all teams play in the same venue during the regular season (when they aren’t playing remotely due to the pandemic, of course), the CDL and OWL are modeled more like the NBA or NFL, where teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;host events in the area where they’re based&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqEEdI"&gt;Friday’s Dallas Fuel event won’t be an official OWL match, but there’s still a lot to look forward to about bringing people together to watch esports live, Justin Rojas, VP events at Fuel owner Envy Gaming, told me this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xQMJf"&gt;“I’m excited to just see a bunch of people cheering again,” he says. “That is why I do events. To see the look on people’s faces when they are excited and enjoying something you created and made happen. Seeing how that brings people together — no matter how hard the event is, and how much work you put into it — once you see that, it always makes it feel worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
