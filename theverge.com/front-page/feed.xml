    <title>Six things we learned about Elden Ring</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cbtS3__8h9h0FkDeyuE3Smf9P_Y=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783072/ELDENRING_25.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;More details on the collaboration between George R.R Martin and FromSoftware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7apIzv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; is a collaboration between two masters of fantasy: &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; author George R.R Martin and &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; studio FromSoftware, led by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls"&gt;visionary director Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;. With big names like those come equally big expectations, and the game has been hotly anticipated, even as players have seen little of it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18647110/elden-ring-leak-george-rr-martin-from-software-ps4-xbox-e3-2019"&gt;since it was announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;The first gameplay trailer was revealed in June&lt;/a&gt;.) In many ways, it’s a big departure for the studio, with a more traditional story structure and an ambitious open world to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlv7k1"&gt;To get a better sense of what &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; actually is, I recently had the chance to view a hands-off demo and chat with FromSoftware’s Yasuhiro Kitao to learn about its development and philosophy. Here are six things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IC2VMy4PIxS4TLyzSXrIBJleYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808388/ELDENRING_22.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IAvDd0"&gt;The world is huge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDqk9L"&gt;For the first time, FromSoftware is tackling an open world. Called the “Land Between,” &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;’s fantasy realm is a series of dungeons connected by a vast overworld. It’s a big change for the studio — and it involved a lot of iteration and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0kwH5"&gt;“When we first set out, we knew we wanted to create a very large world, and have that interspersed with these legacy dungeons, that sort of structure,” Kitao says. “But we thought the overworld would become a lot more flat and plain, and be there to connect these dungeons. As we built it out, we learned that we wanted the Lands Between to have a lot more character, and a lot more verticality, and more intricate design. So we ended up handcrafting a lot of this map, and trying to make it as interesting to explore as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SDzW1n"&gt;But it won’t be a chore to traverse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gDFLGM"&gt;One of the key tenets of the world design, though, is that the studio didn’t want its scale to be a hindrance. Instead, there are a number of features — such as a &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;-like system where you can drop waypoints on the map — meant to make it easier to manage getting around. Here’s Kitao on some of the other new traversal-related features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="owm3RR"&gt;As we built out the open world, we realized we wanted to alleviate player frustration as much as possible with these large distances involved. We have our existing corpse run system carried over from previous games, but we didn’t want that to be a frustrating or stressful aspect for the player to have to run all the way across the map to collect their experience points. So one thing we did was, in an area with a high level of challenge, we’ve placed these retry points — that’s still a tentative name — and if the player finds that, they’ll have the option when they die of respawning from the retry point or the last checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG1Q70"&gt;Also, by opening the map, the player can fast travel to any previously visited “site of lost grace,” as long as they’re not within a dungeon currently. It just alleviates some of that stress, and having this burden in the back of your mind of having to travel all the way back to where you’ve previously been. It streamlines that a little bit. Of course we’re conscious of the fact that the world is so big, and we wanted it to be filled with interesting discoveries and encounters. And so we’re currently in the middle of fine-tuning that pacing and that tempo of what you run into out in the overworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06iCxV_Zi0TqxJ-aupkRlxTwtkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808411/ELDENRING_21.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TDU8vB"&gt;You get a ghost horse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u7nutk"&gt;Maybe the best part of the open world is that you’ll get a horse, called a spirit steed, to move around quicker. It looks cool and can even accompany you into battle. More importantly — as has been the case in games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16978294/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-remaster-ps4-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — it sounds like you’ll be able to form a connection with your ethereal horse over the course of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5rMan"&gt;“We hope that players can form at least a small bond with the spirit steed,” says Kitao. “It is a unique creature that is inherited by the player, so it is unique to them. You can’t choose or ride any horse in the game. You will be able to do small interactions, such as feeding it to regain its health and small things like this. Hopefully through this the player will be able to form a small attachment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DVSoLi"&gt;George R.R. Martin set the stage, but FromSoftware took it from there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ1l7G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; is billed as a collaboration between Martin and FromSoftware, but the reality sounds slightly less involved than that. Instead of working on the game together simultaneously, Martin got things started by outlining the world and its history, before passing it off to the studio to make the game. Here’s how Kitao explains the working relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FI0wQs"&gt;George R.R. Martin provided us the mythos for the world, which takes place many, many years before the events of the game, and really shapes a lot of the current state of the world and its characters. We think this original mythos that he created really had a lot of influence on our approach to the narrative this time. George R.R. Martin was kind enough to hand that over for us to do what we want with it, and Miyazaki has had a lot of fun playing around with that mythos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwCwB"&gt;We felt it was a really inspiring collaboration. When George R.R. Martin says “Okay, here’s the mythos, do what you will with it,” Miyazaki is just going to run with it. So he’s really taken a lot of inspiration. Miyazaki has really been free to take his own interpretations and create his own characters based off of that. He’s really enjoyed having this script as a backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z1WNSz"&gt;FromSoftware is taking a different approach to storytelling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ddrkyy"&gt;To go along with this, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; appears to be a different — and more traditional — approach to storytelling for FromSoftware. The studio’s past work, from &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, has been defined in part by deep, convincing worlds that required the players to piece things together themselves. But &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a little more like a conventional fantasy story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDBtf7"&gt;“We’ve always tried to make our games approachable and have interesting narratives, but the player has always been getting caught up in something preexisting, and been taken along for a ride,” Kitao says. “This time they have more agency, they have more ambition, and an overarching objective within that fantasy. We feel like this will be very different to our previous titles. Instead of just being a sick foreigner who has come to Yharnam, or an undead warrior who finds himself in a bleak landscape, the player has returned to the Lands Between as a ‘tarnished’ in search of the Elden Ring’s power, to uncover its mysteries. It’s a very simple premise but it helps to drive that mainline story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFIJVhOwHCInA3riLjMH1-orPIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808517/ELDENRING_23.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UT0yGk"&gt;The monsters are terrifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TMe5IQ"&gt;One thing that hasn’t changed: &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; still has the inventive and often horrifying monsters for which From games are known. During a brief gameplay video I witnessed gigantic dragons, a troll that look ripped from &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, an unsettlingly stretchy snake-man, and a boss that looked like a whole bunch of dead bodies smushed together. At one point there was a giant bird with swords in its talons, tossing explosive barrels at the player. According to Kitao, the variety and creativity of From’s creature designs comes in part from the studio’s process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aEurpw"&gt;What tends to happen is Miyazaki will provide some keywords about what sort of creature he wants, and then he’ll give that to the design team. He won’t start with an image. And they’re free to interpret that as they will. That begins this collaboration between Miyazaki and the design team. This doesn’t just apply to the creatures and the monsters, but basically all of the elements of the game, weapons, equipment, characters. It’s a lengthy process, but we think the result is that we get things from each of our artists, working with Miyazaki, to create these things that maybe have not been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAHxyn"&gt;One example is the demigods, the boss characters in the game. The keywords for them were they were “Old heroes from the Lands Between.” So we wanted them to have this heroic and majestic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq1Hfp"&gt;Whenever we have these design discussions, we try to have the game designers and the game planners involved. They’re always able to watch how this design takes shape and how it’s going to be presented in the game. And while the design does take precedence, but you don’t want anything too crazy to break the game. We try to keep everyone involved in the discussion from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SzYcNV"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Elden Ring &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is launching January 21st on a huge range of platforms, including PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter starts launching Ticketed Spaces for some iOS users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eqkw_mmwDLGIdUzKWwEK8MhZYM=/0x0:3849x2566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783046/twittermonetization.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJoh7l"&gt;Twitter is beginning its rollout of Ticketed Spaces, or paid live audio rooms. The company announced yesterday that it’s “experimenting” with the feature for some iOS users. It first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;rolled out applications&lt;/a&gt; to try the product in June with the plan to eventually make it available to all interested iOS and Android users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJBXE"&gt;“Know it’s taking us a little time, but we want to get this right for you,” Twitter wrote in its announcement yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DD99im"&gt;Hosts can charge between $1 and $999 for their ticketed rooms and can also set a room size cap for them. These test group participants will initially keep 97 percent of the money they make, after the fee Apple and Google charge for in-app purchases. But Twitter will increase its cut from 3 percent to 20 percent if a user makes a total of $50,000 across their earnings on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUlmKG"&gt;This fee will also increase when the feature is more widely available. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval"&gt;a preview&lt;/a&gt; of the feature in May, Twitter said hosts would instead keep 80 percent of their revenue, after app store fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVOQQB"&gt;In the months since Twitter announced and previewed Ticketed Spaces, it’s also made changes to how people can find these live audio rooms; they now show up for some users at the top of the mobile Twitter app if someone a user follows is only listening to a space. They used to have to be hosting. (You can hide this activity from your own account through the settings menu.) It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; its API, so third-party apps can point users to Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread’s latest trailer shows off Samus’ new nemesis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="metroid dread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZ1IxJhINrdPtgeAX1H5QjLyRRE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783033/02b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJXikO"&gt;Nintendo debuted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_XnbTayTH4"&gt;a new trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; ahead of its October 8th launch on the Switch. Whereas the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;E3 2021 trailer was claustrophobic&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the E.M.M.I robots that will stalk you throughout the game, this one shows off bigger environments, as well as other enemy types and bosses that you’ll encounter along the way. Notably, Samus goes up against a gigantic living Chozo warrior, one that appears to share a lot in common with Samus in terms of its armor and arsenal. There’s also a boss that looks a bit like Kraid from &lt;em&gt;Super Metroid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKdTkZ"&gt;Additionally, the trailer lets you get a glimpse of some new skills that Samus will pick up during the story. There are familiar ones, like the ability to do Samus’ signature screw attack, getting a speed boost to blow through walls, and collecting the grapple beam. But there are new abilities like flash shift, which lets Samus zip back and forth quickly to catch an enemy off guard, and a storm missile that can lock onto enemies and fire multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF2ynS"&gt;Once you watch the trailer above, &lt;a href="https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/metroid-dread-report-vol-6/"&gt;check out the latest developer update from Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;. It’s full of new clips and screenshots that’ll either make the wait until its October 8th launch a little easier or much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How small developers compete with the defaults on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ap6-Q_uvxQHrLLrBzjjiyRDvqeE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782731/VRG_ILLO_4687_Indie_App_Devs.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are built-in calculator, camera, and to-do apps — but small devs can make them better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U3ptjf"&gt;James Thomson started developing PCalc in 1992 as a way to learn to program for the Mac. Since then, he’s rewritten the calculator app multiple times to feature new UI changes, ported it to the iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, and maintained it for the Mac over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22VzVl"&gt;But PCalc’s popularity — let alone financial success — is an unlikely one. After all, Thomson doesn’t just have to sell customers on the idea of &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; for a calculator app; he has to convince them to spend $10 on his app in a world where Apple already offers its preloaded Calculator app for free on every iPhone and Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz0V92"&gt;Apple bundles each iPhone with over 35 applications, spanning web browsing, email, weather, clock, calendar, camera, music, and virtually every other major part of the phone. It also has a huge home-field advantage for most of its apps, setting them as the default, with no way to change to any other option (something that the company is currently dealing with in a number of antitrust cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSoyYL"&gt;That leaves developers like Thomson in a tough spot, forced to simultaneously work with Apple to be distributed through its App Store, while still trying to outdo Apple’s own default apps with smaller — sometimes even one-person — teams. And yet, despite those challenges, many alternative apps have not only survived, but thrived in the cutthroat world of the App Store. The key is standing out: creating a better, richer experience than the more pared-down default apps provide, by offering apps with more advanced, unique, or different features than Apple’s vanilla alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing three PCalc windows. In the center is a calculator with advanced functions visible." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/461pIo7eJjAQxXQu7HX6yBZ2zR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804663/4.8_Hero_small.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TLA Systems&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCalc for Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tlcoMd"&gt;“I’ve always notionally competed with the built-in apps since day one, so I try not to stress out too much about it,” Thomson says. “Apple has to make relatively straightforward apps that can be easily used by a billion or so people, so there’s a lot of things they can’t or won’t do. You just need to go a bit deeper and build something that will appeal to a smaller number of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfM1II"&gt;It’s a similar strategy taken by popular alternative camera app, Halide, which offers far more advanced features than Apple’s own camera app. Halide co-founder Sebastiaan de With says, “We try to target our products to a market that Apple would be foolish to chase. For example, exposing manual exposure controls would alienate most of their very casual audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="izC5KH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We try to target our products to a market that Apple would be foolish to chase”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWBmUg"&gt;One way to reach an audience, though, is simply by making apps that add the features you yourself were looking for. “When we launched, Halide was a passion project. We were two friends that loved photography and our dream was to make a camera app that was perfect for us,” says de With. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELmcUK"&gt;That logic applies to smaller apps, too. Mustafa Yusuf, the developer of to-do list app Tasks, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he was motivated to create his app because the default iOS Reminders app just didn’t have the features he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2ubiN"&gt;“When I started [developing apps], as a to-do list, it gets really messy very quickly,” Yusuf says. “A feature cannot just be ‘to-do’ and done — there are a lot of steps in between and there was no way for me to do that in an orderly or a neat fashion, so it got really messy really quick, and then I just resorted to pen and paper.” So he created his own app, Tasks, which was built around offering the kinds of sub-tasks and filtering that he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two screenshots of Halide. One shows options for auto exposure, manual exposure, and zebras. The other shows a waveform at the bottom of the viewfinder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRLbIDZL9cl6cIwkVQmJd_18VBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804688/2_Up___Pro_Tools.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lux&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halide includes advanced exposure tools like zebras and waveforms that you can’t get in the default camera app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7H5yKy"&gt;There are also other areas that give the more niche apps an edge. While Apple tends to only update its apps with major features once a year as part of its annual iOS releases, third-party developers can move at a much more rapid pace, adding more features and updates throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmamSx"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple events are carefree. The company is infamous for its history of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;Sherlocking&lt;/a&gt;” features and integrating them into its own apps. “I would be lying if I didn’t hold my breath every time there was a WWDC keynote,” Thomson says, noting the possibility that Apple may one day finally make an iPad calculator app. And de With notes that some Halide features have shown up in Apple’s Camera app later on, like its shutter animation. “It could be great minds thinking alike, or just a nice nod to us. Who knows!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuPa58"&gt;One challenge facing alternative default apps, however, is pricing. The App Store in general has been in a race to the bottom almost since its inception; in 2021, paid apps are a rarity among big names, and the top-grossing apps on the platform are — without exception — free apps with either subscriptions or in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrY8bh"&gt;And for apps like Tasks or Halide, which have to outdo their free alternatives, that’s also meant having to face the reality of subscriptions and free trials. “I cannot imagine having a paywall to even try the app out — if I had that barrier to entry, people just go solo, because there’s just a ton of free alternatives,” says Yusuf. “Forget Apple itself, right, like Google has its own thing, Microsoft has its own thing going on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tasks app on Mac and iPad shows a navigation bar and three columns of to-dos reading “Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.” The iPhone version only shows a single column at a time." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoeUqxIhFQuigPF4ByT68u3lcMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804678/EnrzFk1WMAY_vwG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mustafa Yusuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tasks on an iPad, Mac, and iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoPrPg"&gt;Subscriptions are a double-edged sword, however. They provide developers with recurring, steady revenue that they can rely on — there’s a reason that they’ve increasingly cropped up among apps like Halide, Carrot Weather, and Fantastical, which all aim to offer alternatives to Apple’s default apps. But they’re also a tougher sell to customers, who tend to be saddled with higher costs over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1fafE"&gt;It’s one of the reasons that PCalc still maintains its upfront price, despite experimenting with a free version with in-app purchases a few years ago. “As a developer, I’d really love the recurring income from a subscription model, but I don’t honestly think it’s a great fit for a standalone utility like PCalc that doesn’t have any online infrastructure to maintain,” Thomson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GrRZ0S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even 1 percent of that billion is still a pretty huge market for an indie developer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TsMBUB"&gt;The truth of the matter is, though, that even if things dramatically change on iOS and Apple were to turn around and announce tomorrow that it would offer full access for any app to be set as a default, it seems unlikely that apps like Tasks, Halide, or PCalc will ever approach the popularity of the built-in options. Free is free, and for millions of iPhone customers, the basic apps that come with their phones are enough for the job; good is the enemy of great, especially when “good enough” comes preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hF3X9C"&gt;But the sheer size of platforms like iOS (and Android, which offers slightly more options to developers when it comes to competing with defaults) means that even in the more limited circumstances, there’s still plenty of room for these alternate apps. As Thomson points out, there’s over a billion Apple devices out there. “Even 1 percent of that billion is still a pretty huge market for an indie developer, and you can hopefully find an audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaFeCr"&gt;And if the day comes when Apple relents and gives developers the chance to set their apps as defaults and face its own even more head-on (as has already happened with services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301478/apple-ios-14-default-apps-browser-email-changes-features-report"&gt;email and web browsers in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;), at least some developers will leap at the chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3IMPga"&gt;“Yes. A million times yes,” says de With to the idea of making Halide a default. “If it were an option on the table, we would jump through whatever hoops necessary — even if that means adjusting our app for these new considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The most popular posts on Facebook are plagiarized</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-nL8PAIMlMKuVN1SFrHlgfuw9cA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782614/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Being original on Facebook doesn’t pay, according to its own data  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gKMx5S"&gt;The conventional wisdom around the “&lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report"&gt;widely viewed content report&lt;/a&gt;” that Facebook released last week is that it obscured more than it revealed. The company’s effort to demonstrate that most users do not regularly see divisive news stories in their feeds received widespread criticism for offering only the highest-level view of the data possible. The most-shared domain on Facebook is YouTube.com? Great, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW9Eps"&gt;But in recent days, I’ve spent more time looking at the data Facebook actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; share. And while it’s true that it tells us little about hot-button issues like the spread of COVID-19 misinformation or the rise of vaccine hesitancy, the report arguably reveals something just as damning: almost all of the most-viewed posts on Facebook over the past quarter were effectively plagiarized from elsewhere. And some of the same audience-building tactics that allowed Russian interference to flourish on the platform in 2016 continue to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE5syk"&gt;Today, I want to look at two aspects of the data. First, we’ll look at the most-viewed posts on Facebook over the past quarter to see where they originally came from. Second, we’ll look at one of the most popular links on the platform, which may be running a grift on US military veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hpd7hk"&gt;
&lt;p id="pLQIWd"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a good idea for a viral social media post. Which is probably why most of Facebook’s most popular pages spent the last quarter stealing their ideas from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPnEPH"&gt;Facebook’s report details &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/#widely-viewed-posts"&gt;the top 20 most widely viewed posts&lt;/a&gt; on the network over the past three months. One of the posts was deleted before Facebook published it. Of the remaining 19, though, only four appear to have been original. The remaining 15 had been published in at least one other place first, and were then re-uploaded to Facebook, sometimes with small changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwftew"&gt;Take the No. 1 post in the report, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/1885066628300379"&gt;a meme&lt;/a&gt; from the motivational speaker and author Gaur Gopal Das. It’s a jumble of letters and words underneath the message “First three words u see are your reality.” It was originally posted more than a year ago, but continues to rack up views: 80.6 million people have seen it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGzOPC"&gt;But it wasn’t original to Das. The meme had been posted to Twitter&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/manifestive/status/1281143886493159425"&gt; two weeks earlier by the Ghanaian rapper M.anifest&lt;/a&gt;. (It may not have been original to M.anifest, either; the image he posted looks fairly distressed, as if it had been copied and re-copied many times. His tweet is the earliest instance of the meme I could find using Google’s reverse-image search, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J0zklg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The way to succeed on Facebook is by copying someone else’s idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBB7Gs"&gt;How about No. 2? In April, musician Ace Gutta &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1705381852983290&amp;amp;id=213395992181891"&gt;posted an image&lt;/a&gt; reading “I’m old But I look Young Challenge. Drop a pic 30 and up,” along with a link to his Instagram. More than 61 million people saw it, and 5 million replied. But other people had been issuing this “challenge” all over Facebook in 2020, according to a search I did — here’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1331915943807752&amp;amp;id=100009680774758"&gt;a post from one user last October.&lt;/a&gt; Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ken937/posts/im-old-but-look-young-challenge-drop-a-pic/536596960319439/"&gt;another one from March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzjhgx"&gt;Next up: in May, the Facebook page for Texas’ hottest morning show, &lt;em&gt;Daytime with Kimberly &amp;amp; Esteban&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watchdaytime/posts/1420970424928556"&gt;dared to ask&lt;/a&gt;: “What is something you will never eat, no matter how hungry you get?” 58.6 million people were confronted with this question, and 2.7 million of them replied. Versions of this question have been floating around &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bigman_xander/status/1214245144452571136?lang=en"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and meme pages for &lt;a href="https://za.toluna.com/opinions/4912436/Name-A-Food-You-Would-Never-Eat-No-Matter-How-Hungry-You-Are"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5MYYj"&gt;No. 5 found “wife, mom, author” Christina Watts &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChristinaMWatts330/posts/3038476513048854"&gt;starting a fight&lt;/a&gt; over whether sugar belongs on spaghetti that was visited upon 58.6 million souls; the comedian Steve Harvey had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAmSteveHarvey/status/1382388050794205186"&gt;tweeted the same question&lt;/a&gt; less than a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t8ZBS"&gt;It takes until the sixth post until we find something vaguely original — a message from President Biden that got 52.8 million views. He appears to have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1387800729281236997?lang=en"&gt;cross-posted the message from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, just like his predecessor did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXIFvN"&gt;It more or less goes on like this for the rest of the top 20: lots of viral questions stolen from Reddit, Quora, Twitter or other sites, rewarded with huge engagement on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBrSb7"&gt;Maybe at this point you’re rolling your eyes. So some dumb meme pages stole memes from other dumb meme pages — what’s the big deal? And I’ll allow that the Facebook pages of Texas-based daytime talk shows typically do not observe the zero-tolerance policy on plagiarism that journalists do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kb7YZ6"&gt;Moreover, Facebook has long been home to reappropriated content, from the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/not-so-freebooting/"&gt;freebooting scandal&lt;/a&gt; during 2017’s pivot to video to the more recent phenomenon of Instagram’s Reels being flooded with videos bearing TikTok watermarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5zCK7"&gt;But this kind of dumb, cheap growth hacking should sound familiar to anyone who paid even passing attention to the 2016 election. Russia’s infamous Internet Research Agency commissioned a troll army to build up big followings on innocuous-seeming Facebook pages using a wide variety of engagement bait, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-propaganda-senate-report/"&gt;then gradually shifted those pages to begin sharing more divisive political memes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLUXQv"&gt;That’s all much harder to do now, thanks to a variety of measures Facebook has taken to make it more difficult for people to disguise their identities or countries of origin. The company now routinely removes networks of pages where the creators’ identities are suspect. And it’s worth saying that in the most recent election, inauthentic behavior of the 2016 variety did not play a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51n6Tl"&gt;Most importantly, Facebook now has a policy against “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Inauthentic-Behavior-Report-October-2020.pdf"&gt;abusive audience building&lt;/a&gt;” — switching topics and repeatedly changing a page’s name for the purpose of growing a following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41d1k"&gt;But it seems notable that for domestic actors, the tactics not only work, but remain the most effective way to reach a large audience five years later. Steal some questions that went viral somewhere else, spam them on your page, and presto: you’re one of the most-viewed links for the entire quarter on the world’s biggest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1q9mYf"&gt;I talked about all this with the company today, and it said that re-posting content from elsewhere does not violate its policies. (Among other things, it would likely be extremely difficult to police.) In order for Facebook to remove posts like these, the company said, there has to be something deceptive about them: lying about who posted them, or where they live, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YalQuV"&gt;Facebook has come a long way in removing inauthentic people from the platform. But what I would consider inauthentic content dominates the most-viewed posts on the site. In the short term, these posts may prove to be less harmful than the COVID misinformation and Big Lie rabble-rousing that we get worked up about more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3iDRZ"&gt;Over the long term, though, they would seem to provide a motivated adversary with a broad attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wL3tfi"&gt;
&lt;p id="dGDKto"&gt;There’s something else in the data that bothers me — something that hints at some of the darker forces in the ecosystem. The plagiarists who dominate Facebook’s top 20 links are likely doing it primarily for clout and ill-gotten audience growth. But some of the other characters here appear to have more direct monetary incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OadgGU"&gt;Ever since Facebook’s report came out, commentators have noted the large number of spam networks present in the list of most viewed links. (This is separate from the list of most viewed &lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt; described above; the links list includes cumulative views for a link across Facebook; the former list counts only views for an individual post.) Most memorably, the researcher Ethan Zuckerman &lt;a href="https://ethanzuckerman.com/2021/08/18/facebooks-new-transparency-report-is-really-strange/"&gt;explored the origins of the No. 9 link on Facebook’s list&lt;/a&gt;, a speaking agency of former Green Bay Packers players that got 87 million views thanks to players adding the link to low-effort meme posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWEcUy"&gt;My eyes were drawn to the 15th-most viewed link, which leads to an online storefront selling a Vietnam memorial flag. (“Normally, $24.00. But because you are a hero, all you need to pay is $20.00 and you can have a collectors Item.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlgQCr"&gt;The links are promoted via an endless series of memes posted every few hours to Facebook pages marketed to veterans. You’ll find it on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/waronterrorveterans/"&gt;the “Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans” page&lt;/a&gt; and, more logically, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/vetsofvietnam"&gt;the Vietnam Veterans page&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/desertstormvets/"&gt;the Desert Storm Veterans&lt;/a&gt; page links to the same online storefront, selling a Desert Storm memorial flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzAXdy"&gt;Together, they have more than 350,000 followers. And their link got 37 million views over three months. Who runs these pages? Are they veterans? The pages bear no clues, and the administrators did not respond to messages from me today. (One of them did see my message, though, according to Facebook Messenger.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1sebR"&gt;But they looked familiar to Kristofer Goldsmith, who has spent &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/17/popular-facebook-page-vets-trump-seemed-be-place-former-military-months-macedonians-controlled-it/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; investigating the way bad actors will pose as members of military communities to run various grifts and influence operations. In fact, he said, he had previously reported the network to Facebook. Among other things, he said, networks like this often steal plagiarize memes from authentic military communities to hawk merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aDKpak"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“profiting off the death and suffering of service members”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Att5ZB"&gt;“It’s profiting off the death and suffering of service members,” said Goldsmith, a former investigator for Vietnam Veterans of America who now runs an open-source intelligence service named Sparverius. (It’s named after the American kestrel — “the smallest predatory bird in the Western hemisphere,” Goldsmith told me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ick6nN"&gt;Goldsmith said that Facebook had been slow to intervene in cases where page owners misrepresented themselves as veterans in order to sell merchandise to members of military families. “As someone who has been trying to help Facebook understand that this is harmful to my community for three, going on four years now, I’m beyond upset that I still have to do this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNH5yO"&gt;Facebook told me it would look into the network. It noted that it is often difficult to discern a page owner’s intent from the content posted, and in the absence of evidence of deceptive content, it can be hesitant to act. People have different opinions on what counts as “spam”; the dividing line isn’t always clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnTaQH"&gt;At the same time, the network of pages here seems purpose-built to evade spam detection. By posting heart-rending memes targeted at service members and their families, they’ve made it much less likely that the memes will get reported as spam, even as they post the link to the same cheap flag every single hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hDl1w"&gt;Whatever the case, Facebook’s list of popular posts and links tell the same story: the way to succeed on the platform is by copying someone else’s idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwmrGP"&gt;And if you’ve studied the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/ljosmyndun/10-times-facebook-copied-a-competitor-bda61d2d5c06"&gt;history of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps that won’t come as much of a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="z1n0jE"&gt;
&lt;p id="a6VQY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="655Nyt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r0iCH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: ‘Bezos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="spacex dragon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LupGikDJWurXjdAFMiJN791b25Q=/0x24:560x397/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782406/20120316-dragonrider.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbgL0p"&gt;Elon Musk has criticized fellow centibillionaire and space cowboy Jeff Bezos for filing lawsuits against the former’s aerospace company SpaceX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRVbJO"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin sued NASA&lt;/a&gt; after it lost a critical government contract to put astronauts on the Moon to SpaceX. This has had the effect of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632990/spacex-lunar-lander-contract-paused-blue-origin-nasa-lawsuit"&gt;delaying SpaceX’s own work on the project&lt;/a&gt;. And now, this week, Amazon has &lt;a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-444868&amp;amp;f_number=SATLOA2020052600055"&gt;urged the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) to dismiss newly-submitted plans by SpaceX to launch another cluster of satellites to power its satellite internet service Starlink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MPeMB"&gt;Replying to a story about the latter complaint, Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1431126154195443714"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3ScwVdxLhYmuAi5OLj5vJlnhZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808830/Screen_Shot_2021_08_27_at_9.33.11_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="brKNFb"&gt;The recent complaint from Amazon doesn’t seem to be a formal lawsuit but rather a letter of protest. And, technically, it’s not that Amazon doesn’t want SpaceX to launch more Starlink satellites at all, but that it thinks the company should be clearer in its plans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtVfc5"&gt;Starlink is currently powered by around 1,740 low earth orbit satellites, which serve an estimated 90,000 customers. SpaceX is gearing up to launch a tranche of 30,000 second-generation satellites to improve the service, and so has to inform the FCC exactly where they will be positioned around the Earth. Amazon’s complaint is that SpaceX is asking the FCC to approve two entirely different orbital configurations to be chosen between later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKU1Ij"&gt;“SpaceX’s novel approach of applying for two mutually exclusive configurations is at odds with both the Commission’s rules and public policy and we urge the Commission to dismiss this amendment,” writes Mariah Dodson Shuman, corporate counsel for Amazon subsidiary Kuiper Systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysbOAO"&gt;Shuman says that having to grapple with two possible configurations “doubles the technical effort” faced by other operators — including Amazon’s Kuiper System, which has yet to launch any satellites of its own. These parties will have to review “interference and orbital debris concerns” raised by two separate satellite configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZgjwr"&gt;Shuman’s preference is that SpaceX should pick a plan and stick with it, and that approving two configurations sets a bad precedent by allowing future satellite operators to hedge their bets while creating more work for the entire industry. She concludes: “Accordingly, the Commission should enforce its rules, dismiss SpaceX’s Amendment, and invite SpaceX to resubmit its amendment after settling on a single configuration for its Gen2 System.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another day, another major Microsoft vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1yCiA2"&gt;Microsoft has warned thousands of its Azure cloud computing customers, including many Fortune 500 companies, about a vulnerability that left their data completely exposed for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrYwXY"&gt;A flaw in Microsoft’s Azure Cosmos DB database product left more than 3,300 Azure customers open to complete unrestricted access by attackers. The vulnerability was introduced in 2019 when Microsoft added a data visualization feature called Jupyter Notebook to Cosmos DB. The feature was turned on by default for all Cosmos DBs in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0PgOi"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://gotcosmos.com/about/customers"&gt;listing of Azure Cosmos DB clients&lt;/a&gt; includes companies like Coca Cola, Liberty Mutual Insurance, ExxonMobil, and Walgreens, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7bdljg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4R8CqW"&gt;“This is the worst cloud vulnerability you can imagine,” said Ami Luttwak, Chief Technology Officer of Wiz, the security company that &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases"&gt;discovered the issue&lt;/a&gt;. “This is the central database of Azure, and we were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfJ84n"&gt;Despite the severity and risk presented, Microsoft hasn’t seen any evidence of the vulnerability leading to illicit data access. “There is no evidence of this technique being exploited by malicious actors,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/microsoft-cloud-databases-vulnerable-for-years-researchers-say?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Microsoft told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an emailed statement. “We are not aware of any customer data being accessed because of this vulnerability.” Microsoft paid Wiz $40,000 for the discovery, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szIXEk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases"&gt;detailed blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Wiz says that the vulnerability introduced by Jupyter Notebook allowed the company’s researchers to gain access to the primary keys that secured the Cosmos DB databases for Microsoft customers. With said keys, Wiz had full read / write / delete access to the data of several thousand Microsoft Azure customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeMK80"&gt;Wiz says that it discovered the issue two weeks ago and Microsoft disabled the vulnerability within 48 hours of Wiz reporting it. However, Microsoft can’t change its customers’ primary access keys, which is why the company emailed Cosmos DB customers to manually change their keys in order to mitigate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrOIpC"&gt;Today’s issue is just the latest security nightmare for Microsoft. The company had some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208401/microsoft-solarwinds-source-code-russian-hackers"&gt;source code stolen by SolarWinds hackers&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;Exchange email servers were breached&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;implicated in ransomware attacks&lt;/a&gt; in March, and a recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560435/microsoft-printnightmare-windows-print-spooler-service-vulnerability-exploit-0-day"&gt;printer flaw&lt;/a&gt; allowed attackers to take over computers with system-level privileges. But with the world’s data increasingly moving to centralized cloud services like Azure, today’s revelation could be the most troubling development yet for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No More Heroes 3 is as stylish and shoddy as ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCT4EtohdFkRoAJ5XMWJ_KdqhAo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782076/07_Action1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Nq1Vs"&gt;I was having a good time with &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; until I somehow lost my save file. I don’t think it was the game’s fault, but unfortunately since it’s coming out today for the Nintendo Switch, I wasn’t able to finish it in time for a full review. I did get several hours into it, though, and it was already feeling like a worthy followup to the Wii original, which I was a big fan of back in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky3e7Q"&gt;Developed by Grasshopper Manufacture, there wasn’t anything quite like the original &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, an action game that saw video game nerd protagonist Travis Touchdown climb the ranks of the world’s deadliest assassins through a series of increasingly ridiculous boss fights. The game also featured an open-world structure where you had to perform menial tasks like pumping gas in order to earn enough money to register for the battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DZPIp"&gt;2010 sequel &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle&lt;/em&gt; dispensed with the open world, opting instead for a more traditional action game structure. But &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; returns to the original game’s design, a change that makes it feel like a true follow-up — for better and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGtZsmZFI7kEybL3M869kFzMU38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808585/02_Boss2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NyEzCl"&gt;Before you get to hit the streets on your Akira-esque bike, you’ll need to play through &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt;’s opening moments, which set the scene in typically bombastic fashion. Rather than mere assassins, this time you’re taking on a league of alien superheroes that makes up the posse behind a powerful CEO and a Thanos-like supervillain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LiShJl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its technical performance is as varied as its influences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TQC8Nd"&gt;Suffice it to say that &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly stylish. The aesthetic is like grindhouse theater meets ‘80s arcade, with deliberately grungey, low-res elements clashing with a pixelated neon UI; the opening moments of this game are like nothing you’ve ever seen. The game often feels like an extended running joke, satirizing everything from &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; to the “next episode” button on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIPZmk"&gt;Unfortunately, and in keeping with the original game, its technical performance is as varied as its influences. Combat in &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; looks and feels great — it runs at 60fps and has a satisfying crunch to it, with or without the recommended Wii-style motion controls. (I played much of the game just fine with buttons and sticks on a Switch Lite, although it’s more convenient to recharge your lightsaber-style weapon by shaking a Joy-Con.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkXAHXIS1rCzG3tGcoRA-7PWiIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808586/06_Slash4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTWo1k"&gt;But once you’re outside of combat, the game gets much less smooth, and performance in the open world falls off a cliff. &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; can’t hold anywhere near a solid 30fps when you’re driving your bike around the city — the constant hitches and judders honestly made me feel a little nauseous at points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2eWyh"&gt;Director Goichi Suda pledged in the video embedded above to “deliver solid and stable performance,” so maybe a future update will improve the situation, because that was certainly not my experience. It was enough to make me wonder why Grasshopper wanted to include the open world in the first place. We’re not exactly talking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; here; this is a barren environment with very little to do. You’re mostly just grinding missions for cash to get to the next boss fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpp8dw"&gt;Still, I’m going to start &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; again from scratch, which should say something about how entertaining I found the chunk I did manage to play. The technical issues don’t obscure the sheer passion and energy that have clearly been poured into this project, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319867/deadly-premonition-2-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;unlike, say, &lt;em&gt;Deadly Premonition 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of the game does actually play well. As with the original &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, if the strong combat and unique sense of style click with you, it’s worth powering through the open-world drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VMILQ"&gt;&lt;small&gt;No More Heroes 3 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available today for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement changes a key App Store rule for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIws0cqrESJtDaW4vTXq-uP4JDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69781576/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61502r"&gt;A proposed agreement between Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652460/apple-class-action-lawsuit-monopoly-app-store"&gt;a class-action lawsuit representing US app developers&lt;/a&gt; includes a $100 million payout from Apple. The &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; also has Apple “clarifying” its policies to explain that iOS developers can contact their customers, with permission, using information collected inside their apps to tell them about payment options outside the App Store. The change is a shift to the anti-steering policy that has been a big point of contention between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple and its critics for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TmUqp"&gt;The change, while potentially important for developers, isn’t quite as significant as it may seem. In an update to the App Store Guidelines in June, Apple already changed its rules to allow developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;to communicate with customers outside of their apps&lt;/a&gt;, but at that time, they weren’t allowed to contact users about alternate payment options using information obtained inside the app — they would have had to figure out how to obtain their contact info another way. If this proposed agreement is approved, that restriction would no longer be in place, which should make it easier for developers to reach out to users. Still, it’s not what many developers have been asking for: a way to let users know, &lt;em&gt;inside their app, &lt;/em&gt;that they don’t have to pay using Apple’s in-app payment system and incur its up-to-30-percent toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XFgjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The proposed $100 million payout would be split by developers who made less than $1 million per year from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRkq9"&gt;Apple’s press release spins the entire settlement as a generous offer to developers, including the anti-steering change: “To give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,” &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/"&gt;the company writes&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Store. Users must consent to the communication and have the right to opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiPlG1"&gt;The company is also making a number of other concessions as part of the proposed agreement for &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15721902/cameron-v-apple-inc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron et al v. Apple Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the big one being a payout of $100 million, which will be split among small developers who earned $1 million or less “for all of their apps in every calendar year in which the developers had an account between June 4, 2015, and April 26, 2021.” Apple has decided to name this the “Small Developer Assistance Fund.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99SSei"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.smallappdeveloperassistance.com/"&gt;website for eligible developers&lt;/a&gt; isn’t fully operational yet (and may not be until the settlement is approved by a judge), but court filings show how the money could be distributed. A proceeds tier ranging from one penny to over $1 million sorts out the potential return, with developers in line for a minimum payment of between $250 and $30,000. That will vary depending on how many people submit approved claims, with leftover funds going to the Girls Who Code nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ciylng"&gt;One of the lawsuit’s named plaintiffs, Richard Czeslawski, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “...we’ve gained the ability to use contact information obtained from signups in our app to communicate with our users outside the app about purchasing alternatives to IAP. That’s a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMS3GM"&gt;Other points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MxAvSc"&gt;A promise to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows developers who earn less than $1 million in a year to apply for a reduced 15 percent commission from their sales, in place in its “current structure” for at least the next three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbCuwt"&gt;The company will publish an annual transparency report about the App Store. Apple says the report will include “meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.” It’s unclear when the first report will be released, but the company is committing to releasing the report for at least three years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4NMX3q"&gt;Developers will be able to set more than 500 price points for subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paid apps. Right now, they’re limited to fewer than 100, so the jump will allow developers to offer a wider range of prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLFgtE"&gt;Apple is committing to keeping the current App Store Search system in place “for at least the next three years.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1431058415263039488?s=21"&gt;Tapbots developer Paul Haddad points out why&lt;/a&gt; that’s not necessarily what all developers want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHR0UR"&gt;The company will add an unspecified amount and type of additional information about the app appeals process &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"&gt;to the App Review website&lt;/a&gt; to “help developers understand how the appeals process works.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PqSZj7"&gt;The proposed changes come on the heels of another big App Store change announced Thursday: Apple announced that it will take a 15 percent cut of publishers’ in-app purchases and subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;if they join Apple News&lt;/a&gt; instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwJklZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 26th, 9:46 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified how, specifically, the anti-steering rule has changed from previously, and other tweaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hacker claims responsibility for T-Mobile attack, bashes the carrier’s security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXBsKWjydj1cjknGWtEqYLTyrtc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780942/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiK1Qi"&gt;A person claiming to be behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;T-Mobile data breach&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;exposed almost 50 million people’s info&lt;/a&gt; has come forward to reveal his identity and to criticize T-Mobile’s security, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. John Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;that he was behind the attack and provided evidence that he could access accounts associated with it, and he went into detail about how he was able to pull it off and why he did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiPTSg"&gt;According to Binns, he was able to get customer (and former customer) data from T-Mobile by scanning for unprotected routers. He found one, he told the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed him to access a Washington state data center that stored credentials for over 100 servers. He called the carrier’s security “awful” and said that realizing how much data he had access to made him panic. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, it’s unclear whether Binns was working alone, though he implied that he collaborated with others for at least part of the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWKVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRnna"&gt;The information the hacker gained access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;includes sensitive personal data&lt;/a&gt;, like names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers, as well as important cellular data like identification numbers for cellphones and SIM cards. T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F26%2F22643277%2Ft-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “confident” that it’s “closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXOl4y"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; goes in depth into Binns’ history as a hacker. He claims that he got his start making cheats for popular video games and that he discovered the flaw that ended up being used in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/satori-iot-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty/"&gt;botnet that attacked IoT devices&lt;/a&gt; (though he denies actually working on the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vX0k93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns describes a troubled relationship with US intelligence services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEbWj5"&gt;According to Binns, his relationship with US intelligence services is troubled, to say the least. A lawsuit that appears to have been filed by Binns in 2020 demands that the CIA, FBI, DOJ, and other agencies tell him what information they have on him. The lawsuit also accuses the government of, among other things, having an informant try to convince Binns to buy Stinger missiles on an FBI-owned website, attacking Binns with psychic and energy weapons, and even with being involved in his alleged kidnapping and torture. An FBI response to his lawsuit denied he was being investigated by the bureau for the botnet or having information related to the alleged surveillance, and abduction, and torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4ArHL"&gt;Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that one of his goals behind the attack was to “generate noise,” saying that he hopes someone in the FBI will leak information related to his alleged kidnapping. It’s not likely that Binns’ situation will be improved now that he’s shone a spotlight on himself as the person who hacked one of the US’s major carriers. However, if his reports about how he gained access to a vast trove of T-Mobile data are true, it paints a concerning picture of the carrier’s security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
