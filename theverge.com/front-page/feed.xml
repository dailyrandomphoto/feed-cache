    <title>A doctor’s quest for more organ emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Emoji for the anatomical heart on the left and the lungs on the right, on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIwye7bLxS6jjsbBrRvxY3nmbNU=/54x0:881x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852736/ios_anatomical_heart_lungs_new_emoji_2020.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The anatomical heart and lungs emoji, as seen on iOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple/&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/first-look-new-emojis-coming-to-ios-in-2020/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UtMekI"&gt;The medical world needs more emoji, according to Shuhan He, an emergency medicine physician who &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/04/metro/this-mass-general-doctor-helped-get-two-new-medical-emojis-approved/"&gt;helped propose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the anatomical heart and lungs emoji. Now,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He and others have laid out the case for an even larger variety of health-related emoji, which they argue could improve communication between doctors and patients.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atsvvA"&gt;In recent years, emoji related to medicine and health — like stethoscopes, hearing aids, bones, and microbes — have made their way into the Unicode Standard. In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783847"&gt;commentary published&lt;/a&gt; last week in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, He and his co-authors hope Unicode will approve more emoji that could be used in medical contexts, including emoji for more organs, like the stomach, liver, and intestines, and equipment like an IV bag, CT scan, and pill pack. He also wants more medical professionals to push for such emoji and to establish a standard for emoji usage in medical communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XhIlr"&gt;“We know in medicine that when patients say specific words, that they tend to highly correlate with specific pathology,” says He. People often describe crushing chest pain, for example, as feeling like an elephant is sitting on their chest. “We also consistently always ask people, what is your&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pain like: sharp, stabbing, dull, or fiery? Those are all emoji that can be represented in pictorial form rather than verbal communication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D1fDju"&gt;&lt;q&gt;elephant emoji, heart emoji&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1hqa"&gt;Emoji-like images are already widely used in medical settings, He says. The Wong-Baker pain scale shows a smiley face at one end and a grimacing or crying face at the other to signify pain levels. That scale was initially developed for children but is now used in many doctors’ offices and hospitals for patients of all ages. If smiley faces are already a part of medical communication, why not also leverage the visual language that’s standardized across people’s phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilRzFJ"&gt;He sees a range of uses for emoji in medicine. Patients who can’t speak or don’t know English could use emoji to describe their symptoms. For patients who do speak English but don’t have much health literacy, a common, standardized visual language could make it easier for them to understand and follow treatment instructions. The rise of telehealth also provides more opportunities for medical staff to supplement their communications with visuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMfw4g"&gt;Jennifer 8. Lee, one of He’s co-authors, is a co-founder of &lt;a href="http://www.emojination.org"&gt;Emojination&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that advocates for more inclusive and representative emoji. Emojination has helped proposals for a number of emoji make it through Unicode’s submission process, including medical emoji like the stethoscope, blood drop, X-ray, and adhesive bandage. (The fight for the blood drop emoji, initially proposed as a menstruation symbol, is included in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18514833/picture-character-emoji-documentary-movie-unicode-tribeca"&gt;documentary about emoji creation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqofne"&gt;“The use of emoji in medicine is really interesting, precisely because in many cases we’re dealing with sort of high stakes, and also very strong cultural practices,” says Lee. “So the more we can move into a curated universal visual medium, the better it can be in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ncokwf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s tricky to get more organs in the mix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRUPhv"&gt;Lee is also a vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee. She thinks there’s value in adding more major organ emoji, but she suspects she’s in the minority on that position. Though the brain, anatomical heart, and lungs emoji were all approved, it’s tricky to get other organs in the mix because they’re not necessarily as recognizable and don’t have as much demand, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqo0m"&gt;If medical organizations established a set of important potential emoji and pushed for them to be added, they might have more luck. “I would guess if the industry as a whole, the professional organizations, cared, they could move the needle,” says Lee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLqGu"&gt;Though a few other doctors have expressed desires for more relevant emoji, we don’t know yet how much traction He’s proposal will pick up. There’d likely need to be more studies around patient’s perceptions of emoji before medical associations throw their weight behind any formal efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cz3EW"&gt;It might not seem like emoji should be a big priority in the medical field, but He thinks anything that improves communication between doctors and patients is worthwhile. Being a doctor “means to listen, to hear their pain and hear their struggle, and to hear exactly what they’re trying to go through, and to help them,” He says. “If we can’t communicate, then we can’t be good doctors. And so this is at the very heart of being a good doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 may be released on October 4th </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MiOk6PdqLVJjXTWY02vx1m3jnPg=/0x0:620x413/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852678/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03WtKl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; may be released on October 4th, according to an internal document &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-stable-release-date-rumor/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The next version of Google’s mobile operating system features the new Material You visual design and has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;in public beta since May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTUPH"&gt;The document is used by Google to inform OEM partners when it will stop approving software builds for the various versions of Android (which it does for every software update to maintain compatibility with Google Mobile Services), according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;. October 4th is the date Google lists as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) release of Android 12 in the document. &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman notes that these AOSP release dates typically fall on the same day as the launch of a stable release of Android 12 for customers. You can see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1437085889885310976?s=20"&gt;Rahman’s tweet&lt;/a&gt; containing a screenshot of the document below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGdNQf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Android 12 stable update may be released on October 4, as that's when Google plans to release to AOSP. This tentative release date was also mentioned by a 3PL. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PMN802gQj0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PMN802gQj0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1437085889885310976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaYMWd"&gt;There’s an easy way to lend credence to that October 4th date: compare the release dates of Android 11 and Android 10 to what the document contains. The stable version of Android 10 was released out of beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20842507/google-android-10-q-pixel-release-download-availability"&gt;on September 3rd, 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just like the document lists. September 8th, 2020, the day Google says was the AOSP release of Android 11, was also the same day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427153/android-11-official-launch-google-pixel-oneplus-8-xiaomi-oppo-realme-update"&gt;the software was released to the public&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not hard confirmation, but it does make October 4th, 2021 seem a lot more likely as an Android 12 release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qou1Kx"&gt;Targeting some date in October would also put Android 12 in the general ballpark of when Google is expected to finally announce (as in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;stop teasing&lt;/a&gt; and actually detail) the Pixel 6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;Rumors spun out of Google’s own marketing&lt;/a&gt; target October 19th for the launch of Google’s flagship. Starting the rollout of Android 12 a couple of weeks before certainly seems like a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden to nominate facial recognition critic to FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4J044MXXWLlF9TWLVS7i2Nx37g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852385/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dmguuC"&gt;President Joe Biden is expected to nominate privacy hawk Alvaro Bedoya to the Federal Trade Commission, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-to-tap-privacy-hawk-for-ftc-post-928e807e-14f0-49ba-9585-50c9df171a04.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmhSOl"&gt;Bedoya is a professor at Georgetown University’s law school, focusing on privacy law. If confirmed, he would replace current Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who was nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year. In 2014, Bedoya founded Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology. He also served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law under the chairmanship of Sen. Al Franken (D-MN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUiMmo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bedoya’s expected nomination comes at a time when the FTC has faced heightened scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EhJXDe"&gt;A naturalized immigrant from Peru, Bedoya has researched the effects of technologies like facial recognition on minority groups. The Center on Privacy and Technology was particularly critical of facial recognition during his tenure, producing &lt;a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.flawedfacedata.com/"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; of the technology’s expanding scope and potential for racial bias. In 2015, Bedoya, along with eight other advocates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/16/8786885/privacy-advocates-quit-facial-recognition-group-in-protest"&gt;withdrew from a Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; privacy and facial recognition forum, arguing that the project would not do enough to protect consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3CYhR"&gt;Bedoya’s expected nomination comes at a time when the FTC has faced heightened scrutiny over its light-handed approach to privacy regulation. In 2019, the FTC settled with Facebook over its Cambridge Analytica scandal, securing a $5 billion fine and a number of new consumer protection promises. Despite the large number, the settlement was seen by many, including Democratic commissioners, as not going for enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXvM2h"&gt;At the time, Chopra &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying, “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxL8Hd"&gt;In July, the FTC approved a new rulemaking process that could &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-vote-could-pave-way-for-new-privacy-rules-11625171274"&gt;make it easier for the agency&lt;/a&gt; to enact new privacy rules on its own — without the help of Congress. If confirmed, Bedoya would likely help guide any new privacy-related rulemakings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgzgpF"&gt;The White House has yet to formally nominate Bedoya, as of publication. Once nominated, the Senate Commerce Committee would likely hold a confirmation hearing for Bedoya before voting to approve the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi0n93"&gt;FTC Chair Lina Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;was officially confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by the Senate in June. Over the last few months, she has laid out an aggressive antitrust agenda for the agency, especially as it pertains to the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hasn’t decided whether to appeal the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd07Y2G1J0y_cyh8iC04BbcEFWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852281/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyYrSd"&gt;Apple is still weighing whether to appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;last week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;antitrust ruling&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. In a call with reporters, a representative said Apple was still evaluating its legal options and had not made a decision about its next steps. The position contrasts sharply with Epic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it intends to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpwrPk"&gt;Apple reiterated a position it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;took last week&lt;/a&gt;, casting the ruling as a near-total victory. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dismissed nine of Epic’s 10 claims, including ones that would have required iOS to allow third-party app stores and payment processors. She ordered Epic to pay damages for breaching its developer contract. Apple also doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;return Epic’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the iOS App Store, and it can choose to terminate other Epic-affiliated developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3O8ah"&gt;Apple hasn’t taken a position on whether it will ban any Epic-related apps beyond &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Asked for comment, a representative said Apple is still looking at its options regarding Epic’s future on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm8ccl"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite"&gt;Epic said Apple&lt;/a&gt; might cut off support for the widely used Unreal Engine on iOS — a nuclear option in the conflict between them. That seems theoretically possible now, but Apple has publicly taken a measured tone so far, saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;“welcome” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back into the App Store&lt;/a&gt; if it removed its non-Apple in-app purchase option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XsB9s"&gt;While Apple won most claims, it was found to be violating California’s Unfair Competition Law with its anti-steering rules. A court order will require it to let developers link to alternate payment options outside their apps, although they still need to use Apple’s in-app purchase system within them. That order will take effect in December if Apple doesn’t appeal and win a delay of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtwMqZ"&gt;For now Apple says it’s studying how it could change its rules to comply with the order, which it characterized as line-editing Apple’s terms of service. But unsurprisingly, it doesn’t have any answers to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What comes next for the App Store?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i46PCnuYdn54rk3JYSgtw-kZ6-0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852010/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vxzkF"&gt;On September 10th, a verdict finally arrived in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and it has left the App Store model in a precarious state. Epic wanted to do away with the system entirely, breaking Apple’s control over software distribution on iOS — but the ruling stopped well short of that. Instead, we got an ambiguously worded injunction that seems to open the door to developers skirting Apple’s commission system — or at least making it easier to use non-Apple payment methods outside their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2bJ1Y"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, Apple pushed to cast it as a victory — and Epic seemed sure it had lost. It’s understandable: until we see how Apple reacts and how the court looks on Epic’s recent appeal, it’s hard to know for sure what the injunction will actually mean. The ruling could be a significant leak in Apple’s carefully controlled ecosystem. But for that to happen, Epic and its allies will need a lot to break in their favor, both inside the courtroom and out. There are still lots of places for Apple to fight, and lots of ways to pare back developers’ small glimmer of a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLtFXm"&gt;Here are the four most important questions from those fights, the questions we’ll be watching particularly closely in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LUEC9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much freedom does this ruling actually give developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jos2mP"&gt;For all the complexities of the case, the actual order issued by the court is simple. It zeroes in on a single sentence in Apple’s App Store guidelines, which Apple is now forbidden from enforcing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfyla"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIjpkc"&gt;The one thing that’s clear is that developers have to be allowed some way to forward users to outside payment systems. But as my boss Nilay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;points out here&lt;/a&gt;, the “buttons” clause is ambiguous and could let developers make those systems look a lot like Apple’s official option, even if they open Safari or another app for the actual payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ePca6"&gt;Enforcing that interpretation will take a lot of legal work from developers and a lot of developer-friendly rulings in court. From the other side, there will be lots of opportunities for Apple to chip away at the injunction’s force. It’s hard to say how interested courts will be in defending it. But if they aren’t, the App Store could still be a very risky place for developers using alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMkF8u"&gt;In particular, there’s a real threat that Apple will still be able to impose the so-called Apple tax on whatever new payment system is allowed. In theory, the App Store’s commissions are levied to support the entire store, not just the payment system, and in her ruling, the judge considers the idea of Apple allowing alternate payment methods but requiring the same 30 percent cut via audits or other systems. (My colleague Adi explores this in the seventh section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;her deep dive on the ruling&lt;/a&gt;, under the heading “Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges.”) If that’s borne out in an actual legal order, the door would slam shut on alternate payment systems pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EDQ92r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will Apple change its App Store rules in response to this ruling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wlIOuT"&gt;The other half of the equation is Apple itself, which is almost certainly going to change its App Store rules if the order stands, if only to change the anti-steering clause. The specific rule about referring to outside payment systems is out, but Apple still has broad legal authority to write its own rules for the App Store. So what new rule will the company write to replace the old one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU0qdE"&gt;In particular, there are lots of ways Apple could discourage outside payments without banning them entirely. There’s the commission rate idea we’ve already discussed, but Apple could also place restrictions on how outside payment links are presented. The company could require specific price differentials between Apple’s IAP system and any competitors, and it could require the systems to be presented side by side — whatever the company thinks will pass muster with the court and keep developers using the Apple system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HcdZh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will external payments look like on the App Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vEXiBf"&gt;When the dust has settled on both those questions, developers will be left with some alternatives to Apple’s built-in payment system. It could be a simple button or a maze of links and forms — and a lot will be riding on where external payments land on that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flmTxP"&gt;The specific numbers on this are important, since developers will be balancing the cost of friction against the extra money they get from sidestepping Apple. On the face of it, a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style app will get an extra 30 cents for every dollar of in-app purchases that don’t go through Apple’s system (minus whatever fees the cost of providing the alternative service eats up). But it also seems likely that leaving Apple’s walled garden will add friction to the process, which means there will be fewer overall dollars being spent through the alternate path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McEMuJ"&gt;But how many fewer? If you lose four out of every ten customers by kicking to an outside payment system, then there’s no point putting it in place — but if it’s only two, you’ll still come out ahead. The specific UX details will make an enormous difference in determining that attrition rate: How large is the button? How many extra taps? Can Safari force you to enter in your credit card number each time you make a new purchase? Each extra step will nudge developers back toward IAP, and make Apple’s App Store profits that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UoerZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of the App Store will move to external payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WrL9vF"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s dream in launching this lawsuit was to break Apple’s control over software on iOS. That didn’t happen, and as long as the ruling holds up on appeal, Apple’s control over iOS looks more solid than ever. Under the rules of the injunction, the only way Sweeney can hurt Apple is if developers vote with their feet and leave, taking their commissions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsbZED"&gt;Apple is particularly dependent on big developers like Epic, which have enough profits to pay 30 percent commission rates and generate the bulk of the App Store’s revenue. Crucially, the court’s injunction isn’t limited to games or in-app payments, so there’s no telling how much of the developer base will leave Apple’s payment system. If that happens, Apple could be forced to switch to give up the commission system for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4h2Rx"&gt;So far, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;doesn’t look like that’s happening&lt;/a&gt;. The response from most developers has been noncommittal, and some already seem to think it won’t make sense for them to pursue payments outside the Apple system. But with the actual changes still months away (and already under appeal), it makes sense for developers to wait and see whether the new system is worth pursuing. But after the many possibilities opened up on Friday, it seems hard to believe none of them will be interested in exploring their options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secret Facebook program reportedly let celebrities avoid moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fCPqgibTLw3o47GXbf8ly_uAUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851983/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp95A1"&gt;Facebook maintains a secret program to exempt athletes, politicians, and other high-profile users from its typical moderation process, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program is reportedly meant to stop “PR fires,” or bad press caused by pulling down photos, posts, and other content from high-profile users that should have been allowed to stay up. In reality, the program just lets these users break the rules in ways that would have gotten most people into trouble, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33YOfl"&gt;The program is known as XCheck, or “cross check,” and it’s ostensibly meant to provide additional quality control around moderation when it comes to high-profile users, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Posts from users flagged for XCheck are supposed to be routed to a set of better-trained moderators to ensure Facebook’s rules are properly enforced. But the program reportedly protected 5.8 million people as of 2020, and just 10 percent of posts that hit XCheck actually get reviewed, according to a document seen by the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HfCMrK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says it’s “working to address” issues with XCheck&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0JcZ81"&gt;High-profile users protected by the program include former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Candace Owens, according to the report. Users are usually unaware that they’re being given special treatment, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8hjkc"&gt;Facebook told the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;that criticism of XCheck was warranted and the company is working to fix the program. The system is meant to “accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding,” a spokesperson said. They added that “Facebook itself identified the issues with cross check and has been working to address them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsDHBF"&gt;While it’s a bad look for Facebook, which has promised even enforcement of its rules, there’s a level on which none of this is particularly surprising. Facebook has a long and detailed set of moderation policies. But it’s always been clear that those policies are enforced at Facebook’s discretion, with leeway often granted to major names or questionable content when removal might lead to problems for the company. With the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report, it’s evident that in some cases, Facebook’s own system, by design or not, is helping keep some of those posts online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is adding live translation services and coming to Facebook VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnFVqxSG_OeE5xC2t68V2GPiKJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851858/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNNwFC"&gt;Zoom plans to expand its support for automatic live transcriptions with the addition of live translation, and turn its whiteboard feature into a more of a fully-featured app, among several other changes the company announced at its Zoomtopia conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW8g54"&gt;Automatic live transcriptions / closed captions in English were announced to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;coming to free Zoom accounts in February 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Now Zoom says it “plans to provide real-time transcription for (as many as 30 additional languages) by the end of next year.” As part of that push, Zoom will also offer translation services for paid accounts, with the plan “to support real-time translation across as many as 12 languages by the end of next year.” Zoom wasn’t able to share details about which languages will be supported and when, but did say these improvements are a direct result of the machine learning know-how it gained by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556500/zoom-kites-acquisition-machine-translation-real-time-captions"&gt;acquiring German translation company Kites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yA1u4sf2OYWetoJ8kBl-BmM4fT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841259/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.04.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom Whiteboard, as accessed through the Zoom app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WEys5R"&gt;The other major change is coming to Zoom’s whiteboard feature. Zoom currently lets you &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard"&gt;create and share whiteboards during meetings&lt;/a&gt; to doodle together while you talk, but a planned expansion launching in beta later this year will make Zoom Whiteboard available outside of meetings in Zoom apps and the web. The basic drawing tools don’t appear to be different from what Zoom currently offers, the main change is how Zoom is treating Whiteboard as a product alongside video calls, rather than a feature that lives inside of them. You’ll be able to add sticky notes, drawings, and comments on your boards and view them whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ukWRl5SX0A6tI1NnHl6D-4AWZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841323/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.29.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A meeting in Horizon Workrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eh51lo"&gt;Early next year, Zoom is coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;. The shared VR meeting space will be able to host video meetings and connect to Zoom Whiteboard, according to Zoom. In VR, you can pin a Zoom Whiteboard to your virtual desk or to the wall for everyone to see, and draw along with colleagues attending a meeting through a traditional computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-6UqZDwvNgy-Cz-42lwAp-cYM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841327/widget.gif"&gt;

    <title>Litecoin price jumps 20 percent after hoax links the cryptocurrency and Walmart </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this Photo illustration a Litecoin logo " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZxsYbU3ciXhRx13tKeVtDscYco=/0x4:5000x3337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851585/1234956057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Litecoin spiked Monday after a false press release claimed Walmart would accept the cryptocurrency | Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rn8435"&gt;The Litecoin cryptocurrency saw its price spike by as much as 20 percent on Monday after a fake press release claimed Walmart would begin accepting Litecoin as payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJyULD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/13/2295879/0/en/Walmart-Announces-Major-Partnership-With-Litecoin-LTC.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; posted to GlobeNewswire linked to a non-functioning website, and there was no evidence of any Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which would have been expected since Walmart is publicly traded. Walmart’s official newsroom never included the release, and the company typically uses &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005697/en/Walmart-Launches-Walmart-GoLocal-a-New-Delivery-as-a-Service-Business"&gt;Business Wire&lt;/a&gt; to distribute releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FST50B"&gt;Several news outlets published reports based on the hoax press release, and a short time later &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LTC-USD?p=LTC-USD&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"&gt;Litecoin’s price jumped&lt;/a&gt;, along with those of other cryptocurrencies, before quickly falling back to the previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nbuq5b"&gt;It’s not yet clear who may have been behind the hoax press release, but a Walmart spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/13/walmart-to-accept-payments-with-cryptocurrencies-using-litecoin.html"&gt;confirmed to CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that the news announcement was fake. GlobeNewswire and Walmart didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjwmH5"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. For now, Instagram says it “is an internal prototype that’s still in development, and not testing externally.” Perhaps in the future, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cvg7r8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th, 10:42AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s excellent iPad Pro keyboards are $50 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GisnuiIf0xksBe0mmAhpgxxji2g=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851430/DSC00765.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gaWNh"&gt;You can do more with your iPad Pro by connecting it to a wireless keyboard, especially one that features a trackpad to help you navigate more like a traditional laptop. Brydge’s Pro Plus wireless keyboards with a trackpad for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzEnLHJyqg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $50 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $170, the model built for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $120. Naturally, the smaller Brydge Pro Plus for the 11-inch iPad Pro costs a bit less. It’s normally $150, but you’ll pay $100 for it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuGfkL"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is one of a few options available that has a backlit keyboard and a trackpad built in. It connects to your tablet via Bluetooth and recharges via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Live review: cool beans|76973" data-volume-uuid="2f0898dea" data-volume-id="76973" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-572" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eaNVny"&gt;Also seeing a steep discount today are Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live, the company’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;At Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can score a set for the lowest price yet. Originally $170, they’re just $105 new today in the color of your choosing. In our review, Chris Welch notes that these stand out with a powerful, yet balanced sound and lengthy battery life. Though, the noise cancellation can’t block out a ton of noise, and they might not be a perfect fit if you have very small ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or watch it above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7Ndwz"&gt;Blue is the only color not available through Amazon, but Best Buy has it &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzETWiLtNU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $120&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wx2m1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4c510I"&gt;SteelSeries is hosting a member-only 20th anniversary sale on gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, and accessories. If you have an account with the site (making one is free), you can save a considerable amount of money on an upgrade for your PC or console setup. I suggest that you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-sales&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the full list of discounted products here&lt;/a&gt;, but for some hand-picked recommendations, its Aerox 3 Wireless mouse with a lightweight design, waterproofing, and USB-C charging is $70 (usually $100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyrAnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdO5Tl"&gt;As for headsets, its Arctis Pro Wireless unfortunately isn’t looped into the anniversary sale, but the wired version is, which is the next best thing. Normally $250, you can get the Arctis Pro plus a GameDAC system included for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QhwtZ3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQWSY"&gt;Through Thursday, September 16th at 11AM, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/nioh-the-complete-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nioh: The Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt; is free of charge&lt;/a&gt; on the Epic Games Store. This third-person action game was developed by Team Ninja, known for its excellent and difficult &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Nioh &lt;/em&gt;is no different in terms of difficulty, though it usually gets compared to games like &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; in terms of game mechanics and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdIg3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kBP4B"&gt;Lastly, like SteelSeries, Garmin is also hosting an anniversary sale at its site, discounting several of its wrist-based trackers, as well as other accessories. Of note, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F643260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Venu&lt;/a&gt; is $270 (normally $350), while its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F702902&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-end Fenix 6 watch&lt;/a&gt; is $450 (normally $550). Check out the rest of the products here.&lt;/p&gt;
