    <title>WarioWare is more chaotic than ever on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MEa0GJ9YxbZwAEeQ6wQq7M0C0F0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752440/Switch_WarioWareGetItTogether_screen_02.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qU97Fk"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; series has always been about chaos. Its self-described micro-games are so fast and strange that by the time you understand what’s going on, the game has already moved on to something new. Switch owners will be able to get a taste of that with the upcoming &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; — and from what I’ve seen, it might be the most chaotic take on the series yet. Nintendo recently took me through a brief hands-off demo of the game, running through a couple of different modes. The one unifying factor between them all seemed to be a desire to take the micro-game concept to absurd new levels of mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOFxPP"&gt;The main change is that there is now a cast of characters you can play as, all plucked from the &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; universe. And each has their own unique controls and specific abilities, which can make a big difference in the seconds-long micro-games you’ll play through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L3jXjpA82jGWvyaL7aHzx7LBAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794584/Switch_WWGIT_2021_MediaPreview_VarietyPack_SCRN_03_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Daily grind” mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aEcK9k"&gt;These characters impact the main story mode, which you can play cooperatively, but from what I saw it looks like the “variety pack” mode will be where most of the fun is. Nintendo describes it as a “hub of party games,” which basically means that you’ll play through playlists that feature a series of themed challenges. One pack, called “daily grind,” features a handful of side-scrolling levels that get progressively stranger and more challenging. You start out as Wario but can collect power-ups that randomly turn you into another character, each of which has a completely different style of movement. One is on a skateboard, for instance, and will roll forward automatically, while another is a flying witch that can shoot magic spells. When you grab a power-up, you’ll have no idea which one you’ll transform into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD2Ty1"&gt;Another pack, called “puck ‘er up,” starts out like a game of air hockey. But every time you score a goal you’ll be transported to a random micro-game. That game actually appears as a tiny window in the middle of the screen, and while the player who scores tries to finish it, everyone else can mess with them, knocking the window around or squashing it so small that the game becomes virtually unplayable. It was stressful just watching; I can only imagine how wild it would be to actually play. I foresee a lot of arguments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Bh731iZkYNY59yPwDiSWiBKDQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794585/Switch_WWGIT_2021_MediaPreview_VarietyPack_SCRN_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Puck ‘er up” mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rdjWTX"&gt;As random as it is, &lt;em&gt;Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; does give you the option to prepare, at least a little. There’s a “play-o-pedia” mode, which is exactly what it sounds like: a playable encyclopedia. Here you get a feel for how each character controls, as well as play through endless versions of each micro-game you’ve encountered so far. It should help somewhat once you jump into the pure chaos of each game mode, where you never know what’s coming at you on a moment-to-moment basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dwj1YB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, which will be the first new entry in the series in three years, is launching on the Switch on September 10th, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1428525951302918145"&gt;Nintendo just released a demo on the eShop&lt;/a&gt; that you can play right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMBvnU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXhG00"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Chaim Gartenberg? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PmOWVxKOjwcsxY8wdm3Fw_FnKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752446/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Setting up a brand-new space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t05WxD"&gt;If you’re a frequent reader of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I’m sure the name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt; is known to you. He’s been reporting and commenting here for years on everything from the latest AMD Ryzen processors to the new trailer of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, and has become a familiar sight on videos as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRKEE"&gt;Chaim recently moved to a new space, which means he got a chance to set up a new space for working at home. We asked him to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKOcNC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at The Verge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km0TiP"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for just over nine years — I started as an intern in August 2012, and I’ve worked with a lot of pieces of the site over years, including being a reporter, working with our Circuit Breaker gadget blog, and, of course, writing tech news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4phBzV"&gt;Right now, I’m one of our news editors, which means a fair amount of news writing, but I also do a lot of tech reporting, in addition to helping out with our culture and games coverage. Mostly, though, I just like getting to write about the latest tech things and geeking out over obscure specification details (looking at you, incomprehensible USB-C standards!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsPs0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your workspace. How did you decide where and how to set it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9qIO"&gt;We just moved in the beginning of June, and one of the biggest things on the list for when we were apartment hunting was space so that both my wife and I could have our own offices. Mine is technically also our guest bedroom — we have plans to put in a trundle bed / couch-type thing just behind where I usually sit, but it doubles as a pretty spacious office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTLRYL"&gt;The one downside is that there’s not much natural light; the window just faces an internal wall, so I rely a lot on lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="desk and chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRCSkX93awjH_pRHmFvKPuXkhbM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793237/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A console table and a left-over office chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYEZC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRRfo9"&gt;The desk is actually a console table that my wife and I got for free when someone in her old building was giving it away. We ended up getting a nicer table for our entryway, though, and between the height and the width of the table, I thought it would be a pretty perfect desk for me (given that I couldn’t actually fit my knees under my old desk). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl5aqR"&gt;It’s not the deepest desk, so I do have to think a little bit about what I put on there, but it fits my laptop, a notebook, and a bottle of seltzer or a mug of tea, which is good enough for me. The smaller size also helps keep in check my usual tendency to just let all my clutter run rampant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mklBfo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJbHzb"&gt;I don’t actually have a lot of information on the desk chair. It was a gift from my wife, who snagged it when her company closed down their office when the pandemic started and let folks take home any furniture they wanted. (The wood and fabric filing cabinet that my printer is mounted on also came from there.) Given that I had been using a metal folding chair until then, it was a nice upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="headphones holder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw9GHsaWxt1CZILR2ZvNp-7EUSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793241/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sony MDR-7506 wired headphones hang near an M1 MacBook Air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="maZk30"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s go for the gold: could you tell us about the tech that you’re using there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqQMzX"&gt;Absolutely! The star of the show is my main work laptop: an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; issued me, and hands-down the best laptop I’ve ever used. Mine is a 16GB RAM / 512GB storage model, which I’ve customized with a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; sticker (which also helps avoid confusing it with other laptops). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLAjmZ"&gt;To the left is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powered-Wireless-Charging-iPhone/dp/B07LDDS5NY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Powered wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the newest charger around, and is basically only useful for charging an iPhone (it tops out at 7.5W), but it was cheap (since it’s the older model, it cost around $20) and it keeps my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; perfectly angled to unlock with Face ID so I can check my notifications at my desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrncy5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709358"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KG9bBO"&gt;The headphone stand is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fheadphone-stand&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22628813%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-chaim-gartenberg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fancy aluminum model from Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; that just plain looks nice. Hanging on it is a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony MDR-7506&lt;/a&gt; wired headphones, which I keep around for podcasting and any important video calls where I don’t want to risk using a pair of wireless headphones. I keep a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones on top of the metal cabinet to the left of my desk, too, since I live in NYC and, well, the city gets pretty loud sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xwLbI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7CJcW8"&gt;While I work almost exclusively off my laptop, I do keep a fancy camera setup for times that I need to look more professional on a Zoom call. The camera seen here on that tripod is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Premium-Compact-Multi-Interface-DSCRX100M2/dp/B00DM8R866?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony RX 100 II&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s actually not the one I use for calls. That is my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony a6000&lt;/a&gt;, but I needed it to actually shoot the pictures for this article. Similarly, I keep a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rode Podcaster microphone&lt;/a&gt; around for the occasional podcast appearance or when I’m interviewing people for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTX9QA"&gt;The speakers are a pair of since-discontinued Nocs NS2 Air Monitors from 2013 that I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/15/17234280/nocs-ns2-air-monitors-airplay-speakers-bluetooth-obsolete-problem"&gt;bought in college&lt;/a&gt; when they were extra cheap (the company had just released a newer model with Bluetooth). They still sound great, but they’ve never been updated to AirPlay 2, so using them as wireless speakers is a little flaky. Usually I just plug them into my laptop instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zfJJLT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWP5CH"&gt;To the left of the speakers is a stack of smart home gadgets: a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563079979439697" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Mini&lt;/a&gt; (for controlling the lights and air conditioning in the office), a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563126328264024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Wifi puck&lt;/a&gt; (one of three scattered around the apartment), an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Control-Automation-Supports-Assistant/dp/B08Y1PJZZH/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aqara hub&lt;/a&gt; for our light switches, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue hub&lt;/a&gt; for our smart bulbs. Please ignore the rat’s nest of cables peeking out behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntW15F"&gt;On top of the metal filing cabinet is what I like to think of as my charging station: it’s where I keep any gadgets or gizmos that need occasional charging, like my custom-hacked iPod (which has 256GB of internal storage and a quadruple-sized battery), my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, and my Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (when they need a top up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYSNXS"&gt;And then on the right of my desk is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2360DW-Wireless-Networking-Replenishment/dp/B00LEA5EJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brother HL-L2360DW&lt;/a&gt; laser printer that I bought in 2017. It’s a very basic printer: it only prints in black and white and doesn’t feature much in the way of bells or whistles. It is wireless, though, and does support duplex printing, both of which are more useful to me than color photos. I don’t actually have to print out that many things these days, but it’s extremely helpful for the occasional concert tickets, shipping labels, and other assorted random documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSVmIy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything special about the baseball?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WGYZ"&gt;I got the baseball from a Yankees game years ago that my dad took me and my brothers to, and it sits on top of a 3D-printed gear that one of my college friends made for me. Mostly, though, it’s just another thing to occasionally fidget around with during the day, &lt;a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_(object)" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Captain Sisko-style&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWbq3G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I envy you your Baby Yoda. (Although I have a Jawa that’s nearly as cute.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6qOCt"&gt;Thank you! I got it &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeWOYDChaim081921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F750337366%2Fthe-original-baby-child-the-baby-child" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from an Etsy seller&lt;/a&gt; when the Mandalorian had first kicked off Baby Yoda fever across the internet — something that actually turned into an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21069124/baby-yoda-dolls-etsy-disney-mandalorian-copyright-takedown-enforcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;interesting story for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Disney was issuing take-down notices for the most popular unlicensed toys featuring the character. He used to live on my desk at the office, but I rescued him from the empty office when I started working more remote last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A stuffed Baby Yoda from Etsy." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlFBLBvKkB29ZUKbrkD3oGzqp2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793235/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A stuffed Baby Yoda from Etsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Yankees baseball sits near a Sega Genesis cartridge." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YDm-L1JbXlG16JfdY0wEXufrTzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793234/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Yankees baseball sits near a Sega Genesis cartridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xE0W6g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also like your bulletin board setup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V7Vla"&gt;It’s very much a work in progress, but I had accumulated a lot of random bits of art, stickers, and patches over the year that were living in a drawer. I’m still planning to add a lot of stuff to that setup — especially some pictures — but it’s a big step up from the blank slate of wall that used to be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxO2UW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are a few old-fashioned touches: the dictionary, for example, and the Sega Genesis cartridge. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HanHIR"&gt;The Genesis cartridge has lived on various desks of mine since high school; Sonic is one of the first games I can ever remember playing, and while I don’t actually have a Sega Genesis anymore, it’s a nice reminder to have. The dictionary is more aspirational: I like the idea of thumbing through an actual paper book to look up things while I’m writing, although I usually tend to just use my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXm1Qf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is obviously a work in progress. Do you have any other plans to add decorations, furniture, or other stuff to the space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGHzHy"&gt;Absolutely. I’m currently looking into replacing the desk with a larger and adjustable standing desk, and potentially getting a monitor / keyboard / mouse setup so I can dock my laptop and use a more traditional desktop setup with a bigger screen (that’s probably also better for my posture). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGwPuV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1oOai"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic wants Fortnite to be the last game standing — so it’s stealing ideas </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aukTBHVR2QDXrp1zQFXnIKXOBoM=/105x0:1940x1223/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752259/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_3.45.54_PM_copy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic liberally borrowed ideas from &lt;/em&gt;Among Us&lt;em&gt; for its &lt;/em&gt;Impostors&lt;em&gt; mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdKTA6"&gt;This week, Epic Games added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;a new mode called &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where players complete tasks on a ship while two impostors sneakily try to teleport as many agents off the ship as they can. If that sounds like a familiar gameplay loop to you, you’re not the only one who feels that way — fans immediately noticed that the mode borrows heavily from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, a social deduction game that exploded in popularity in 2020 and was built by a tiny indie studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yshybb"&gt;The team at Innersloth, the developers of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630365/among-us-fornite-impostors-mode-clone-reaction"&gt;are justifiably upset with Epic’s blatant repurposing of its hit game&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the underhanded tactics by Epic, &lt;em&gt;Impostors’&lt;/em&gt; polish and surprising connections to the ever-expanding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; story could be a preview of the future of Epic’s smash hit as it tries to be the ultimate live service game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSvx98"&gt;While I’m not a fan of how liberally Epic borrowed from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, when I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve found it pretty enjoyable in large part because it doesn’t mess with &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; formula. As an agent, you’ll complete all sorts of rote tasks that are somehow a lot of fun. Many of the tasks have &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-specific tie-ins, such as punching a Peeley punching bag or tossing soda cups at a miniature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/4/18057306/fortnite-fortnitemares-end-cube-gone"&gt;Kevin the cube&lt;/a&gt;. And as an impostor, I did everything I could to sneakily take out my opponents, and I was able to do so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;while dressed as Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oFUeGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has offered an Among Us-like mode before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyLysI"&gt;Epic has actually offered an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;-like mode before, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/spy-within-ltm-infiltrates-fortnite?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;called The Spy Within&lt;/a&gt;, but that was made by fans using Fortnite’s in-game Creative mode tools. I personally thought it was clunky, and I only played a couple matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5lB9N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has Epic’s full might behind it, which ensures the game looks great and plays well. I know that I’ll come back to it a number of times in the coming days. And Epic’s direct involvement with &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; has an added bonus in that it ties directly into the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54XByB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1RNbUaCKHA"&gt;The trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the mode, for example, reveals that it takes place on a ship run by the Imagined Order — or the IO, which players might recognize as the identifying acronym of AI enemies you can encounter in the main battle royale mode. And some of the tasks you complete as an agent in &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, such as filling up a treasure chest with goodies, seem to imply that the people on the ship are the ones preparing the main battle royale island for every single drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yOMHC1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1RNbUaCKHA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AnuNS4"&gt;I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; almost daily for more than three years, so the added world-building in &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; has been a nice surprise. But it’s also a clever way to entice players back into the game who may not care about battle royale as much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIF7nT"&gt;Lifting good ideas also isn’t really a new strategy for Epic; it’s just the most brazen recent example. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; actually launched as a co-op survival game, but Epic quickly added the now-gargantuan battle royale mode following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156952/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-epic-games-fortnite-battle-royale-genre-gdc-2018"&gt;the huge success of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127222/fortnite-creative-mode-season-7-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; is Epic’s take on games like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, where players make their own worlds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSDv7l"&gt;Epic’s ability to clone &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; opens the door to other hand-crafted modes mimicking nearly any genre or popular title. A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; kart racer? A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; strategy game? A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; RPG? I wouldn’t be surprised if Epic made any or all of those at some point in the future. And presumably, these hypothetical modes would be offered for free right inside the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; app you and 350 million registered players (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;as of April 2020&lt;/a&gt;) already have, meaning you could easily try them out just by downloading the game’s latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBWMR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; mode also indicates that Epic is starting to look past rivals like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been more than just its core battle royale mode for some time, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;spectacular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;concerts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;the violence-free Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301688/fortnite-party-royale-christopher-nolan-movies-date"&gt;even in-game movie screenings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; suggests Epic could bring the most popular games into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, too, to try and keep you from playing anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4INo6"&gt;Just as Netflix sees its key rivals as things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187357/netflix-views-numbers-disney-amazon-fortnite-youtube-earnings-bird-box"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/netflix-sarandos-co-ceo-tiktok-threat/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Epic now views &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as competing with anything else that can command your time. To succeed against everything, the game has to become everything — an impostor through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US COVID-19 data has never been good enough  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Pop Up Covid-19 Vaccination Site As Cases Rise in Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MlUBf_RU0kpBClm1ec0ECECfNPM=/208x0:5053x3230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752115/1234713347.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp8UNm"&gt;When American experts first started to worry that COVID-19 vaccines weren’t working quite as well against delta as they did against earlier coronavirus strains, they didn’t have much domestic data to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was only collecting data on post-vaccination COVID-19 cases if they led to hospitalization or death — the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/09/america-is-flying-blind-when-it-comes-to-the-delta-variant"&gt;wasn’t doing big-picture tracking&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 in vaccinated people. Only a few states and counties were collecting and publicizing that information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hd5Uq"&gt;The CDC was doing some analysis, but it wasn’t sharing the information quickly, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/cdc-data-delay-delta-variant/"&gt;frustrating experts&lt;/a&gt; who hoped for a more dynamic picture of how the delta variant was affecting vaccinated people. The agency finally released some data this week as part of the justification for pushing booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, but the scope was still limited and came too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuSSac"&gt;“It’s not acceptable how long it takes for this data to be made available,” a senior CDC official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/cdc-data-delay-delta-variant/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, US experts had to rely on vaccine data from other countries: Israel, Canada, the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5lxXv"&gt;Data, or lack thereof, has been one of the biggest challenges in the US COVID-19 response. From the early days of the outbreak, health departments have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627004/public-health-data-gaps-fax-email-politico"&gt;struggled to collect information&lt;/a&gt; on cases, and often only had delayed and incomplete data. Most clinical trials investigating COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/health/covid-drugs-antivirals.html"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; were small and couldn’t deliver conclusive answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SccQm"&gt;Part of the problem was that the US has a fragmented public health system, and data is siloed off in individual hospitals. Places with national health systems, like the UK, were in a better position to understand big-picture trends through the pandemic — its National Health Service was able to run a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22397833/dexamethasone-coronavirus-uk-recovery-trial"&gt;multisite clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to look at COVID-19 treatments, which eventually identified treatments that saved lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7YIAlK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC is a retrospective agency, it’s not in business of gathering real-time info that requires analytical work and providing partial answers. We relied on it to do these things mistakenly judging it’s capabilities, resources, culture. We need to make reforms going forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1426890092036202499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAUpob"&gt;Over 18 months later, the problems in the US persist. Officials don’t have a good grasp on where and how COVID-19 is spreading in certain groups, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1426887512216190978"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC isn’t equipped to collect real-time data, he notes. That constrains the country’s response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCDZd1"&gt;Now, those problems are making it harder to understand the dynamics of coronavirus infections from the delta variant in vaccinated people in the US. Delta has only been the dominant coronavirus variant in the US for around two months, so it could take some time for the patterns to emerge. But officials are moving forward with booster plans based only on the limited information they have now. Hopefully, the data will eventually catch up with their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXuoMq"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

The shots still hold strong against severe disease. (Helen Branswell / &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Wb8PNu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02259-2"&gt;Delta’s rise is fuelled by rampant spread from people who feel fine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus starts building up around two days before people start showing symptoms of COVID-19. Most infections happen in the pre-symptomatic phase, making it harder to stop the spread. (Smriti Mallapaty / &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

(Meredith Wadman / &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kCISmj"&gt;“When they started talking about covid coming out I was like, ‘All right, we’re gonna create a vaccine, there’s gonna be a big demand for it, and Montana doesn’t have a lot of access...I hate to say it, but I literally took advantage of covid-19 to open up and push forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 4.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 209,804,195 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,400,048 people who have died worldwide — 624,832 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is shutting down its Android Auto mobile app in favor of Google Assistant </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lzNnr2AQmobn4BGu0Y3LZpJ4_E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751811/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="grFFuz"&gt;Google has confirmed it’s shutting down the standalone “Android Auto for Phone Screens” app with Android 12. Instead, anyone who wants a driving-friendly interface for their Android phone should use the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/10217503"&gt;Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/a&gt;, which is available within Google Maps, or the native Android Auto interface available in select cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI7gUa"&gt;“For those who use the on phone experience (Android Auto mobile app), they will be transitioned to Google Assistant driving mode,” Google said in a statement. “Starting with Android 12, Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience. We have no further details to share at this time.” Google says that the experience isn’t changing for anyone using Android Auto in compatible cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nq181o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCrYJg"&gt;Google’s confirmation came after &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-auto-for-phone-screens-killed/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some users were seeing a message in the Android Auto for Phone Screens app that said the service is “now only available for car screens” and pointed phone users towards Google Assistant driving mode as a replacement. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/android-auto-phone-screen-stops-working/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Android Auto for Phone Screens app now says it’s incompatible with Pixel devices running Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on6LzG"&gt;Android Auto’s app history is a little bit messy, but this is a move that’s been a long time coming. The saga started in 2019, when Google decided to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/9468382?hl=en"&gt;build most of Android Auto’s features into Android 10&lt;/a&gt; as a system level feature, and discontinue the previously downloadable app. That’s fine for anyone with an Android Auto-compatible car, but anyone with an older vehicle would have lost access to the driving-friendly interface available directly on their phone. Bad times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLcoTy"&gt;Google’s plan for these users was a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535644/google-assistant-waze-driving-mode-shortcut-features-release-date-io-2019"&gt;Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/a&gt;, but this software was delayed, and despite being announced in 2019, it only started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521549/google-assistant-driving-mode-available-android"&gt;rolling out late last year&lt;/a&gt; (it’s subsequently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/16/google-assistant-driving-mode-international/"&gt;expanded internationally&lt;/a&gt;). That meant Google effectively needed a stopgap measure, and the clunkily named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949523/android-auto-standalone-app-android-10-users"&gt;Android Auto for Phone Screens app&lt;/a&gt; was born. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850630/google-android-auto-assistant-maps-driving"&gt;great rundown of the situation&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 if you want to learn more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s bulky magnetic wireless charger is almost as fast as promised</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCHWRHeVVfHKxufRxvech5n-DSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751721/DSCF7747.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The MagDart charger has a hefty cooling fan.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WaizF"&gt;Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607214/realme-magdart-announced-magnetic-wireless-charger-devices"&gt;Realme launched MagDart&lt;/a&gt;, its MagSafe-a-like ecosystem of magnetic wireless charging products. The headline device is a 50W brick that Realme professes to be the fastest magnetic wireless charger in the world — it’s supposed to be able to charge a 4,500mAh battery from 0 to 100 percent in 54 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybi3Mj"&gt;Naturally I was interested in trying this for myself. Realme sent me a 50W MagDart charger, a 65W SuperDart wall charger to plug it into, and a Realme Flash “concept phone” with built-in MagDart compatibility. (The only other Realme phone to work with MagDart is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;new GT flagship&lt;/a&gt;, and even that requires a specialized case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IY5D6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aWfnOh"&gt;The Flash isn’t a commercial device, but it’s a very nice phone nonetheless. That’s mostly because it’s very obviously a repurposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, made possible by the fact that the two companies share ownership and suppliers along with Oppo and Vivo. The camera configuration has been reshuffled a little — for little reason, since the onboard software doesn’t even include a camera app — but the hardware is otherwise identical. The Flash’s “About phone” screen even still lists the device name as the OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKvFybczN8yqodinvrfYCJQWedA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794463/DSCF7751.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Realme Flash is clearly a repurposed OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOK2d9"&gt;The MagDart charger, meanwhile, is a chunky metal box with solid construction and a glossy top panel that makes contact with the phone. The magnetic force is fairly strong; you can attach the Flash and hold it facing the ground, though it’ll fall if you shake it around a little. Despite the charger’s bulky build, it’ll still stay attached if you try to pick the phone up, so you can’t really use it as a stationary wireless charger without securing it to a hard surface. There’s a cooling fan that varies in its noise output. At its loudest, I would say it’s comparable to an Intel-based MacBook Pro with a couple too many Chrome tabs open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIp7gv"&gt;When it came to testing the performance, I found that the charger wasn’t able to wake the phone at 0 percent power. For that reason, I used a USB-C cable to turn the phone on and get it to one percent, then took my measurements from there. I didn’t use the phone while charging other than to wake the screen to check the battery status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2iY7k"&gt;Basically, it turns out that this is indeed a very fast wireless charger, though not quite as fast as Realme claims. After 15 minutes the Flash was already at 35 percent, and reached 60 percent after half an hour. The 45-minute mark took it to 82 percent, but by the promised 54 minutes it was only at 95 percent. The Flash eventually hit 100 percent at a round 60 minutes. For comparison, an iPhone 12’s battery will only be around half full after that long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFiFE3Ax-iR29WxSuKDmFW8ytUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794466/DSCF7752.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The charger will stay attached if you pick your phone up from the desk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxnVL"&gt;So yeah, MagDart works. I’m not really convinced by the form factor, though — if speed was a priority, plugging in a cable wouldn’t be much less convenient than this, if at all. You can’t practically use the phone with this charger attached, either. (I’ll note here that Realme has also developed a thinner 15W MagDart charger that looks similar to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZUdzu"&gt;Still, magnetic wireless charging is all about versatility, and the MagDart technology seems to work well for what it is. For readers in the US in particular, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on whether it shows up in actual shipping OnePlus devices any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Calendar will let you record where you’re working to help organize office meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCvwZf1TX_biHQYQl6LYQ61tgB8=/9x0:504x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751664/Onboarding_dialog.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Set your working location to make scheduling easier.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5O4wR"&gt;Google is adding an option to its Calendar service to let you show where you’re working on any given day of the week, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/share-where-youre-working-from-in.html"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will start rolling out from August 30th for users on select Google Workspace plans, and will be accessible via Calendar’s settings menu alongside its existing working hours options, as well as on the weekly calendar view below where it shows each day’s dates. Available work locations include “Office,” “Home,” “Unspecified,” or “Somewhere else.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXpiyc"&gt;According to Google, the option is being added so it’s “easier to plan in-person collaboration or set expectations in a hybrid workplace.” It follows a surge in the popularity of home and hybrid working due to the pandemic. This has meant employees increasingly have to keep track not just of people’s working hours, but also their location, when planning in-person meetings and other events. Google Calendar’s new feature should help here. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HrHrFPPEfVXAF8jWS4GMAeDG1C8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794459/Working_location_in_calendar.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working locations can be edited from the calendar view (pictured) or settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kI25m1"&gt;Google says the new working locations feature will be switched off by default, but users will have the option of enabling it after it starts to roll out at the end of the month. The feature will be available across the following tiers: Google Workspace Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, Nonprofits, and G Suite Business. However it won’t be available for G Suite Basic customers, as well as customers on the Google Workspace Essentials, Business Starter, Enterprise Essentials, and Education Fundamentals plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epomaker AK84S review: a great wireless keyboard, plus some quirks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Overloaded with features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z7XMFi"&gt;When it comes to mechanical keyboards, you generally have the option of playing it safe with a major brand like Corsair or Razer, or buying from smaller enthusiast manufacturers with more interesting designs and often more affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utxAly"&gt;Of the two groups, Epomaker definitely falls into the latter. Its recent AK84S wireless keyboard isn’t something you’re going to be able to buy off the shelf from Best Buy, and as yet it’s not listed on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EF6D975C-83A8-4D76-8F75-3CC54819E1A3"&gt;Amazon storefront&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, after recently being funded via a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epomaker/epomaker-ak84-aluminum-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now available to preorder directly from &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-ak84s-1"&gt;Epomaker’s own site&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it’s focusing on shipping keyboards to its Kickstarter backers for now before moving on to orders made via its website in mid- to late September. Shipping can take anywhere from one to two weeks, depending on which method you choose, Epomaker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcUCD8"&gt;So yes, the Epomaker AK84S isn’t a keyboard you can impulse buy and expect to be clacking away on within 24 hours, and it suffers from a lack of documentation and baffling companion software. But it also has a starting price of just $89 and offers one of the nicest typing experiences I’ve had from a mechanical keyboard. On balance, I think it’s a price worth paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ip2T4z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10709205"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGdujQ"&gt;Epomaker’s AK84S is available in a wide variety of different configurations, so much so that it’s almost impossible to list every one. As of this writing, however, the cheapest configuration on Epomaker’s website appears to be the version with optical switches, ABS keycaps, and an aluminum frame paired with a plastic case, which comes in at a price of $89. If you want other options, like supposedly more durable PBT keycaps (more on this in a bit), mechanical rather than optical switches, or a fully aluminum case, then you can pay as much as $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAFCmZ"&gt;Switch options include an array of optical or mechanical Gateron-produced Cherry MX clones, including reds, blues, blacks, browns, yellows, silvers, greens, and whites (some have an additional $5 fee). Epomaker also has its own Chocolate-branded switches available with this board, which unfortunately I wasn’t able to try out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6JLJt"&gt;For this review, I’ve been using an AK84S with a full aluminum frame, PBT keycaps with the panda design, and clicky blue Gateron switches. You’ll see in the pictures that my model came with a purple case, which isn’t an option listed on Epomaker’s website, but the company says it plans to eventually make this model more widely available. The all-aluminum version also lacks adjustable feet, which you get on versions with a plastic case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/df8swVwT_ITihHI1phFwBrDiU58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788528/jporter_210816_4716_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thankfully this default layout can be customized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehB-9WTyIlTuB3Osrw-MPkP2NOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788527/jporter_210816_4716_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some keycaps can look cluttered with all the different functions they perform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFG51h"&gt;The AK84S has a 75-percent layout, which is similar to what you’ll find on most modern laptops. Unfortunately, it’s US (aka ANSI) only, which means you’re out of luck if you prefer a UK or European ISO layout with a bigger Enter key and smaller left Shift. My model came with bottom row keycaps for both Mac and Windows in the box, so I could swap Option and Command for Windows and Alt keys. There’s no physical switch to change the keyboard’s layout between the two operating systems, but you can do so with a button shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJIFT0"&gt;Before I get into any nitty-gritty details, I just want to emphasize how fantastic the core typing experience of the AK84S is. On my all-aluminum model, keypresses had a lovely crisp feeling to them, and the keyboard as a whole felt wonderfully solid to type on. One rough spot is the keyboard’s stabilizers — the mechanism that stops longer keys from wobbling around. They’re a touch on the rattly side, which detracts from the overall quality of the rest of the board. But as a whole, the keyboard is a joy to type on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kWoGA9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10709354"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VPSqus"&gt;While I enjoyed the day-to-day typing experience of the AK84S, I had a few issues with the keyboard over time. For starters, I don’t love the look of Epomaker’s stock keycaps. Each key has so many different functions that the keycaps end up looking really cluttered, and given the option, I’d probably swap them out for a third-party set (there aren’t any particularly non-standard keys you need to be aware of on this keyboard, but pay close attention to the bottom row of any keycap set you buy). The printed legends on my PBT keycaps also weren’t especially durable; after a month of use, the legends on the home row keys had started to fade. Given the option I’d probably opt for the ABS keycaps. ABS as a plastic has a reputation for going shiny over time, but the legends on the versions available for the AK84S are double-shot, which means they’re not going to wear away anytime soon. There’s also an unusual silicone keycap option which I wasn’t able to try, and which costs $65. Maybe it’s a fun novelty? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LcKMi8bmg0ztivf1323dcWpZWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788530/jporter_210816_4716_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice the fading, particularly on the ‘K’ and ‘L’ keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rxv8fl"&gt;As well as swapping keycaps, the AK84S also features hot-swappable switches, which make it easy to swap out the switches that come with your board without having to use a soldering iron. You use the small metal tool that comes in the box to ease each switch out of its socket, before inserting a replacement. It’s a painless process that gives you the easy option of using a vast array of weird and wonderful switches with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXzOxq"&gt;I generally think that if a 75-percent layout is well thought out, then it’s possible to fit every key most people use on a daily basis. But the AK84S’s Windows layout is a little strange. The default screenshot button is unlabeled (it’s F13, in case you’re wondering), and there’s also a whole key dedicated to Insert, a button I’ve never pressed on purpose. Personally, I would have also preferred Home and End keys over Page Up and Page Down, but the former are accessible via a function button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pX69VA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Layout customization is tricky, but possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XAmRSt"&gt;Thankfully, it’s possible to customize the AK84S’s layout using a piece of companion software, but the lack of documentation makes this an… interesting process. For starters, as of this writing, Epomaker’s website doesn’t actually list the AK84S on its &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/pages/software-downloads"&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;. But if you choose to download the software available for “SK, GK &amp;amp; NT Keyboards’’ you’ll end up with a program called GK6XPlus, which recognized the AK84S and allowed me to customize its layout (after I asked the company about this, it said it would amend its website). I wouldn’t call it an intuitive piece of software to use, but after a bit of experimenting I ended up with a layout that carried over regardless of which computer I plugged the keyboard into. This software can also customize the keyboard’s RGB backlighting, if you’re into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh0y2I"&gt;I used the AK84S wired over USB-C for the majority of my time with it, but it also includes Bluetooth connectivity and a 4,000mAh battery that Epomaker claims should get you 50 hours of use with its RGB lighting turned on, or as much as 880 hours with it turned off. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to validate these claims, but in theory they put it far ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-hot-swappable-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron’s competing K2&lt;/a&gt;, which offers up to 240 hours of use. Like many other wireless keyboards, the AK84S can remember up to three devices it’s been paired with, and you can switch between them easily with keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_A1e4cuhCvqJR7El5H790gXPIMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788525/jporter_210816_4716_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The aluminum case doesn’t have adjustable feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOLwvrSYgMjkw2OA6YVvZA0wBcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788529/jporter_210816_4716_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re called Panda keycaps for a reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykKOSW"&gt;I have a lot of small problems with the Epomaker AK84S. I think its default Windows layout isn’t great, the printing on its PBT keycaps is low quality, and the support and documentation you get with the board leaves a lot to be desired. You’re also dealing with a small company that’s shipping all its products internationally, which means you have to be patient with orders in a way that you don’t with a more mainstream brand like Corsair or Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o5bSIE"&gt;But the core typing experience of the Epomaker AK84S is good enough that I’m willing to forgive basically all of these issues. Yes, its software is clunky, and yes its documentation is bad, but they’re both problems that can be overcome with a little patience and then ignored. Add in other quality-of-life features like Bluetooth support and hot-swappable switches, and you’ve got a board that should last you years. Or at least until you get an itch to buy another keyboard for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays mandatory return to office until January 2022, citing COVID-19 surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SnhLWY1-n2OuGl3h_ZHVZNVISk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751419/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQ5JS0"&gt;Apple is delaying its mandatory return to offices until at least January 2022, citing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The company will give employees a month’s notice before they have to return to in-person work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhOMfs"&gt;In an internal email sent this evening, Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of people and retail, encouraged employees to get vaccinated and noted that Apple retail stores remain open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNPfap"&gt;“I know there are feeling of frustration that the pandemic is not yet behind us,” she wrote. “For many colleagues around the world, this period has been a time of great tragedy, suffering, and heartbreak. Please know that we are all here to support one another and stand with one another during such challenging times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9ysli"&gt;The company, which previously discouraged working from home for most employees, changed its stance in June when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Tim Cook said he would test a hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that would require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. That date was then moved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;to at least October&lt;/a&gt; — and now the New Year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKC6Xf"&gt;Some employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against this model&lt;/a&gt;, saying they want a more flexible policy where anyone who wants to work from home can. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIAE4V"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company is working on a humanoid robot and that it will build a prototype “sometime next year.” The humanoid robot will leverage Tesla’s experience with automated machines in its factories, as well as some of the hardware and software that powers the company’s Autopilot driver assistance software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN7SgY"&gt;Musk, who has spoken repeatedly about his fears of runaway artificial intelligence, said the Tesla Bot is “intended to be friendly,” but that the company is designing the machine at a “mechanical level” so that “you can run away from it, and most likely overpower it.” It will be five feet, eight inches tall, weigh 125 pounds, and have a screen for a face. The code name for the bot inside the company is “Optimus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9iL4HB"&gt;The robots will be designed to handle “tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/AI"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; reads, but little else, at least at first. (There, the bot is simply called “Tesla Bot.”) “I think essentially in the future, physical work will be a choice, if you want to do it you can,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3Zfb6"&gt;Musk revealed drawings of the robot near the tail end of his company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"&gt;AI Day&lt;/a&gt;” event, where it showcased some of the artificial intelligence and supercomputer technologies that it’s working on with the goal of one day powering self-driving cars. The company also had a mannequin version on the stage, which wasn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VIJQx"&gt;Tesla’s history is littered with fanciful ideas that never panned out — like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tweetermeyer/status/1182096334888697857"&gt;a solar-powered Supercharger network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/videos/battery-swap-event"&gt;battery swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMM0lRfX6YI"&gt;robotic snake-style chargers&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s anyone’s guess as to whether a working Tesla Bot will ever see the light of day. But the company is where it is today because of Musk’s sheer will. Asked about the near-term economics of entering the robotics industry, though, Musk said “we will have to see.” &lt;/p&gt;
