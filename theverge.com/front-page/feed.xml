    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the depth mapping information captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch expands its range of cardio fitness measurements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MZF_p6rHzWWg5qcqiTmTQIcUPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511554/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_834.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8LbAqT"&gt;Apple is expanding the range of cardiorespiratory fitness that can be measured on the Apple Watch. Starting today, the Health app will classify users as having “high,” “above average,” “below average,” or “low” cardio fitness. Low levels will trigger a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxcYAI"&gt;The Watch tracks fitness through a metric called VO2 max, which is the amount of oxygen your body consumes during movement or exercise. The Apple Watch was already tracking average and high VO2 max for users during exercise. This update expands the range it measures and allows users to see their levels when they’re walking around, not just when they’re working out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38tz_1zBSHM870lZ1KB5AZTTpMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169614/Apple_iphone12_health_cardiofitness_high_12142020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find Cardio Fitness in the Health app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e16ONH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it tracks lower ranges of VO2 max by using Watch sensors like the heart rate monitor and accelerometer. Typically, VO2 max is calculated using specialized equipment in a lab while someone exercises on a treadmill or other piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHMICi"&gt;“Apple Watch now brings estimation of low cardio fitness levels from clinics directly to a user’s wrist, so people have more insight into how they can improve their long-term health through daily activity,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5neNBn"&gt;Wearing a Watch is certainly less time-intensive than going into a lab, but it may not be as accurate. &lt;a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20856601/can-your-watch-estimate-your-vo2-max/#:~:text=As%20the%20AHA%20statement%20noted,during%20a%2012%2Dminute%20run."&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing Garmin and Polar smartwatches to typical lab testing found that the watches tended to be off by about 5 percent. Apple does not report how well the Watch compares to traditional, clinical VO2 max measurement methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNNMSA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9ZsDM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83GKo4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KipPia1gaxnOLI5WAvLtRaxJMmM=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511532/Apple_fitnessplus_applewatch_iphone12_hiit_workout_12142020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ExdzK"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163126/apple-fitness-plus-launch-date-subscription-service-price"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; service is officially out now, marking the launch of the company’s latest subscription service. Fitness Plus offers a variety of guided workouts (similar to competitors like Peloton) and costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1uP46"&gt;At launch, the service features workouts in 10 categories: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is0lNI"&gt;To actually use Fitness Plus, you’ll need — at minimum — an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) running the just-released watchOS 7.2 update paired to an iPhone 6S (or newer) running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;also-just-released iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3613O"&gt;If you’re planning to use an iPad or Apple TV to view Fitness Plus videos, you’ll also need to have those devices updated to iOS 14.3 or tvOS 14.3, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pONw5l"&gt;Once you’ve updated your iPhone and Apple Watch, Fitness Plus can be accessed through a new tab in the Fitness app that’s preinstalled on your phone. iPad users will be able to download &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953"&gt;the Fitness app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, while Apple TV users will automatically see the app installed once they’ve updated to tvOS 14.3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i1f3q"&gt;Existing Apple Watch owners can get a one-month free trial of Fitness Plus, while customers who buy an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) can get three months of free service. A single Fitness Plus subscription can be shared with up to six users through Apple’s Family Sharing service, and it’s also included in the Apple One Premier plan (which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage for $29.95 per month).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy will have the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S available online on December 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDzKbWEAkV6jik4jOmZqUwNehjw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511427/vpavic_4261_20201026_0181.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yll61X"&gt;It’s been over a month since the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S were released, and if you have been trying to purchase one of the new consoles, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;quite challenging&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, Best Buy announced today that it would have &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/more-gaming-consoles-3-day-sale-arrive-dec-15/"&gt;both next-gen consoles available for purchase &lt;/a&gt;on December 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGMstT"&gt;In a blog post today, Best Buy confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726545763475866779" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726545749697705309" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; would be restocked tomorrow. The retailer announced that stock would be available “sometime after 8AM Central Time.” While a firm time has yet to be announced, Best Buy has product listings up for the next-gen consoles, including several bundles that include additional items like extra controllers or games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J85xPF"&gt;Best Buy will sell the consoles exclusively online, as the retailer announced in November that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;they won’t be sold in stores until 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But if you manage to secure either a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S tomorrow, you can order online for in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTTKxY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Q3Gp"&gt;Like every major hardware launch, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;demand for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S is through the roof&lt;/a&gt;. With the consoles launching during a pandemic, most retailers have sold the products exclusively online at inconsistent times to help manage the spread of the coronavirus, complicating the situation as an influx of users flock to webpages or make use of bots to hopefully secure a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXy0n4hmacezCmw8o0jTVEsGyVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511387/acastro_191108_3782_blackfriday_guidebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pemr8N"&gt;We’ve reached the final few days before the holidays, and in the interest of getting gifts delivered on time — and not paying handsomely for shipping — you should be wrapping up your shopping as soon as you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQed2y"&gt;Thankfully, several retailers are making those shopping duties cheap and easy by offering free and fast shipping. It wouldn’t be the holidays without a little stress, but you can avoid at least some of it by finishing up your shopping before the window for on-time delivery comes to a close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2H0J7"&gt;As of publish time, a couple of retailers haven’t released their holiday schedules yet; we’ve noted that where relevant. We’ve also listed the delivery windows for FedEx, UPS, and the USPS in case you are shipping packages yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walmart http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartcorporate/5684733482/" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AogG2oBR7QpZVNk9k_zuZn-iv_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4153903/walmart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="86BhAt"&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2Fshipping-and-delivery-with-walmart.com%2F0fa824faeca24e599e0e5292a7185336&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Neaev"&gt;Store pickup is always the best way to ensure you get your gifts in time, but (especially this year when many of us are staying at home) it’s luckily not your only option. While we’re still waiting for Walmart’s holiday cutoff dates, these are Walmart’s usual shipping arrangements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="K5VU5w"&gt;Walmart’s free NextDay shipping is available for certain orders over $35; under $35, it costs $5.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Eapkp2"&gt;Other items are available for two-day or three- to five-day shipping, depending on the item; shipping is free for orders over $35 and costs $5.99 if they are under $35&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon box" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pE6frkFgU__XDKeRVNSzDpRBeho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/798460/amazon-box.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iN9Qwa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2rQHVfG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UDGSQU"&gt;We’re still waiting for Amazon’s holiday shipping calendar, but as is always the case, you’ll get your gifts faster if you have an Amazon Prime subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gi0tQJ"&gt;Target provided the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for the 2020 holiday shopping season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="el8DbS"&gt;We’re using our nearly 1,900 stores, just miles from 75% of the population, to fulfill online orders and give guests choices in how they get their online purchases. The fastest and most convenient way to shop online at Target is via our contactless same-day services – with Shipt delivery offered nationwide, and free Order Pickup and Drive Up at nearly every Target store. These services have orders ready the same day, and can be delivered or picked up whenever a guest chooses – no membership required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkSahx"&gt;While same-day services are the fastest growing and most popular, we also anticipate shipping millions of items out the back of our local stores, which reduces the distance and time it takes for delivery. We don’t have a broad cutoff date to share at this time, but our guests are always able to see the date an item will arrive before checking out. Guests in need of last-minute gifts or other holiday items will have the option to place same-day pickup and delivery orders up to two hours before their local Target store closes on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>TikTok TV app now available on Samsung smart TVs in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lzcO5727wCrXDwjjqcLu0h-ET18=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511065/TikTok_PR_w_2_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s TV app is now available on Samsung smart TVs in the UK.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGAw62"&gt;TikTok is launching an app on Samsung smart TVs in Europe, allowing users to scroll through their For You feeds and see other TikTok videos, the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-and-tiktok-launch-tiktok-app-on-samsung-smart-tvs-in-europe"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The TikTok TV app is available in Samsung’s app store and is compatible with 2018 and newer models. It will come preinstalled on all new Samsung TVs. The app will roll out to users in the UK first. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iu0rZ3DVy6C9Xbnwa0UZ86bcYsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169388/TikTok_PR_w_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok / Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ItKCw0"&gt;The app displays videos from a user’s feed in a strip across the top, with videos in different categories to check out. According to the news release from Samsung, users can like, view, and comment on trending videos and block or mark content they’re not interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkGYo1"&gt;TikTok videos will continue to be displayed with a vertical aspect on TVs, the company confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gU012g6GBvu3szgSGi_0ffYCMJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169390/TikTok_PR_w_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok / Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7SntWH"&gt;The Samsung app is different than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;More on TikTok app the company launched on Amazon Fire&lt;/a&gt; TVs in August. The Fire TV app includes interviews with creators and a “This is TikTok” category to spotlight creators on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM2z5N"&gt;The Fire app is essentially a container app of curated content, TikTok says, while the Samsung app is closer to what users see in the mobile app. Neither requires a TikTok account to view content, but users who log in to the Samsung TikTok app will receive more personalized content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwdBz4"&gt;According to mobile analytics firm App Annie, when combining info from iOS and Android, TikTok was &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90584368/tiktok-beats-out-facebook-to-become-the-top-app-worldwide-by-downloads-in-2020"&gt;the most-downloaded app of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNv2P1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s chaos made America a sitting duck for cyberattacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyber-Attack Defense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSmfiNNEbm3hqEv9WVz-jgjKxNU=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510872/863052542.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former CISA director Christopher Krebs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo By Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7lvE1X"&gt;On Sunday night, as news broke of one of the broadest state-sponsored cyberattacks in recent memory, former civilian cybersecurity chief Christopher Krebs was stuck tweeting. A state-sponsored attacker linked to Russia had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;compromised senior-level cabinet agencies&lt;/a&gt;, implicating huge portions of the government and private sector. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;Fired in November&lt;/a&gt; from his role leading the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) after &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-senators-criticize-trumps-firing-of-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs/"&gt;a political spat with President Trump&lt;/a&gt;, Krebs had to watch it all take place from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngEsZL"&gt;“I have the utmost confidence in the CISA team and other Federal partners,” Krebs said. “I’m sorry I’m not there with them, but they know how to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BtX7ng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m sorry I’m not there with them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmFhJL"&gt;While it’s hard to say if he would have handled the hack differently, Krebs’ position on the sidelines underscores just how ill-prepared the United States is for a compromise of this scale. For the past four years, Trump has treated the federal cybersecurity effort as one more partisan battleground, with attacks and vulnerabilities embraced or rejected largely on the basis of their value as a political cudgel. Faced with a government-spanning compromise that will require deep analysis and careful cooperation, there’s little trust left to draw on, which could make a bad problem even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD1FUT"&gt;To understand the challenge facing CISA and the rest of the government, it helps to understand the frustrating structure of this latest hack. The early headlines focussed on agencies like the departments of treasury and commerce, but the hack is much broader than that, and we still don’t know precisely which systems may have been compromised and what data may have been taken. Digging out every possible compromise will take discretion and trust — the kind of qualities Krebs had been building up in his role and lost when he was abruptly shown the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krbg3N"&gt;The heart of the hack is a network management tool &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion"&gt;from a company called SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;. State-sponsored attackers compromised that tool, enabling them to deploy malicious code to anyone using the system, disguised as a software update. Experts are still piecing through the details (there’s a detailed technical writeup from Microsoft researchers &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a more accessible explanation from the journalist Kim Zetter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but the gist is that anyone who used the product was potentially exposed. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/1338514528829665283"&gt;a financial filing earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, SolarWinds estimated that roughly 33,000 clients were vulnerable to the malicious updates, with “fewer than 18,000” actually infected. (It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/us-agencies-hack-solar-wind-russia/index.html"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;last week’s compromise&lt;/a&gt; at the cybersecurity firm FireEye.) It’s a huge hack, spanning vast and sensitive portions of both the federal government and the private sector — and we’re still in the process of figuring out what’s affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QO8elY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is no way to run the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u1UdDk"&gt;As you might expect, CISA (Krebs’ former agency) has been at the heart of the government response. In &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network"&gt;an emergency alert sent late on Sunday night&lt;/a&gt;, the agency called on every federal agency to assess their exposure, with reports due at noon on Monday. There’s a natural inclination to hide the damage (no one likes seeing headlines about how they might have been hacked), but an effective response depends on agencies being brutally honest. It’s the only way to understand the scale of the mess and start to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnoeEe"&gt;Tackling that mess will take a lot of work and trust. Cybersecurity is a difficult job under the best of circumstances, and while the National Security Agency keeps military secrets locked down, civilian agencies (like treasury and commerce) are often left with few resources to fend for themselves. The result has been an embarrassing string of hacks, from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach"&gt;the China-linked compromise of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015&lt;/a&gt; (which, among other things, leaked the fingerprints of every federal employee) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8212107/state-department-hackers-email-russia"&gt;a string of hacks at the State Department&lt;/a&gt;. Federal agencies have a terrible record of protecting data over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzF6wM"&gt;Given a renewed mandate in 2018 to address the disastrous security at US civilian agencies, CISA hasn’t had much time to work — but under Krebs, the agency was gaining trust. The director had bipartisan support and was seen by the cybersecurity community as an impartial arbiter, someone who would be honest about the facts on the ground even if it was politically inconvenient. Then, a few weeks ago, he was fired for displaying exactly these qualities. As Trump raised groundless claims of election fraud to distract from his loss at the polls, Krebs issued a clear statement on the issue, saying he had seen no evidence of vote tallies being changed in the election. In a matter of days, he was out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="46F5Hj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government only works when we insist on it working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2nfQYX"&gt;We shouldn’t overstate Krebs’ work in preventing the hack itself. The SolarWinds compromise dates back to March, so it happened on his watch. There’s no indication that the past few months of compromise would be any less ugly if Krebs were still in the director’s chair. But the incident response &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be less ugly. Acting director Brandon Wales hasn’t been confirmed and has held his position for less than a month. In the midst of an unusually chaotic transition, he’s asking agency infosec leads to trust him through one of the most sensitive events of their working lives. It’s a difficult position under the best of circumstances, and it would be much, much easier with a trusted hand in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIMVjJ"&gt;It’s all the worse because Krebs’ firing is just the latest in a long chain of similar incidents. President Trump took office actively denying the role of Russian active measures in the 2016 election, despite an unusually definitive attribution by US intelligence agencies. In the years since, he’s taken any suggestion of Russian influence as a personal incident and made denying it a kind of loyalty test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcW0Lz"&gt;Put simply, this is no way to run the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus. I am not naive enough to call for a return to bipartisan comity, but we should be able to agree on basic facts like threats, vulnerabilities, and attackers. But the hazy nature of attribution has turned cybersecurity into a partisan battleground and ensured that nothing gets done on either side. Over the past four years, far too many Republicans have responded to persistent Russian attacks by insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/avatar-there-is-no-war-in-ba-sing-se/"&gt;there is no war in Ba Sing Se&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G0AYu"&gt;We may hope that when Trump leaves office in January, however begrudgingly, this pattern will start to change. President-elect Biden has made &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2020/11/biden-team-highlights-cybersecurity-focus-first-cabinet-picks/170274/"&gt;promising moves&lt;/a&gt; in his federal cybersecurity staffing, and at the very least, we can expect a return to the mild competence of the Obama era. But the past four years have taught us that institutions only improve through active effort, and the government only works when we insist on it working. In the wake of one of the most devastating compromises in federal history, it’s time to insist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With iOS 14.3, the iPhone 12 Pro camera app will support a new kind of RAW image capture | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CjD4Dc-aHIXVZevPiiPAw2S2Xg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510623/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bGSNF"&gt;Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 on “eligible in-stock items” from its retail stores. If you need to get a gift for an Apple-loving person in your life this holiday season, that $5 shipping could be a handy way to get that gift in a pinch. The company says it offers scheduled courier delivery of eligible items “in most metros.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQkRCI"&gt;That low $5 fee won’t last forever, though — in the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fshipping-pickup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s a limited time offer. And you can’t use it on customized Macs, engraved products, or orders paid with financing or by bank transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAVkF1"&gt;If you don’t need your purchase within two hours, Apple says it offers free next-day delivery on any in-stock Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, or Apple Watch, and free two-day delivery on “almost everything else.” The company also has a useful guide that lists &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fholiday-shipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;when you’ll need to order a product&lt;/a&gt; in order to get it by December 24th with free shipping, though some items, like the HomePod mini, are already unavailable for delivery by Christmas Eve with free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9st2en"&gt;Apple is also allowing you to initiate returns for “eligible products received between November 10, 2020 and December 25, 2020” until January 8th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
