    <title>The biggest announcements from EA Play Live 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBvlg13eJs36KsZHMyiKwAhhqiM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618443/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_02_ElAlamein_1920x1080_NoLogo_36533960f60d011d03e2.08465894.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield Portal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Kq1Lh"&gt;At EA Play Live, the game publisher spent around an hour detailing the future of some of its biggest franchises. And while much of the news was to be expected, a few surprises snuck in — including an all-too-brief tease of a return to a horror favorite. If you missed the show, here are the most notable things EA revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4LZE15"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5WeBNfX-og?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BVOSei"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350881"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; is getting a next-gen remake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud9wjR"&gt;The best was saved for last, with a quick tease of a full-on remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;, which promises to update the survival horror classic for modern hardware. There isn’t much to go on just yet — it doesn’t even have a release date — but the new version of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; will launch on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="923tAn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4qWMcQfOCc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G3igtj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is getting a creative mode of sorts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lQoIpc"&gt;One of the bigger surprises was the reveal of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; Portal, a mode for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s built around user-generated content. The mode will feature all seven maps from the base &lt;em&gt;2042&lt;/em&gt; game, along with six maps from classic &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; titles, which can then be remixed by customizing modes, settings, along with weapons, soldiers, and other content pulled from multiple era-spanning &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; games: &lt;em&gt;2042, 1942, Bad Company 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BF3.&lt;/em&gt; There’s even a logic editor (though EA says you won’t be able to edit the maps), and user creations can then be uploaded so others can play them, too. Portal will launch alongside &lt;em&gt;2042&lt;/em&gt; on October 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dV5rG9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQBKoZIYNrs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XNdL2D"&gt;A beautiful new &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; cinematic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="leLCpi"&gt;Developer Respawn previously teased the next &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;character, Seer, but now we have a really good look at him, thanks to this gorgeous cinematic that has me pining for an &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; animated movie. You’ll be able to learn more about how he actually plays when the first gameplay trailer drops on July 26th. Seer will be part of the game’s next major update, called Emergence, which will launch on August 3rd. And for esports fans, the second season of the &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; Pro League is slated to start in September, with a prize pool of $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ncY1C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCn8xNHwE4Q?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YoaWd7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is getting a new season&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vv3MyH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453234/knockout-city-dodgeball-ea-velan-studios"&gt;Multiplayer dodgeball game &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is getting a big update, when a film-inspired second season called “Fight at the Movies” kicks off on July 27th. Most notably, the update will add a new map that takes place across what looks like a wide range of faux-Hollywood sets, and which the developer describes as “ever-changing movie-inspired arenas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cuke5R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3-BJfhnlWY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZZ8Voe"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Grid Legends&lt;/em&gt; brings story to racing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTh0n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173732/ea-codemasters-buyout-agreed-price-need-for-speed-dirt"&gt;Codemasters is now under the EA umbrella&lt;/a&gt;, and the studio’s next release looks to merge movie-style storytelling with realistic racing. &lt;em&gt;Grid Legends&lt;/em&gt; features a story mode complete with real actors — including &lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt; star Ncuti Gatwa — and cinematics that were filmed in XR, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;much like &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to tell what looks like a classic sports underdog story. Players will also be able to create custom races that mix and match vehicle types; so you can have an open-wheeled racecar going up against a truck if you want. The game is slated to launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators target Section 230 to fight COVID-19 vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDFb8LhY047KPxEKj5242YOkQdw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618408/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXG65Z"&gt;As coronavirus cases rise in unvaccinated populations, Democratic senators are introducing a new bill Thursday that would strip away Facebook and other social media platforms’ Section 230 liability shield if they amplify harmful public health misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOYsB5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733658/EHF21778.pdf"&gt;The Health Misinformation Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) Thursday, would create a carveout in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act opening social media platforms like Facebook up to lawsuits for hosting some dangerous health misinformation. The bill directs the Health and Human Services secretary to issue guidelines on what should be classified as “health misinformation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRedun"&gt;The carveout would only apply in situations where online misinformation is related to an existing public health emergency like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as declared by the HHS secretary. It would only open a platform up to liability if the content is being algorithmically amplified, not through “a neutral mechanism, such as through the use of chronological functionality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FQumcX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDR5zl"&gt;“For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans. These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,” Klobuchar said in a statement Thursday. “The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be and it is our responsibility to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDG5dZ"&gt;It’s not clear that removing Section 230 protections would have the effect lawmakers intend. Section 230 protects platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585152/biden-white-house-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-section-230-first-amendment"&gt;from liability for illegal content&lt;/a&gt; hosted on their platforms — but misinformation is not illegal in itself. As a result, it’s unclear what a potential lawsuit against Facebook for misinformation would look like, even once the protections of Section 230 are stripped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaO8n"&gt;The bill’s introduction comes just a week after the Biden administration issued a new report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;calling out vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; on social media. The report called for an all-of-society push to address coronavirus misinformation, including new policy recommendations for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The report didn’t mention Section 230 but suggested that platforms redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying misinformation” and to build more “friction” into sharing functions to urge users to avoid sharing false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfOPaI"&gt;Shortly after the report’s release, White House officials and President Joe Biden called out Facebook specifically for its role in amplifying vaccine misinformation. Last Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;Biden told reporters that platforms&lt;/a&gt; like Facebook were “killing people” by platforming false vaccine information. A Facebook spokesperson responded, saying, “The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKjiGj"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;Biden walked back&lt;/a&gt; that statement, saying that misinformation was “killing people,” not Facebook itself. Still, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/biden-will-make-every-effort-to-convince-americans-to-get-vaccinated-wh-117059141549"&gt;told MSNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the administration was reviewing Section 230 in order to determine a means of combating COVID-19 misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JM5b3K"&gt;“Certainly they should be held accountable,” Bedingfield said of social media companies Tuesday. “It is a big and complicated ecosystem, and everybody bears responsibility to ensure that we are not providing people with bad information about a vaccine that will save their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCR7x6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZifISg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dead Space is getting a remake on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HymwvHcoYYJi7FFohmeKELtXg0g=/186x0:2241x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618390/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.55.22_PM_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4nwcyu"&gt;One of survivor horror’s most iconic games is getting a next-gen facelift. At its EA Play Live event, Electronic Arts revealed that a remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; is in development and will be launching on the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. The publisher says the game is “rebuilt from the ground up” with EA’s Frostbite engine, and studio Motive — best-known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496153/star-wars-squadrons-review-single-player-campaign-x-wing-tie-fighter-space-simulator-vr"&gt;the space shooter &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — will be handling development. There’s currently no release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqNXuc"&gt;This will mark the first entry in the franchise since &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2013. The franchise was originally created and developed by Visceral Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16491044/ea-visceral-games-shut-down-dead-space-studio-star-wars"&gt;which was shuttered in 2017&lt;/a&gt; while working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184562/ea-star-wars-open-world-cancelled-project-shut-down"&gt;a single-player &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; game that was eventually canceled&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Visceral spirit does live on in a way as former &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; executive producer Glen Schofield is working on &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2020/12/16/22178915/callisto-protocol-striking-distance-glen-schofield-interview-dead-space-sci-fi-horror-pubg"&gt;a new sci-fi horror game called &lt;em&gt;The Callisto Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battlefield 2042 players can build and share custom modes with Battlefield Portal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5_3DvjwserKP4kbL0MCzreGWIs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618336/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_08_MashUp_1920x1080_36533960f60d79f0ba19.70981622.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7pnx8"&gt;EA has announced a new feature coming to &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042. &lt;/em&gt;Called &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; Portal, it’s a customizable creative mode that will let players create and share their own unique battles and multiplayer scenarios that combine weapons, maps, and vehicles from across the franchise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L06Yc"&gt;Portal goes beyond the custom multiplayer mode settings that are typical for an online shooter, though, by allowing players to mix and match elements not just from &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, but from earlier titles in the series like &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield: Bad&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Company 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4hyBRHbh6agNB7hftGBdj7hqNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732823/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_02_ElAlamein_1920x1080_36533960f60d716bf117.48560501.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rAN5"&gt;Players will also be able to incorporate weapons, gadgets, and vehicles from across the various historical eras, alongside classic factions pulled from the previous games. Portal will incorporate the various multiplayer classes from those earlier titles, meaning that you’ll be able to play as &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;’s Recon role just like you did in 2011. And of course, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;’s new additions to the franchise will be available to work with, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvnQvt"&gt;For example, players will be able to create battles pitting teams of soldiers pulled from &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt; against the futuristic military of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, or a vehicle match between classic WW2 planes and modern attack helicopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAXAS4"&gt;And in addition to offering &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;’s new complement of maps to play with, Portals will also offer six classic maps: &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Battle Of The Bulge and El Alamein maps, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield: Bad Company 2&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Arica Harbor and Valparaiso maps, and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;’s Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwjLRj"&gt;Dice says that it’ll also be adding any new content it adds to the main &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; to Portal, so there will be plenty of new toys to play with in the custom mode as additional weapons, vehicles, and classes are added over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpXtGa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is set to release on October 22nd for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox Series X / S, and PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yep, Jordan Peele’s next movie is called Nope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLQt00TTx1ZZH63bSagDFNFDORg=/0x51:1238x876/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618331/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.16.38_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6PukQW"&gt;Critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele’s next “terror” is officially called &lt;em&gt;Nope, &lt;/em&gt;according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?s=20"&gt;a poster&lt;/a&gt; the director shared on Thursday. The details of the project remain (delightfully) shrouded in mystery, and you’ll still have a bit longer to wait before you can see it yourself — &lt;em&gt;Nope &lt;/em&gt;is scheduled to be released in theaters on July 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGo95K"&gt;There’s not a ton to go off of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?s=20"&gt;the poster Peele tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, but it does feature an ominous dark cloud with what looks like a kite string trailing out the back of it. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/994004752466767872?s=20"&gt;Peele’s tease&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257721/us-review-jordan-peele-get-out-lupita-nyongo-winston-duke-elisabeth-moss-tim-heidecker-horror"&gt;his last film &lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was equally evocative and obtuse, so while there’s probably meaning to be gleaned from a mysterious cloud rolling over a mountain town, it’s also just nice to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaoR5m4L80"&gt;let the mystery be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HWTA2Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;☁️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/iiDRwVLmbr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iiDRwVLmbr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jordan Peele (@JordanPeele) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuhD8H"&gt;The new poster also confirms that the cast for &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt; is as stacked as the film is mysterious. &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/04/steven-yeun-jordan-peele-new-movie-1234627528/"&gt;Both Steven Yeun and Daniel Kaluuya&lt;/a&gt; were rumored to be in talks to join the film in April 2021, but now their participation is confirmed. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jordan-peele-keke-palmer-film-1234694742/"&gt;Keke Palmer was cast in the film&lt;/a&gt; in February as the female lead. What exactly the three actors will have to do with a physical (and likely metaphorical) cloud remains to be seen, but feel free to get your meteorological speculative engines running while we begin the wait for a trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors’ $4.5 billion merger is being held up by spam filters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrXK_1Y9PL0iA-3SZbcGHPH88U4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618295/ahawkins_210623_4646_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wSUZB"&gt;Lucid Motors is on the precipice of completing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; that will give the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;Saudi-owned&lt;/a&gt; electric vehicle startup $4.5 billion in fresh capital. But the deal is being held up, in part, by spam filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdO3iz"&gt;The California-based startup is merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, called Churchill Capital IV that is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange. For the merger to go through, Churchill shareholders have to approve a number of proposals that outline the terms. That vote was supposed to close today, but Churchill &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/churchill-capital-corp-iv-to-adjourn-and-reconvene-special-meeting-of-stockholders-to-friday-july-23-2021-to-allow-stockholders-more-time-to-vote-on-one-remaining-required-proposal-for-the-business-combination-with-lucid-motors-301339577.html"&gt;extended the deadline to Friday&lt;/a&gt; because not enough shareholders have approved a key proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVBN7"&gt;There are a few possible reasons why. The first is the spam filter issue. To participate in that vote, shareholders are sent a specific code. It’s possible, Churchill chairman Michael Klein said on a call with investors on Thursday, that some shareholders haven’t voted yet because these codes went straight to spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQp3S7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnab9"&gt;“It should have been mailed or emailed to all stockholders. I know this is technical. And I know that some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder or otherwise. But it’s critical and important to vote and to have the tools to vote,” he said. “I need to remind you to check your emails, and check your spam emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTgppZ"&gt;The other reasons have more to do with just how wild the stock market has gotten in the last two years. Churchill announced the merger in February, and in the months since, its shares have been one of the most heavily traded of all the SPACs on the market. Some of that comes from people really believing in Lucid Motors and its potential in the growing market for electric vehicles. But since the beginning of the pandemic there’s been an enormous influx of “retail traders,” everyday people buying and selling stocks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;apps such as Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop and AMC&lt;/a&gt;, the more popular Churchill stock became, the more it may have looked like a good way to make some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZveRYw"&gt;Since many of these retail traders are new to the stock market, they’re less likely to understand the vagaries of SPAC mergers. That’s fine; most people had never heard of SPACs before they took off last year. But if they simply bought what they thought was a hot stock, they may not even know about the vote in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uG4s8V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Please, please vote”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAVkBQ"&gt;“We welcome all of the new shareholders,” Klein said Thursday. “However, we need you to participate in the election process. In particular, if you are participating from the new trading platforms, the new apps that may not necessarily be directing you clearly to a voting service — we need your vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoTFE"&gt;Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson made a similar plea. “I want to be super clear about this. I need you to vote for proposal two,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how large or small you are. Every single investor vote counts, we’re all in this. So whether you’re a Robinhood trader or managing your portfolio via a traditional brokerage, please, please vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6egLDW"&gt;Finally, since apps like Robinhood have lowered the burden to play the stock market, retail traders are more likely to turn around and sell the shares they buy instead of holding on through the merger. And this can make it hard for companies to know who owns their shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4hxqSm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some SPACs are having trouble running down shareholders&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1WHgW"&gt;Public companies use third-party services known as “proxy solicitors” who are supposed to keep tabs on shareholders so they can be reached when it’s time to vote on company matters. But this has gotten harder because so many people are trading SPAC shares, an employee of a company that recently merged with a SPAC tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This person said the spreadsheet their company received from the proxy solicitor was full of disconnected numbers or old AOL email accounts. Even when the company was able to track down the shareholder to ask them to vote, there was a good chance that person had already sold their shares to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi5fs"&gt;Klein and Rawlinson said they still expect the merger to close on Friday, and for Lucid Motors to take Churchill’s place as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. And while they’re &lt;a href="https://spacinsider.com/2020/09/28/forum-merger-ii-secures-sufficient-votes-for-extension-following-delay/"&gt;not the first to run into trouble trying to round up enough shareholders&lt;/a&gt; to approve a SPAC merger, the $4.5 billion investment hanging in the balance makes this last-minute delay feel just a bit more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banks, brokerages, PSN, the Steam Store, and more went down in massive internet outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Development of the police software VeRA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrC9o22AmhvhBOKzaNjc9Q595FU=/0x0:5334x3556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617873/1233144145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5cq91"&gt;Many websites — including banking pages, brokerages, and gaming services — were affected for just over an hour Thursday, as part of a major internet outage. During the outage, consumers were unable to access services like Ally Bank, Fidelity, Sony’s PlayStation Network, Airbnb, and more. Several airline sites were also affected: Delta, British Airways, and Southwest’s sites were either down, or had important functionality like flight check-ins broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHK7wX"&gt;Many sites appear to be functional again after Akamai, a content delivery network that hosts much of the internet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Akamai/status/1418251400660889603"&gt;started rolling out a fix to its service&lt;/a&gt;. “We are continuing to monitor the situation and can confirm this was not a result of a cyber attack on the Akamai platform” says Akamai in email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Jqqi"&gt;It quickly became clear that Akamai was involved, with many websites attributing the outages to the CDN provider. Larger outlets included the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA/status/1418248990823534592"&gt;New York Metro Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1418249256519929856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who tweeted that their service outages were due to Akamai. Cloudflare’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1418242657134944258"&gt;has chimed in&lt;/a&gt; to say that its service isn’t to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xdd26q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You may be unable to access several digital tools, including &lt;a href="https://t.co/1mbGGZApQy"&gt;https://t.co/1mbGGZApQy&lt;/a&gt; and MYmta, because of the global Akamai outage right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, please DM &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NYCTSubway&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTBus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NYCTBus&lt;/a&gt; if you need any help.&lt;/p&gt;— MTA.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="KnLfD0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware that some customers may be experiencing issues with our platforms. We are working urgently on resolving the issues.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx2P80"&gt;Gaming services were also hit hard by the internet issues. &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/"&gt;DownDetector reported&lt;/a&gt; a spike of over 40,000 users who were having issues with the PlayStation Network, and the Steam store also had functionality issues. DownDetector also reported issues with games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;Sony’s PSN status page&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged an issue shortly before we published this post: “PlayStation Network services are up and running, but there are external, internet-wide issues that might affect your experience,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SkQIRW_FoEwRpqI4w3btdB_dcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733503/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some sites displayed error messages during the outage, and some fail to load all together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvrHSa39_xvebyNZpBv4G3naPEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733512/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.33.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://livemap.pingdom.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pingdom’s live map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; shows that the issue was global.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9JD0"&gt;As far as more essential services, a number of banks’ websites also appeared to have been rendered non-functional during the outage, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABC13News/status/1418218123535142925"&gt;there were reports&lt;/a&gt; of 911 systems being down across multiple states. It is, however, unclear if the emergency services outage was related to the other web outages — the Sheriff’s Department of Grayson County, Virginia, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GraysonCountySheriffsOffice/posts/"&gt;reported that&lt;/a&gt; its 911 outage stemmed from a fiber cut, which has now reportedly been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsrUTO"&gt;Outages like this show that, while the web is decentralized in theory, many major sites’ functionality is dependent on a handful of companies. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525820/fastly-outage-bug-customer"&gt;a single customer&lt;/a&gt; hit a bug that brought down Fastly’s CDN service — and Reddit, Twitch, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;went down with it.&lt;/a&gt; Problems with Amazon’s Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;have also caused major outages&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ‘about this result’ feature will now show why you got your specific search results </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HalrS1A1v1fMnsF6A4pySE1exbk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618100/google.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mSL97G"&gt;Google is updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22252443/google-about-this-result-information-search-results-wikipedia-vet-websites"&gt;its “about this result” feature&lt;/a&gt; for search results with an &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/learn-more-and-get-more-from-search/"&gt;interesting new addition&lt;/a&gt;: context about how and why the company’s algorithm landed on the specific results for the links that it surfaces when you search for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIhlFj"&gt;The company added the “about this result” information box earlier this year as a way to help users properly vet sources that they weren’t familiar with using data sourced from Wikipedia. The menu — accessed by clicking the triple dots at the corner of a search result— pops up and tries to provide additional background information about a website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeXZck"&gt;The update that’s rolling out today, though, doesn’t add more context about websites that might appear in search results, but rather helps shine a light inward on Google’s algorithm and how it links search terms to specific sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zv3xwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google adds ‘about this result’ information in search to help vet websites before you click","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22252443/google-about-this-result-information-search-results-wikipedia-vet-websites"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3xaHNQ"&gt;In an example provided by Google, a search for “how to cook fish in the oven” lands on a recipe from a site that included the words “how, cook, fish, and oven” and were related to other terms like “ingredients” and “recipe.” Google also does things like matching language and applying relevant geographic locations to help land on the specific result. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dZ7K77H5DQj7tROku-2PmQPn9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733303/how_to_cook_fish_in_the_oven.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KPSsu0"&gt;The company explains that the goal here is to help users who may not be as familiar with Google’s search system to understand a little bit more about what’s going on behind the scenes when they search and to use that knowledge to help them make better searches to find what they’re looking for in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j8u6J"&gt;The updated results should be rolling out to users now. To start, it’ll be available for English language results in the US, but Google hopes to expand availability in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBEMC3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s when and how you can preorder the Playdate handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQoyjn"&gt;Playdate, the quirky new handheld with a black-and-white screen and a crank on its side created by Panic and co-designed with Teenage Engineering, will be available for preorder starting Thursday, July 29th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;You’ll be able to secure a unit through the site play.date&lt;/a&gt; for $179. It’ll start shipping later this year &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/shipping/"&gt;in select countries&lt;/a&gt;, though the company still doesn’t have a concrete release date for the portable device. You can also preorder the Playdate Cover accessory that can protect the device for $29. If you preorder, you’ll be charged immediately, but Panic says you can cancel at any time for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcP20e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523929/playdate-preorder-game-lineup-dock-announced"&gt;Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser shared last month&lt;/a&gt; in a video update that “the sooner you order, the sooner you’ll get one, but we’re not going to close the door on you.” So, even if you’re a bit late to ordering, at least you won’t have to panic to get Panic’s Playdate. According to Panic, the first 20,000 or so units will ship toward the end of 2021, and orders after that will ship in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAa2Bq"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with this irresistibly cute handheld, it was announced in May 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351213"&gt;we just put up some in-depth impressions of the console and a few of its games&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll get new, exclusive games in waves called “seasons,” sort of like a TV show. For the first season, you’ll get two games every two weeks over a 12-week period. Panic is being cagey about game details (it hasn’t announced three of the 24 total games), but you can find some thumbnails below to somewhat get a sense of what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The common cold was rare during 2020 — but it’s having a resurgence</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dp5MiR"&gt;Levels of influenza and other non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses were at historic lows during most of 2020, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029a1.htm?s_cid=mm7029a1_w"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There’s still very little flu circulating, but other viruses — including parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses, which cause colds — are having an out-of-season resurgence in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggPiSY"&gt;Between October 2020 and May 2021, levels of the flu in the United States were at their lowest since 1997, the first year there’s flu season data available, the analysis found. There was very little flu reported &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic1/"&gt;all over the world&lt;/a&gt;, and experts think the protective measures people took against COVID-19 — masking, distancing — suppressed the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrVpVS"&gt;The nearly nonexistent flu season this year might mean that this fall and winter’s flu season could be more severe, the CDC report warned. Because there wasn’t much influenza around, people may not have been exposed to the virus at the same rates they usually are. That could blunt the normal levels of immunity to the virus. “Lower levels of population immunity, especially among younger children, could portend more widespread disease and a potentially more severe epidemic when influenza virus circulation resumes,” the authors of the report wrote. That means it’ll be especially important for doctors and nurses to encourage anyone older than six months to get their flu shots this fall, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an out-of-season uptick in parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4subxw"&gt;The circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a virus that causes colds in adults but can be dangerous for infants, was also muted during 2020 and early 2021. Rates started to tick back up in April 2021, which is unusual — normally, levels of that virus peak in January. Parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses followed a similar trend: levels were low through 2020 and then started to climb in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4gMNm"&gt;The public health measures used to slow the spread of COVID-19 likely helped suppress these viruses over 2020, and they bounced back as communities in the US started to lift some of those restrictions. It’s still not clear exactly how the flu and various cold-causing viruses respond to different strategies used against COVID-19, so the trends in these viruses might be unpredictable over the next year as efforts to fight the pandemic continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSBpUg"&gt;“Clinicians should be aware that respiratory viruses might not exhibit typical seasonal circulation patterns and that a resumption of circulation of certain respiratory viruses is occurring,” the CDC report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IF7M23"&gt;The uptick in viruses that cause the common cold might also make it harder for people and their doctors to differentiate between COVID-19 symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses. During 2020, any cold- or flu-like symptoms were likely to be COVID-19 — it was one of the only viruses around. Now that other viruses are on their way back, the picture could be murkier. &lt;/p&gt;
