    <title>Staples’ Easy Button is a cheap toy that envisions a perfect button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jsXcXQOlCuez_N6APiE8deNAQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727058/akrales_210125_4362_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d115uY"&gt;As buttons go, there are few as well-known as Staples’ “Easy Button” — a bright, Staples-red button that was featured in a series of ad campaigns beginning in 2005. The ads were so popular that Staples ended up actually selling real replica versions of the Easy Button shortly after they debuted — and it’s since sold millions of the desk toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPlfNS"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFRKHOQ4WJE"&gt;fictitious Easy Buttons&lt;/a&gt; featured in the commercials possess magical qualities that allow the user to sorcerously solve their (usually office supply-related) issues with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NojiCsZQSr8"&gt;press of a button&lt;/a&gt;. The sad irony, of course, is that the real-life version of the product is significantly more disappointing. Pressing it doesn’t summon a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzCJP5P0wZU"&gt;rain of printer ink&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8fMF9M67SI&amp;amp;list=PLyDQGD1hoIWdSL1gCH4GPIjv-5WCh8irY&amp;amp;index=11"&gt;raise the Great Wall to defend against an invading army&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it just plays a recording of the company’s “That was easy” slogan when you press down the (satisfyingly clicky) button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o1LHMN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Easy Button aims to be the perfect button&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8NWPx"&gt;Outside of the metafictional context of Staples commercials, though, the idea of a magical big red button that you can press to solve a problem is one that resonates with the entire concept of hardware design. Sure, the real-world Easy Button is just a cute toy to leave on your desk or annoy your co-workers with. But nearly every hardware button that exists is born out of the same ethos as the more magical version from the commercial: it’s a physical object that’s designed for users to press, push, switch, or spin in order to solve a specific problem or accomplish a task. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wg2fDYeQOcy9dOlhwShYaS-NI78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260028/akrales_210125_4362_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4amfjB"&gt;The Easy Button just imagines a world in which our buttons have been elevated to an even higher plane. One where the things that buttons can do or the issues they can alleviate aren’t bounded by petty things like electricity, programming, or the laws of physics. One where no problem is too big or complicated that it can’t be solved with a single push of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVmabk"&gt;But the Easy Button’s journey from marketing gimmick to actual product doesn’t end with a wacky cubicle accessory — because the internet took the initial idea of the Easy Button and ran with it, with any number of tutorials available on how to hack &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FStaples-Easy-Button%2Fproduct_606396&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22250485%2Fstaples-easy-button-toy-commercial-design-user-interface-hack#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $9 toy&lt;/a&gt;. Most common hacks revolve around modding the hardware with a microphone to record your own catchphrases &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scott/the-easiest-easy-button-hack"&gt;for the Easy Button’s&lt;/a&gt; tinny speaker to spout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCZc0w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A button that can do anything with just a push&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6b3zn"&gt;Other hacks go further, like &lt;a href="https://www.partsnotincluded.com/repurposing-the-staples-easy-button/"&gt;installing an Arduino microcontroller&lt;/a&gt; that allows the once-useless button to be hooked up to a computer or custom hardware setup. And with that kind of hardware and some programming chops, the sky’s the limit for what you can have your Easy Button do, like boot up your computer, quit a Zoom call, or even order some more paper from Staples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89PAzX"&gt;It’s still not quite the level of literal magic that Staples promises in its commercials, but after years, the converging forces of a marketing campaign turned into an office toy turned into a DIY tool have come full circle: an infinitely programmable button that can, in theory, do almost anything with just a push. And really, what else could you ask for from a button beyond that?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bowser’s Fury is a heavy metal remix of Super Mario 3D World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-66w1dUg6qbEdvUGVSLbLX4z0k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727035/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_31_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVVMAS"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch, Nintendo is once again giving a great Wii U game a second chance on a more successful platform. But it’s also more than just a straight port. In addition to the main game, this rerelease also includes a separate experience — the titular &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It’s essentially a built-in expansion pack with a strong heavy metal vibe to remix the classic gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9w5rR"&gt;For starters, you don’t actually have to play &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; to access &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;. Both titles are accessible right from the main menu, and you can swap between them at will. Progress in one doesn’t appear to impact the other. Fundamentally, the two games are the same: &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; still plays and controls just like &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which means, yes, you’ll spend lots of time in a cat costume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133098/super-mario-3d-world-review"&gt;The Wii U classic&lt;/a&gt; is best-known for its inventive level design and for finding a nice balance between the open spaces of 3D &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games and the structure of the original side-scrollers, and that’s largely true of &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nPW9Gj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Mario 3D World is the best reason to own a Wii U","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133098/super-mario-3d-world-review"},{"title":"Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a wonderful history lesson ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"},{"title":"Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tK6W4H"&gt;The new expansion is more of a bite-sized take on the formula. It’s set in a world made up of a series of islands, though the main goal is the same as ever, with lots of shiny objects to collect to open up new areas. I’ve only played the first section, which is a sort of island paradise overrun with cats; seriously, everything from the bushes to the birds has adorable cat ears. It’s a little disarming how cute everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aROor7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppkX8epoD9g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="79EtVt"&gt;If you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226787/super-mario-3d-world-release-date-price-new-color-switch"&gt;watched the trailers&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll know that the big change this year really is big: a kaiju-sized Bowser rampaging across the land. In order to get his attention, you have to collect coins and unlock lighthouses littered across the level. (Evil Bowser, naturally, hates light.) When this happens, Mario will similarly grow to epic proportions for a large-scale tilt. I can’t say much about these massive battles just yet — stay tuned to our full review for more on that next month — but they definitely add a new dynamic to an otherwise familiar experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irzv5i"&gt;Aside from boss battles, the other thing Bowser adds is unpredictability. Every so often you’ll start to notice a heavy rain, which precipitates an attack: the world will be covered with dark clouds, and Bowser will let out a barrage of fireballs for a short period. What’s interesting about this is that it doesn’t just add challenge but provides a different way to interact with the world. Some puzzles and secret areas are only accessible — or at least are easier to reach — during one of these brief attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKg2pI"&gt;From what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; feels like just the thing for those picking up &lt;em&gt;3D World &lt;/em&gt;for a second time. It’s essentially a remix of a beloved game, adding in a few fresh ideas while retaining the same core. There are still a handful of questions — like how big it actually is and whether those awe-inspiring battles are any fun — but it at least has the basics down. And alongside the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s helping turn the Switch into the ideal &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjplK4"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches on February 12th for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors, after flubbing its deal with Nikola, eyes a new hydrogen truck project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVYQ3CMWf5ukUoAV49HOpuQklBg=/319x0:3777x2305/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727075/Navistar_Truck_1_with_background5_FINAL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWywLv"&gt;General Motors, which only a few months ago was forced to ditch its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;acquire an equity stake&lt;/a&gt; in troubled hydrogen truck startup Nikola, is ready to move on. Today, the automaker announced it was teaming up with Illinois-based trucking firm Navistar and OneH2, a North Carolina-based hydrogen fuel cell company, to put more hydrogen-powered long-haul trucks on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXSzAd"&gt;The three companies, along with JB Hunt Transport Services, are planning to roll out “a complete solution” for a fleet of heavy-duty, zero-emission, hydrogen fuel cell trucks. The move is &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15257576/hydrogen-fuel-cell-honda-clarity-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2017"&gt;further evidence&lt;/a&gt; that automakers are continuing to place huge bets on hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, despite major fueling limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJugvY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As part of the deal, Navistar will introduce a new fuel cell vehicle in 2024&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jFK4c"&gt;As part of the deal, Navistar will introduce a new fuel cell vehicle in 2024, called the International RH Series truck. Test versions of the truck will roll out prior to that in 2022. The companies are aiming for a fuel cell vehicle with a powertrain capable of “500+ miles” of range and a refueling time of less than 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElysV"&gt;(Tesla has promised that its battery electric Semi truck would be capable of traveling up to 500 miles on a single charge — though that vehicle has yet to enter production.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBo16w"&gt;Here’s how Navistar is describing the International RH Series truck’s propulsion system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LLdt69"&gt;The International RH Series FCEV [fuel cell electric vehicle] will get its energy from two GM Hydrotec fuel cell power cubes. Each Hydrotec power cube contains 300-plus hydrogen fuel cells along with thermal and power management systems. They are compact and easy to package into many different applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MUjnU"&gt;The combined propulsion system within the International RH Series FCEV will feature better power density for short-range travel, better short-burst kW output and a per-mile cost expected to be comparable to diesel in certain market segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0cvT4Q"&gt;Hydrogen fuel cells — which use compressed hydrogen as their fuel and release only water vapor as an emission — have been in development for decades, but only recently have they attained performance and range numbers good enough to replace an average driver’s gasoline-powered car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFzXuR"&gt;That said, hydrogen as a popular fuel source has been stymied by an almost complete lack of a fueling infrastructure. There are currently 39 public hydrogen fueling stations in California (with another 25 in development), along with a couple in Hawaii. The East Coast is trying to get in on the action. A &lt;a href="http://chfcc.org/existing-and-planned-hydrogen-fueling-stations-northeast-us/"&gt;handful of stations&lt;/a&gt; are up and running, and more are in the works in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcuX84"&gt;Experts predict that commercial vehicles, like trucks and forklifts, could benefit more from hydrogen thanks to access to centralized, industrial fueling stations. Other automakers have expressed interest in hydrogen-powered trucks, too. In 2019, Toyota unveiled a fuel cell truck concept as part of a feasibility study by the Port of Los Angeles, which figures in to the port’s efforts to reduce harmful emissions. But the Japanese carmaker has yet to commit to making that concept a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c07OKs"&gt;Nikola has been the biggest example of hydrogen’s promises — and pitfalls. The startup claimed its H2-powered truck will have an operational range of as much as 1,200 miles when it was released in 2020. That never happened, though the company did spend most of last year watching its valuation soar to new heights thanks to the meteoric rise in Tesla’s stock price. As the hype grew, GM announced it would acquire an 11 percent stake in the buzzy company, while also lending a hand with Nikola’s battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131754/nikola-badger-hydrogen-electric-pickup-truck-specs-photos-battery-range"&gt;the Badger pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmdJiY"&gt;That all collapsed when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;published a bombshell report &lt;/a&gt;accusing Nikola of fraud in showcasing its electric vehicle technology. Nikola founder Trevor Milton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;stepped down as board chairman&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;GM ended its equity arrangement&lt;/a&gt; with the company. The two companies still plan on collaborating on fuel cell Class 7 and Class 8 trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9wF0g"&gt;Navistar is a less risky bet for GM. The company &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/09/06/navistar-steps-off-the-bankruptcy-brink-with-volkswagen-partnership/#59e13df1787f"&gt;was on the brink of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, having squandered billions of dollars on a diesel engine that failed to win the approval of the Environmental Protections Agency. After US regulators &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/17/12510610/fuel-efficiency-standards-large-trucks-epa"&gt;announced new rules to reduce carbon emissions from big trucks&lt;/a&gt;, putting pressure on Navistar to find a technology partner, Volkswagen swooped in to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/6/12815174/volkswagen-buys-stake-navistar-trucking-emissions-scandal"&gt;buy a minority stake in the company&lt;/a&gt;. Navistar has since been on more stable footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3nmQJ"&gt;Navistar doesn’t only make trucks — the Lisle, Illinois-based company also owns International Trucks, which encompasses a variety of medium-duty trucks, and IC Bus, which makes buses and commercial vehicles. Last year, the company took an equity stake in TuSimple, a leading autonomous vehicle startup, and announced plans to build a self-driving semi truck that can operate without a human driver on highways and local roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6h6Be"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fejhH8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm announces slimmed-down X-E4 mirrorless camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYUc9on5qrpNKZbaL3x79fF-Ug0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727063/16673938_PT01_X_E4_diagonal_left_XF27mm_silver.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIENK6"&gt;Fujifilm has announced the X-E4, which it describes as the most compact interchangeable-lens camera in its X-series lineup. At 121.3mm x 72.9mm x 32.7mm, it’s more than a centimeter thinner than its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/7/16265570/fuji-x-e3-announced-specs-price-features"&gt;X-E3&lt;/a&gt; from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnETJl"&gt;The X-E series slots into Fujifilm’s lineup as an option for enthusiast photographers who prefer a rangefinder-style design to DSLR-like cameras like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21151718/fujifilm-xt4-announced-specs-pricing-ibis-stabilization-vlogging"&gt;X-T4&lt;/a&gt; but don’t need the optical viewfinder of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20927225/fujifilm-x-pro3-mirrorless-camera-specs-features-hands-on-demo-test-price-availability"&gt;X-Pro3&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, it could be viewed as an interchangeable-lens, EVF-only version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122295/fujifilm-x100v-mirrorless-camera-lcd-announced-features-pricing"&gt;X100V&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWMdLa"&gt;Like the X100V, there’s a 26.1-megapixel X-Trans sensor, dedicated dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation, and a new tilting screen that sits flush against the body. The shutter dial now also has a “P” setting for a fully automatic program mode. The grip on the front of the X-E3 has been completely removed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZkhNfsdA7G3D9TAhDX_Zy1pW9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262639/16673885_PT04_X_E4_top_XF27mm_black.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8S59Ca"&gt;For video, the X-E4 can capture 4K/30fps 4:2:0 8-bit video downsampled from 6K and store it on internal media, or output 4K/30fps 4:2:2 10-bit video over its HDMI port. It’s also capable of 1080p footage at 240fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG0mYg"&gt;The X-E4 will be released in March for $849.95 body-only in black and silver. There’s also a $1,049.95 kit that includes a new version of Fujifilm’s 27mm f/2.8 pancake lens (pictured above); unlike its predecessor, this one is weather-resistant and has an aperture ring. It’ll be available separately in March for $399.95, as will a new $799.99 70-300mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm’s GFX 100S is a 102-megapixel medium format camera for $5,999</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhMBBL_Zi3cqBu5YJYP9-TbOtEU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727039/gfx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="acyaAr"&gt;Fujifilm has announced a new medium format camera, the GFX 100S. This new model is essentially a smaller, more accessible version of the GFX 100, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18636034/fujifilm-gfx100-medium-format-digital-camera-announcement-price-specs-features-hands-on"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt; for $9,999.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etcTgt"&gt;Like the GFX 100, the 100S has a 102-megapixel 43.8 x 32.9mm medium format sensor with 100-percent phase-detection AF coverage. It’s a full 500g lighter, however, and has a few features missing or tweaked: the EVF is no longer interchangeable, for example, and there’s no option for a vertical battery grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evFCoP"&gt;The in-body OIS system is smaller and lighter, but Fujifilm actually says it should slightly outperform the GFX 100’s with up to six stops of stabilization for most lenses. This is all thanks to an upgraded gyro sensor and improved algorithms, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/au5IOU1-xWmli7xBmVJ4eNsCwrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262647/600022058_PT06_GFX100S_top.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8JxXOJ"&gt;Overall, the GFX 100S’ body is 30 percent smaller than the GFX 100’s. The controls now feature a traditional DSLR-style PASM dial, as well as the virtual dials that can be displayed on the 1.8-inch monochrome display on the top plate. The camera has USB-C and Micro HDMI ports, two UHS-II SD card slots, a 2.5mm remote release, and two 3.5mm sockets for microphones and headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYpbAP"&gt;The GFX 100S will be available in March for $5,999.95. Fujifilm is also releasing a new medium format lens that month, an 80mm f/1.7 that should do a little to address concerns over the lack of fast options for the GFX system. It’ll sell for $2,299.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Medium is slow-burning psychological horror on the Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cnraWdbbFYXVzmEPi4elBzwthE=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727087/TheMedium_Sadness_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It can be clunky, but a chilling, gruesome atmosphere makes it work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5YZBjA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; is a game about a person who is able to live in two worlds, experiencing the realms of the living and the dead at the same time. Developed by the same team behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20847363/blair-witch-horror-game-bloober-team-pc-xbox-review"&gt;the 2019 adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Blair Witch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not an especially original concept, as games have toyed with light and dark worlds as far back as the early &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; titles. But it’s presented in a way that’s just about&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;perfect for a video game: you can wander through both realms simultaneously, controlling two versions of the character as if you were in split-screen multiplayer. It’s a clever and fascinating way of experiencing the story, and — alongside a truly haunting atmosphere — it elevates what would otherwise be a relatively trite and clunky psychological horror experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do4XTU"&gt;At the outset, Marianne is mourning the loss of her adoptive father in a way specific to her particular skill set as a medium: she not only helps with funeral arrangements, she also guides his spirit so he’s able to cross over. It’s a great setup that immediately shows how she’s able to somehow be in two places at once. Almost immediately after, she receives a phone call from a strange man urging her to visit an abandoned hotel, where it’s rumored a horrific massacre happened. Totally normal request. Trusting her gut, Marianne decides to check things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyMcMr"&gt;At its most basic, &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; plays like a third-person adventure game. You explore small, incredibly detailed spaces, collecting items and solving puzzles. It’s the kind of game where most doors are locked or missing handles, so you can’t get through until you find the right item. Many of the puzzles are fairly simple — at any given point, you only have a handful of items in your inventory — and movement can be clunky and slow, reminiscent of the original &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; games. It’s also the rare big-budget game that’s light on action: even though you’re thrown into plenty of dangerous situations, you won’t have a gun or other weapons for defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yZzpQWaHcwLUfegI_Jr7TTyHm0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261611/TheMedium_2Worlds_Lobby_logo_caption.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx4kky"&gt;It may sound a bit dry, but there are a few things that elevate &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt;. The first is the dual-world conceit. At times, you’re in the normal world, and at other times, you’re in the spirit realm — but when the game is at its best, you’re in both. The two worlds are mirrors of each other: the basic layout is the same, but the vibe is very different. A regular hotel lobby might be filled with pulsating tentacles in the spirit world or maybe there’s a door made out of human skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qZ9lW"&gt;But while the two spaces are largely the same, there are some slight differences. This is where most of the puzzles come in, as you have to figure out how to bypass an obstacle in one world in order to progress in both. For instance, one of the earliest has you trying to get to the second floor of a hotel even though, in the human world, the stairs have been destroyed and the elevator’s out. In order to do this, Marianne has to gather up some energy from the spirit realm — she has a handful of very convenient abilities — and use it to power the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="vm4Cfc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10304504"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="baE4iC"&gt;Things start out simple like this, but they get more complex as the game moves along. Later, you’ll be swapping between worlds, using magical mirrors and other mystical objects to manipulate the space around you. My favorite puzzle has you moving objects around a dollhouse to navigate the remains of a crumbling home in the real world. &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; also uses the split screens to great effect in cutscenes, as you can see the story playing out in both worlds; sometimes when Marianne confronts a spirit or monster, her real-world avatar does the same actions without anyone else present, Tyler Durden style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dltYF4"&gt;Really, the entirety of &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; has this slow burn. For the first few hours, it verges on  generic, with a confusing story and simple puzzles. But as the narrative starts to pick up, the game becomes much more interesting. Marianne learns more about her past and the origins of her spiritual powers, and there are lots of great “ah-ha!” moments when things click into place. Likewise, the puzzles become more complex as you become adjusted to the reality of parallel worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKKOKASdnxp--ybE_vAB7c6kbRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261614/TheMedium_2Worlds_Thomas_Office_logo_caption.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NPqtnI"&gt;But while the story and puzzles take a while to get going, the one consistent in &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; is its chilling atmosphere. This isn’t an action game where monsters are constantly coming after you. Instead, it’s more of a creeping dread. Almost all of the areas you’ll be exploring are small and oppressive — even the real-world versions. That could be the burned-out skeletal remains of a home, with only a few surviving objects — naturally, there are lots of creepy dolls — or an underworld with twisted bodies fused to the wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mRSn"&gt;It can be fascinating wandering around and seeing how the two worlds differ. Other times, it’s just gruesome. And adding to the sense of dread is the only real enemy, a giant monster that stalks you throughout the game, leading to a number of tense stealth sequences. (In a nice touch, there’s a button to make Marianne hold her breath and be quiet, and you can actually feel her thumping heartbeat through the controller.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PBCqVE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt; lasts around 10 hours, which is just the right length for the story to wrap up nicely. It even ends on an &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;-style cliffhanger, where what actually happens is fairly ambiguous. (I can’t wait to have people to talk about it with.) But in terms of gameplay ideas, it does end rather abruptly: just as the game starts finding really interesting ways to play with the dual-world structure, it’s over. The last few hours are far and away the most interesting, and I wish the rest of the game was as inventive. The multiworld premise isn’t quite a game-changer, but it adds just enough to make this psychological thriller worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAznV2"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Medium &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches January 28th on PC and Xbox Series X and S, and it’ll also be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bond film delays are reportedly causing product placement havoc for brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvjb3ZQpmF0-RPwdzmuf2X3Js8Q=/0x0:893x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726980/gsmarena_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image featuring Daniel Craig using an HMD device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0IsE2s"&gt;The latest James Bond movie’s pandemic-related delays are reportedly causing problems for its marketing deals, with advertisers concerned that the film may end up featuring outdated product placements, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13847637/james-bond-re-shoots-product-placement-deals/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The 25th Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, is currently due to release in cinemas on October 8th, over a year after it was originally meant to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAJpek"&gt;“Some of those things were the very latest models back when they started filming” a source told &lt;em&gt;The Sun, &lt;/em&gt;“but by the time the movie comes out now it will look like Daniel Craig and all of the other cast members are carrying something that has been out for ages. That isn’t really the point of these deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2JULk"&gt;Although the film will reportedly feature Omega watches, Bollinger champagne, and Adidas footwear, it seems likely that HMD Global’s Nokia phones are at risk of dating most quickly. HMD Global announced last year that the film &lt;a href="https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/one-epic-shoot"&gt;would include its Nokia 8.3 5G&lt;/a&gt; from last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the film is also set to include the Nokia 7.2, which was first released in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxVBgJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMQ7JEk-Ydw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQsdlE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that the movie could face reshoots to hide its outdated products, and quotes a source as saying that some scenes may be “carefully edited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNPAB1"&gt;“The big tech firms want the stars to have all the new up-and-coming products to help promote them and sell them to fans,” the source tells &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. “It means some of the scenes are going to have to be very carefully edited and looked at to bring things up to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uz1wHN"&gt;We may have already seen an example of this kind of editing at work. Although one of the film’s stars, Lashana Lynch, appears to be using a Nokia 8.3 5G in the ad above (note the camera flash to the left of the array), a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM3kPYj_Grw"&gt;previous version released in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; seems to feature a Nokia 5.3, complete with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and headphone jack on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O862jl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; was originally due to release in April 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;delayed to November&lt;/a&gt; last year after the pandemic forced cinemas around the world to close. The film was subsequently delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;to April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;then to October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Provided no more delays happen, the movie is currently slated to release around a year and a half after its original planned debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3GDv"&gt;Thankfully for HMD, there’s at least one phone in the film that’s unlikely to date too much. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; will also feature a classic Nokia 3310, a phone that originally released way back in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVCS6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS5SeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU group calls for Nintendo Switch Joy-Con drift investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q882RJw3ztuag1IOXsBzxSMnXWM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726936/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AtEi8"&gt;The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) is calling on the European Commission to investigate Nintendo Joy-Con drift complaints. The BEUC group represents more than 40 consumer organizations across the European Union, and the umbrella organization says it has received nearly 25,000 complaints from consumers across Europe about faulty Joy-Con controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSC626"&gt;“According to consumer testimonies, in 88 percent of cases, the game controllers broke within the first two years of use,” &lt;a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-launches-europe-wide-complaint-against-nintendo-premature-obsolescence/html"&gt;says the BEUC&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-27-after-25k-complaints-eu-calls-for-investigation-into-nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The group has now submitted a complaint to the European Commission claiming Nintendo is involved in premature obsolescence and “misleading omissions of key consumer information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pdQkx"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;reporting issues with the console’s removable Joy-Con controllers&lt;/a&gt; ever since its launch nearly four years ago. Most of the reports have centered around strange joystick drifting problems that create false inputs. Nintendo will repair the drifting Joy-Con controllers for free, but even the refreshed Switch models are experiencing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cgJm6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con drift problem, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C7ZzY5"&gt;“BEUC and its members are very concerned about Nintendo continuing to sell a product that was continuously reported to Nintendo and in the media by consumers as failing prematurely,” says Ursula Pachl, deputy director general at the BEUC, in a letter to the European Commission. “The obsolescence of the product means that consumers often have to buy a new set of game controllers after a short time, also because of the unproportionate costs and the practical burdens that consumers would face when trying to exercise repairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0GxDm"&gt;The European Commission will now need to decide whether to open up a formal investigation into the Joy-Con drift issues. Nintendo is also facing two potential class action lawsuits. One was &lt;a href="https://chimicles.com/cskd-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-nintendo-of-america-inc-relating-to-joy-con-drifting-issues/"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; by law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner &amp;amp; Donaldson-Smith in 2019, and a second was &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-joy-con-lawsuit/"&gt;filled in California&lt;/a&gt; over the same issue in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The bike arrives at a time when many people want to work out at home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sOTOiJ"&gt;Last year was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the year sweatpants become acceptable workwear, and the year Peloton peaked. Mid-pandemic, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427003/peloton-new-treadmill-bike-plus-exercise-equipment-features-price"&gt;announced two new devices&lt;/a&gt;: the pricier Bike Plus and a less expensive treadmill called the Tread. The Bike Plus started shipping in September and includes significant updates to the company’s signature hardware during an especially critical time when many people have shifted their fitness routines from gyms into their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbsdg"&gt;I, for years, have been a dedicated Crunch gym-goer, usually taking five classes a week. But with gyms closing off and on and classes generally being canceled, I moved my routine indoors. First, I started with Peloton’s app workouts, using resistance bands and bodyweight. I then switched to Zoom classes taught by an instructor I enjoy from Crunch. For the past few months, I’ve been testing Peloton’s Bike Plus. To put it simply: I’ve loved my time with the Bike Plus. It’s become an important tool for my well-being. Anytime I need to sweat out stress or transition my day from work into leisure, the bike is my go-to. Peloton has built a truly reliable spin bike, but at $2,495, the price is still hard for me to accept, especially considering its ecosystem lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MK681C"&gt;The main thing to keep in mind when assessing Peloton’s products is that you’re paying solely for new hardware. The Peloton software remains the same across both the old and new internet-connected bikes, similar to how most old and new iPhones receive the current iOS. You can also access that app content without any official Peloton equipment. To get people to upgrade, though, Peloton has to offer real hardware innovation in order to justify the Bike Plus’ nearly $2,500 price versus the original bike’s $1,895 cost. This time around, for the extra $600, riders get a new swiveling display, a fresh speaker system, automatic resistance calibration, and Apple Watch GymKit support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bv3MId"&gt;Before fully assessing the bike investment, though, let’s first break the Bike Plus down by what’s new and how those features work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZVhsT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10291963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Cuqh0A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THAT SWIVEL DISPLAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUSPnm"&gt;The most obvious change with the Bike Plus is the new 23.8-inch HD touchscreen. The prior model included a 21.5-inch HD touchscreen with thick bezels on all sides. It effectively looked like an iMac bolted to a stationary bike. The Bike Plus places a speaker across the top of the display, augmenting those bezels. To be clear: there are definitely still bezels on the new display, but they feel unobtrusive. It’s a massive screen solely for workout content, and your attention is firmly planted at the center of the screen most of the time. However, for a display this size and at this high of a cost, its lack of an ambient light sensor is questionable. I work out at various hours of the day but particularly love an evening ride in a dark room. The screen should dim itself rather than me having to manually do so. (There’s a camera at the top of the display for video calls with friends, so it could easily detect light.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Xwqy"&gt;As for the new swivel function, the main idea is people can take Peloton’s floor classes without having to uncomfortably stand behind their bikes. You can swivel the display out and away from the bike to face the rest of the room, allowing you to move around to complete yoga, strength, or meditation classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otfays"&gt;Peloton also launched a new class format, called Bike Bootcamp, to coincide with this bike’s release. The bootcamp is designed to give cyclers a chance to do it all — bike and strength train within the same class — without having to complete two separate workouts. And while the swivel display makes this option feasible, I still found these classes difficult to pull off for the first few weeks, namely because of the Peloton cycling shoes. When you ride on a Peloton, you clip into the bike with cycling shoes, and these shoes take time to clip out of the pedals, which requires lots of practice. For context, the Peloton employee who delivered my bike recommended leaving my shoes in the pedals and slipping my foot in and out to avoid a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yrv8r4"&gt;Bike Bootcamp classes expect you to clip in and out to complete various portions of the class, which took me a while to get used to doing. Adding to the quick transition stress was the lack of a pause button, meaning that I often missed the demo portion of the strength routine and fell behind. Peloton says the missing pause button is because the bike is “designed to give you a great workout and ensure that you work as hard as you would in a live indoor cycling class,” but in a home context, it’s more of a pain than anything else. You can exit the class, but this means you’ll have to reenter it, which takes a while and is annoying to do. And if you accidentally tap that you want to restart the class entirely, there’s no forward or back button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoBuH4"&gt;I also found the angling of the display to be slightly off. Working out on a mat means you want the display to tip as far down as possible to provide a good view of the content. But this display doesn’t angle far enough down, meaning I had to crane my neck to see the instructor. This didn’t prevent me from using the screen for mat workouts, but it did annoy me (and kind of hurt!) at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWH9Ka"&gt;Still, the swivel is an essential upgrade, especially if you use your bike’s display as your main one for other workouts. I don’t have a TV, so I need the swivel, but Peloton also offers a &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041841611-How-Do-I-Get-Peloton-Classes-On-My-TV-"&gt;suite of options&lt;/a&gt; for broadcasting to a TV, including a Roku app, Fire TV app, and AirPlay and Cast compatibility. If you have any of these options available to you in your home gym, the swivel screen likely won’t do much for you and isn’t worth the upgrade cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BiBiABtEGGL5uBZKDkJ5QXlGt_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233857/akrales210108_4344_0103.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f9gaFI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NEW SPEAKER SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfiyau"&gt;The new bike comes with 26-watt, front-facing stereo speakers, as well as woofers that face away from you. The prior bike only included rear-facing stereo speakers. The new speakers sound great, although I preferred to bike with Bluetooth-paired wireless earbuds. (There’s also a headphone jack for anyone who might want wired options.) Peloton lets you select between different audio mixes, either prioritizing the music, the instructor, or finding a balance between the two in the original mix. I always work out with the music prioritized and when I do this through my AirPods Pro, I have no problem also hearing the instructor. But when I listen through the speaker, I find the music mix to be almost unusable; I sometimes can’t hear the instructor at all and miss my cues. The music is loud and sounds fantastic, which is perhaps what Peloton wanted, but finding the perfect balance between thumping music and hearing directions was complicated. (I’ll also note here that the bike is remarkably silent. My roommate would ride next to my bedroom door, and I couldn’t hear anything apart from his breathing. It’s a great bike for a shared home where people want to exist in their own spaces.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f31vmS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTOMATIC RESISTANCE DETECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2taNZa"&gt;This feature is undeniably cool. Typically, in a spin class, the instructor offers a range within which the riders should aim to set their resistance level. Spinners reach down to their resistance knob and turn it to the desired resistance whenever a new range is called out. The Bike Plus now adjusts the resistance automatically. It’s slick and convenient and absolutely the neatest feature of the Bike Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wplIhZ"&gt;I did encounter some bugs, though. Sometimes the cues were off, either with the resistance setting itself between a different range than the instructor called out, the timing of that resistance change being off, or the resistance dropping at times when it should have stayed consistent or even increased. This seemed to happen more frequently in older archive classes than new ones. With that said, though, the few times I ran into this problem weren’t a huge issue. I adjusted the knob myself and waited for the bike to catch the next instruction. I still find this feature hugely helpful, allowing me to concentrate more on the class rather than adjusting the knob to get to the right resistance, especially during climbs when the resistance can go up suddenly during an energy push.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3VRwv8ozP_jIknCUUM5xS3PH-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233856/akrales210108_4344_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DLisKi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APPLE WATCH GYMKIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uIy6SR"&gt;The Bike Plus is also the first device from Peloton to directly integrate with the Apple Watch through GymKit. I had a couple of problems with this functionality at first: the Watch wouldn’t pair with the bike, but then Peloton issued an update which seemed to correct the issue. Only one other time did I have a problem with pairing and had to restart my Apple Watch. Although these issues only came up a couple of times, they were particularly upsetting because when the bike is paired with the Apple Watch, your heart rate shows up on-screen during a workout, which I look to monitor as I’m moving through a class. With the Apple Watch paired, workouts are also tracked in Apple’s Health app with all the bike’s own data taken into account, like energy output, so the functionality not working 100 percent of the time is frustrating and actively takes away from my exercise. But on the whole, it’s remained mostly reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SuwXG"&gt;The watch only directly syncs with the bike for spin or bike bootcamp workouts, meaning you won’t be able to see your heart-rate on the screen while you complete a strength or pilates class, for example. This isn’t great and feels like it defeats the purpose of having GymKit compatibility in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="higHxH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS THIS THE BIKE FOR YOU?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqfs5U"&gt;The Bike Plus is an expensive, tough sell for Peloton and one that needs to be pulled off flawlessly, especially as new software competitors, like Apple Fitness Plus, enter the market, as well as cheaper hardware competitors like Echelon and Bowflex. The Bike Plus feels like the iPhone of spin bikes — it’s intuitive to use and works right out of the box. (But actually, there is no box because Peloton offers white glove delivery and setup with every purchase.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X8sBk"&gt;For the person who doesn’t want to fiddle with a bike that isn’t totally built for Peloton’s software, meaning it doesn’t monitor output and all the other fancy fitness metrics, Peloton’s bikes are tempting. But buying one means committing to a $39-per-month subscription. The app itself only costs $12 per month but doesn’t include multi-account support, live classes, the leaderboard, and full metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDqAwg"&gt;For some people, that $39 is a savings compared to what they used to spend for gym access, especially considering it provides access to an unlimited number of different profiles. For others, it’s a significant investment in their health and life. Either way, you’re committing to Peloton and its subscription plan forever. The display is useless without the subscription, meaning if you ever wanted to try Apple Fitness Plus or SoulCycle or any other on-demand cycling classes, you’d have to ignore the massive display and instead get a TV or laptop to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDI7K0MIG6xmgDlIIGXHy9URafg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233851/akrales210108_4344_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MGRmJ3"&gt;As much as I loved my time with the Bike Plus, the high price and software lock-in is difficult to accept. Peloton has built undeniably great hardware. I just wish I could use it with any software I liked rather than only Peloton’s app. If I had a TV, this might bother me less because I’d plan to use whatever fitness app I liked on my TV and wouldn’t sweat losing the subscription. Although, of course, I’d then be saddled with a massive HD display that literally does nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41wJwr"&gt;The question of whether I’d recommend this bike depends on how much you love Peloton’s classes and how much you want to work for your exercise bike. Other spin bikes exist, many of which are cheaper and allow you to swap in your own tablet. You can even use Peloton’s app with them, albeit with some compromises, like losing your place on Peloton’s competitive leaderboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1DANN"&gt;There’s also Peloton’s notorious delivery delays to consider. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/business/peloton-slow-delivery.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that buyers’ delivery dates are being rescheduled day-of with the actual equipment showing up months after the date they were first quoted. All of this is to say, if you’re considering this bike purely for pandemic workouts, prepare to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R2Oe8"&gt;Still, to me, the Bike Plus is a must-get for anyone who lives the true Peloton lifestyle and sees themselves loving the company and its software far into the future. It’s reliable, works well, and, broadly, my gripes didn’t take away from the experience; I’ve been riding nearly daily for months now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Db1WCH"&gt;I just can’t predict whether I’ll want to go back to the gym post-pandemic or if I’ll get used to working out at home indefinitely. To Peloton’s credit, however, I can’t imagine myself readily giving this bike back; it’ll hurt a little to watch it leave. That feels like a victory for the brand and an admission for me that I do want a Peloton bike in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is first with new power efficient OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X05E1VQO6Wexse-pPTai86o76kU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726594/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQ5yMC"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagship, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is its first phone to feature Samsung Display’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005831/en/Samsung-Display-Unveils-New-Low-power-OLED-Display-for-Smartphones/"&gt;new power-efficient OLED panels&lt;/a&gt;. In a press release, Samsung says the new display consumes 16 percent less power thanks to a “just-developed organic material” that means “electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz8udY"&gt;“In other words,” Samsung explains, the technology means its “OLED panels can create brighter light while consuming less power, which improves the battery lifetime.” A smartphone’s display is typically one of its most power-hungry components, so efficiency gains here can have a big impact on the overall battery life of the device. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we remarked that the S21 Ultra has excellent battery life that lasts “beyond a full day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OYpiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="58fMXQ"&gt;Samsung confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the S21 Ultra uses an LTPO (aka a &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) display, but it’s not the first of Samsung’s phones to do so. Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1334"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra also used LTPO display panels, which Samsung brands as HOP (Hybrid Oxide and Polycrystalline silicon). However, this week’s announcement says the S21 Ultra is the “first” to use the more efficient panels, suggesting Samsung Display has further refined the technology compared to the Note 20 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyJDW9"&gt;Prior to appearing in smartphones, LTPO displays have been used in smart watches. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Apple Watch Series 4 featured an LTPO display produced by LG, while Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 used an LTPO display produced by Samsung Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONy3Zk"&gt;If reports are accurate, Apple’s next flagship iPhones could soon benefit from Samsung Display’s power-efficient panel technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the South Korean company is in line to supply LTPO panels for Apple’s 2021 iPhones. According to the report, Apple will use 120Hz LTPO OLED displays in two of its four iPhones in the second half of the year, while the other two will have more traditional OLED panels. &lt;/p&gt;
