    <title>Valheim is Steam’s hottest new PC game, and it’s now sold 3 million copies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday February 19th, two days after we originally published this post, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;it hit 3 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlvYZS"&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="an0GTw"&gt;By Friday, it took the #9 spot with 410,000 players, pulling &lt;em&gt;Postal &lt;/em&gt;down one rung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3l7Vk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 19th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim has now sold 3 million copies and is now has a new record for the ninth-most simultaneous players at any one moment on Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned how the Daft Punk robot helmets were created</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9_Dpvk7pmX8UtjpmWkuB8lnZuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845901/acastro_210219_4434_daftPunk_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Images by Daft Punk, Alex and Martin, and Alterian Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CxncBL"&gt;As a visual artist who also makes beats in the anonymity of my bedroom, I’ve always wondered how Daft Punk managed to craft not only their music, but their visual presence. A masterpiece unto itself, the Daft Punk helmets transform two anonymous musicians into otherworldly beings. Arbiters of funk and electro. Ambassadors of sound. Gods of the synthesizer. You get it. The helmets allow the musicians to detach themselves from reality and bring the audience into their universe. It leaves the musician in mystery, and until today, the genesis of the helmets was a mystery to me too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbaORk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daft_Wub/status/1362285526435340288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1362285526435340288%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;In a tweet thread by @daft_wub&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the whole process from sketch to final, including electrical schematics and initial sculpts of the helmets. They also show the complex wiring that was required to power the matrix of LEDs, as well as behind-the-scenes images from Daft Punk’s very first photo shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P4xuzf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The creation of the original Daft Punk robots. A thread. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Byuo6yjic2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Byuo6yjic2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daft Punk Fandom   (@Daft_Wub) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daft_Wub/status/1362285526435340288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="flEgXj"&gt;The thread also credits the companies involved: Alterian Inc., which did work on the first version of the helmets, and Ironhead Studios, which worked on the latest and slimmest versions of our favorite funk bots. Both studios have experience in film; Ironhead Studios in particular has worked with Marvel on live-action costumes for characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Thanos, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6sIiG8"&gt;These images aren’t new; the tweet thread is simply recirculating them, but this is great for fans like me who’ve never really seen the process. If you want to learn more, I suggest reading &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnyekw/daft-punk-birth-of-robots"&gt;this article by Piers Martin&lt;/a&gt;, based on an extensive 2000 interview of the duo originally conducted for &lt;em&gt;The Face&lt;/em&gt;. You can even read a full annotated transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NN2IXs"&gt;And for bonus material, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtjucCWeOf4&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt; with Alterian SFX Designer Tony Gardner exploring various iterations of the suits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest news and trailers from Blizzcon 2021’s opening keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dFwmxY_jZ9t8ReGd3kbuz0L9Yc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845804/Diablo_II_Char_Select_Act1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hZCJrv"&gt;Blizzcon happened a little later than usual due to the pandemic, but the first virtual version of Blizzard’s games convention still had some interesting news and trailers. The opening keynote covered most of the big franchises, like &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, along with some more obscure classics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bXQ35"&gt;If you missed the event, you can catch up on all of the biggest news right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="I0LOZz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291771/blizzard-arcade-collection-announced-blizzcon-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E6sHSD"&gt;The first announcement was one of the most unexpected: three of Blizzard’s more obscure games are being bundled into a new package called the &lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lost Vikings, Rock &amp;amp; Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne &lt;/em&gt;have all been ported to modern platforms, including PC, Xbox One, PS4, and the Nintendo Switch. And they include some handy features, like save states and a virtual museum. The best part? The collection is out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ6PH9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LvrLZ4yETHI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6MIdJz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285611/diablo-4-blizzcon-2021-trailer-rogue-class"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4yCsWV"&gt;Diablo IV is still some ways away — Blizzard has already said it won’t be launching this year — but we at least got a glimpse of what to expect thanks to a new trailer that unveiled the rogue class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhXmOu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRP62MGOrUo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0dqJyV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291766/diablo-2-resurrected-remaster-blizzcon-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="My83ua"&gt;If you prefer an older-style of demonic dungeon crawling, Blizzard also officially unveiled &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;, an HD remaster of the nearly two decade-old game. It’s coming out this year for both PC and console, with versions for the Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’ll even include cross-progression between console and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="1j7Jfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hn1KPO"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft Classic&lt;/em&gt; players, Blizzard revealed that the game’s next big adventure will be the “Burning Crusade.” There’s no word on when exactly it’ll launch, but Blizzard says “the Dark Portal reopens 2021.” For the main game, there’s also a new chapter for the &lt;em&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/em&gt; expansion on the way, called “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1362889402612133891"&gt;Chains of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="VzzgEs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bKSpq9"&gt;During a presentation after the main keynote, Blizzard unveiled some new information about &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;. There are two new maps, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902203875303427"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902483081719808"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, weather effects like &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362905194460106754"&gt;sandstorms and snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906847770906625"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362907402790608898"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906606124503040"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362908431691116547"&gt;redesigned looks&lt;/a&gt; for Widowmaker, Reaper, McCree, and Pharah.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo II is getting remastered for console and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAYTtt9jYFghX2H6VERDG2jGZZ4=/145x0:1767x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845709/screenshot__170_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7HhRi5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big overhaul in a new remaster. After &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/25/22248563/diablo-2-remake-release-dates-pc-blizzard-vicarious-visions-activision-report"&gt;a few leaks&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt; at its online-only edition of Blizzcon 2021. The new version of the game — which first launched back in 2000 — will launch this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, with cross-progression between PC and console. The HD remaster will include both the base game and its expansion, &lt;em&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R1N5Dr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;                              &lt;br&gt;          Arise,                        &lt;br&gt;               Diablo,     &lt;br&gt;   Lord         &lt;br&gt;                of              &lt;br&gt;                      Terror.&lt;br&gt;                   &lt;br&gt;                             &lt;br&gt;                       &lt;a href="https://t.co/76kxCCMv51"&gt;pic.twitter.com/76kxCCMv51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Diablo (@Diablo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1362896494622294017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNiclb"&gt;The announcement comes at a surprisingly busy time for the long running action-RPG series. In addition to the remaster of &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;, Blizzard is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the next full-fledged title, &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySwr6n"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is too modern for your tastes, the original game is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254558/diablo-classic-digital-gog-blizzard-windows-10-purchase"&gt;still available on GOG.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fires second AI ethics researcher following internal investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lvzPJnQ4c-p1vA3D6ORlez-a6tI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845702/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VFz7TL"&gt;Google has fired Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, after she used an automated script to look through her emails in order to find evidence of discrimination against her coworker Timnit Gebru. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-fires-another-ai-ethics-leader-6ef7dcd5-4583-4396-b5b3-129547ff3091.html"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfxfna"&gt;Mitchell’s firing comes one day after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;announced a reorganization to its AI teams&lt;/a&gt; working on ethics and fairness. Marian Croak, a vice president in the engineering organization, is now leading “a new center of expertise on responsible AI within Google Research,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gvV6yD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These decisions were made behind our backs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxgjl7"&gt;Mitchell joined Google in 2016 as a senior research scientist, according to her LinkedIn. Two years later, she helped start the ethical AI team alongside Gebru, a renowned researcher known for her work on bias in facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbfa9w"&gt;In December 2020, Mitchell and Gebru were working on a paper about the dangers of large language processing models when Megan Kacholia, vice president of Google Brain, asked that the article be retracted. Gebru pushed back, saying the company needed to be more open about why the research wasn’t acceptable. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;she was fired&lt;/a&gt;, though Google characterized her departure as a resignation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JZWbr"&gt;After Gebru’s termination, Mitchell became openly critical of Google executives, including Google AI division head Jeff Dean and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In January, she lost her corporate email access after Google began investigating her activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLL1Su"&gt;“After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees,” Google said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;about Mitchell’s firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DKnrA"&gt;On Friday, Google announced it was making changes to its research and diversity policies, following an investigation into Gebru’s termination. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291631/google-diversity-research-policy-changes-timnet-gebru-firing"&gt;In an internal email&lt;/a&gt;, Jeff Dean apologized to staff for how Gebru’s departure was handled. “I heard and acknowledge what Dr. Gebru’s exit signified to female technologists, to those in the Black community and other underrepresented groups who are pursuing careers in tech, and to many who care deeply about Google’s responsible use of AI. It led some to question their place here, which I regret,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13Pv0K"&gt;The ethical AI team has been in crisis since Gebru’s firing in December. After the reorganization announcement yesterday, senior researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhanna/status/1362477638749626369"&gt;Alex Hanna wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the team was not aware of Croak’s appointment until the news broke publicly Wednesday night. “We were told to trust the process, trust in decision-makers like Marian Croak to look out for our best interests,” she said on Twitter. “But these decisions were made behind our backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx2EGt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv1Nbs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVQcYk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV’s latest trailer unveils the rogue class</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q30MkFRCycfmeqLFxQgJ4VaeaM4=/130x0:967x558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845651/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_5.44.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJMwlk"&gt;At Blizzcon 2021, Blizzard revealed the latest glimpse at its upcoming RPG &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;. The cinematic trailer introduced a previously-unannounced character class to the game: the rogue. The other already-announced classes are barbarian, sorceress, and druid. The trailer also provided a nice look at the game’s dark atmosphere, getting particularly gruesome towards the end. You might not want to pierce your ears after watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWmHGz"&gt;Before the virtual convention Blizzard made sure to temper expectations by announcing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;neither &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; would be releasing this year&lt;/a&gt;. The action role-playing game has been much-anticipated for some time, as it was originally announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;way back at the 2019 edition of Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHoF8C"&gt;Meanwhile, Blizzard is also hoping to expand the franchise’s reach with an upcoming mobile adaptation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291766/diablo-2-resurrected-remaster-blizzcon-2021"&gt;remaster of Diablo II&lt;/a&gt; for PC and various consoles including the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ex-Google engineer Anthony Levandowski has closed his artificial intelligence church</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Levandowski In Court For Bond Hearing After Being Charged With Stealing Google Trade Secrets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjdIjNSnW1Lp6E_OZUAOhtI7MCo=/0x63:4194x2859/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845574/1172284878.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPxfhD"&gt;Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer convicted of stealing self-driving car secrets, is closing his artificial intelligence-focused church Way of the Future (WOTF), &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a somewhat inauspicious end to the church’s goal of pursuing “the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” in preparation for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"&gt;the Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. Now humanity will be left to deal with rampant AI without the religion’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3QDR"&gt;Levandowski started the process of shuttering WOTF in June 2020, according to documents filed in the state of California found by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. WOTF never had regular meetings or a physical church building. The church’s funds, totaling $175,172, have been donated to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tIEwP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Way of the Future is a thing of the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="83DlSm"&gt;Owning and operating an AI church is really just one piece of the larger Levandowski story, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has covered as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965974/uber-waymo-self-driving-car-lawsuit-news"&gt;the legal saga between Uber and Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. Levandowski worked on autonomous vehicles at Google, then started his own self-driving trucking company Otto, which he later sold to Uber. At some point in the journey from Google to Uber, Levandowski took some internal documents from the search giant, leading to Google suing Uber in 2017 and settling in 2018. Levandowski was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354906/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-lawsuit-sentence-18-months-prison-lawsuit"&gt;convicted of trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSrVBK"&gt;Levandowski was sentenced to a shortened 18 months in prison to be served following the pandemic, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240175/trump-pardons-anthony-levandowski-google-uber-waymo-trade-secrets"&gt;pardoned by former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; before he left office. With Way of the Future a thing of the past, no prison sentence to serve, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146339/anthony-levandowski-self-driving-car-cross-country-co-pilot-pronto-uber-waymo"&gt;another autonomous driving company&lt;/a&gt; to oversee, Levandowski seems like he can wait for AI to surpass humans in relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard Arcade Collection bundles three of the studio’s more obscure classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qa3vV4MWu_A6eJTXosFca9h92pA=/172x0:1749x1051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845484/Screenshot__156_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JQr7S"&gt;As part of BlizzCon Online’s opening ceremony, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new video game anthology that includes some of the earlier titles created by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer. &lt;a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/en-CA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a compilation featuring three titles developed by Blizzard around the early and mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH1OnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; includes &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, a puzzle platformer that was originally released on SNES in 1993, back when the studio was known as Silicon &amp;amp; Synapse. The game would also see previous ports on other consoles like the Amiga and Game Boy Advance, and was even made available on PC &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/3/5678044/the-lost-vikings-free-blizzard-deal"&gt;as a free download on Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF6V9D"&gt;The other games available include another platformer called &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne&lt;/em&gt;, which was released originally in 1994 on the SNES, as well as &lt;em&gt;Rock n’ Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, a vehicular combat racer. And just like &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings,&lt;/em&gt; both titles would make their way onto &lt;a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download?show=classic"&gt;Blizzard’s digital storefront as free titles&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and 2014, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgNnXt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

Both Chun-Li and Ryu will be available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game shop on Saturday, February 20th at 7PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1EWB9"&gt;Chun-Li and Ryu aren’t the first video game stars to appear in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this season — fans have also had the chance to pick up skins based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos from &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXE3H7"&gt;This entire season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been jam-packed with other crossovers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fortnitegame/status/1337245726477348865?lang=en"&gt;two characters from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;soccer kits from real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;even the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; (who is absolutely adorable in-game). And the game’s last season was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;huge Marvel-themed crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NhmWW"&gt;As unexpected as Chun-Li and Ryu’s arrivals may be, they’re just another reminder that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audeze Penrose gaming headset nails almost everything except for comfort</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great sound, full of features, but the fit might be a deal-breaker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SiQb3F"&gt;The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that’s easily superior to other models I’ve tested recently. It’s feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, the option for wired connectivity via 3.5mm, as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it’s stacked — which it should be for something that costs $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXjG6j"&gt;After reviewing a headset, I usually can’t wait to return to the familiar, plushy, warm-sounding cans of my own Sony WH-1000XM3, but the Penrose is a joy to listen to. Game audio sounds punchy without being over-delivered, I don’t need to blast the volume to hear subtle details, and even though this headset doesn’t have active noise cancellation, I was almost convinced it did due to a combined effort from its closed-back design and thick ear pads that yield better-than-average sound isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qNNz9Hrb4jtaK6kZ_hvUzPfizE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275062/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, you can connect via 3.5mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8zGl9"&gt;The particular model that Audeze sent along for review is made to be compatible with PS4 and PS5 consoles and with PCs via its 2.4GHz wireless receiver. (It also works with the Nintendo Switch, even though that isn’t advertised.) It’s clad in black with blue trim to signify which family of consoles it was designed for. The company also makes an Xbox version called the Penrose X that has green trim, and that model’s unique receiver has a two-position toggle switch that lets it work with Microsoft’s proprietary wireless tech in one mode, then on PC in the other. Otherwise, it’s the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgctql"&gt;There’s a caveat to all of this goodness: I didn’t find the Penrose to be comfortable to wear for even short gaming sessions. I never forgot that it was on my head because I felt squeezed the whole time, and that’s a deal-breaker for me. I should note that I have a somewhat large head, so it’s likely that people with smaller noggins won’t feel as compressed. But I imagine that its 320g weight would feel heavy on just about any noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxKz7E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10315655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzqb6"&gt;Other recent headsets I’ve liked, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, are 320g as well, but its weight is distributed much better. I barely notice that model on my head even after some time has passed, and that’s what I’m personally looking for in a headset. Granted, HyperX Cloud II doesn’t have hefty 100mm magnetic drivers like the Penrose does, which amounts to better sound at the expense of heavier ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7DXy4"&gt;I’d give Audeze more of a pass if the Penrose was an original design, but it’s almost identical to the $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17118960/audezes-mobius-headphones-gaming-3d-audio"&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/a&gt; released in 2018, which had enhanced 3D sound processing and head-tracking. (The Penrose lacks both features.) It also looks like the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171636/hyperx-cloud-orbit-gaming-headphones-planar-magnetic-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HyperX Cloud Orbit released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which features Audeze’s planar magnetic drivers, and much of the Mobius’ design. The Penrose’s build quality is still exceptional, but I wish the company had put more focus on refining the design, particularly as it relates to comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuHb_pwekMQ2d6QnzvrhmGq2I5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275059/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dials look easy to access, but they aren’t so simple to discern without looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrMLtb"&gt;As for the controls, the layout isn’t unintuitive, but some of the buttons don’t stand out enough when you’re feeling for them — specifically, the volume and mic level dials. Those are integrated into the backside of the left ear cup, and they’re raised, as opposed to being built flush into the ear cup, to make feeling for them easier (at least, that seems like the goal). Those raised hunks of plastic actually make the thin dials tough to discern and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A5xe0"&gt;Otherwise, it’s easy to take advantage of the Penrose’s main features, like being able to mute the mic with the switch on the left ear cup’s outer shell, or switching wireless modes with the multifunction button near where the detachable mic plugs in. The Penrose isn’t the only headset that lets you connect to a phone via Bluetooth while also being connected to your game console, but I think the execution here is great. If you get a call while you’re gaming, tapping the Penrose’s power button will pick up or hang up. (Careful, though: Audeze says your voice will be transmitted over both Bluetooth and wireless channels.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOpfF"&gt;Battery life is lackluster. I’ve gotten around 10 hours of use per charge, whereas some less expensive competing models in our headset buying guide offer 30 or more hours per charge. It’s not great considering the price, but it’s not a huge issue for me since I usually leave my headset at my PC or PS5 charging overnight anyway (made easier by the reversible USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6_9U36Qf_BPATpxodGu3W0L3GQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275063/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless receiver is shaped like a thumb drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IVNi7"&gt;It’s easy for me to recommend the Penrose based on its features and sound quality alone, but comfort plays an equally large role for me — and that’s where this headset is lacking the most. It’s a shame that the fit is so fatiguing because it’s really the only deal-breaker. Otherwise, the Penrose could be an ideal addition to any gamer’s life, especially those who want a headset that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Just heed the warning that, for certain head shapes and for people sensitive to wearing hefty headphones, it might not fit your head very well. &lt;/p&gt;

We regret this error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
