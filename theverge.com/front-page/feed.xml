    <title>California advances bill targeting Amazon labor algorithms</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbtOLW"&gt;California is close to enacting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/6/22659681/california-law-productivity-algorithms-warehouse-fulfillment-center-labor"&gt;a first-of-its-kind law&lt;/a&gt; that would block Amazon and other companies from punishing warehouse workers who fail to meet certain performance metrics for taking rest or meal breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iPnye"&gt;If enacted, the bill, &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"&gt;AB 701&lt;/a&gt;, would allow warehouse workers to challenge performance goals that many say discourage them from taking bathroom breaks or other rest breaks throughout the work day. The bill was written in response to high rates of reported injuries at Amazon warehouses where performance quotas are algorithmically enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogxo4F"&gt;The California Senate approved the measure on Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly where minor changes can be made before it finally lands on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Newsom has not signaled whether he would sign the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uZZrNl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KD88R7"&gt;AB 701 does not explicitly name Amazon in its text, but both Republican and Democratic lawmakers recognize that the e-commerce giant would be greatly affected by the enactment of the legislation. Over the last few years, Amazon has come under intense criticism for its performance quotas with several outlets reporting that workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;peed in bottles&lt;/a&gt; as a means of meeting their warehouse fulfillment goals and maintaining their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CetAi"&gt;The bill would also force companies like Amazon to make these performance algorithms more transparent, disclosing quotas to both workers and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR4iHS"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxRT26"&gt;Supporters of the legislation say that the bill would tamper down warehouse injuries, giving workers the opportunity to take breaks when over-stressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIBk89"&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections against unsafe algorithmic-enforced quota systems used by corporations like to push warehouse workers’ bodies to the breaking point,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LorenaAD80/status/1435746747226066946?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5EmZ"&gt;Business groups have come out &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/economy/amazon-labor-california-senate.html"&gt;in opposition of the bill&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it would harm the industry by empowering employees to file lawsuits that could be costly and time-consuming for companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOhBl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwmoCc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook debuts Ray-Ban Stories, smart glasses that record video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEKV0lkZFdSz5PUMpVLINy12I-k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835103/alopez_210907_4736_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with Facebook and Ray-Ban’s first pair of smart glasses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EGiRL1"&gt;Starting Thursday, the first pair of smart glasses made by Facebook and Ray-Ban are going on sale for $299. They’re called Ray-Ban Stories, and you’ll be able to find them pretty much anywhere Ray-Bans are sold, including LensCrafters and Sunglasses Hut stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFzGoM"&gt;The frames feature two-front facing cameras for capturing video and photos. They sync with a companion camera roll app called Facebook View, where clips can be edited and shared to other apps on your phone (not just Facebook’s own). There’s a physical button on the glasses for recording, or you can say “Hey Facebook, take a video” to control them hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1NJvz"&gt;And, perhaps most importantly, they look and feel like regular glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ASa5"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Glasses|103693" data-volume-uuid="78d3ba8ac" data-volume-id="103693" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-230" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj57zO"&gt;With their core ability of taking photos and videos, Ray-Ban Stories are essentially a sleeker version of Snapchat’s Spectacles, which first debuted in 2016 to a lot of hype that quickly fizzled. These Ray-Bans don’t have displays in the lenses, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;the latest Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; that were unveiled earlier this year. However, speakers on both sides of the frame can play sound from your phone over Bluetooth, allowing you to take a call or listen to a podcast without pulling your phone out. A touchpad built into the side of the frame lets you change the volume or play and pause what you’re hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnySmC"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories are the first product in a multiyear partnership between Facebook and the European eyewear conglomerate EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company. While they’re limited in what they can do, Ray-Ban Stories are the most normal-looking, accessible pair of smart glasses to hit the market so far. Both companies also see them as a step toward more advanced augmented reality glasses that overlay graphics onto the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeMN230e_m9-6A92GnU_KXzzqXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834548/alopez_210907_4736_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KUFcVb"&gt;After testing a pair of Ray-Ban Stories for the past week, I’m impressed with the build quality and how well they work. Initial pairing was easy, and syncing footage from the glasses back to the View app took only a few seconds through a Wi-Fi connection the glasses initiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBe3At"&gt;The dual 5-megapixel cameras can capture just over three dozen, 30-second video clips or roughly 500 photos before the on-device memory fills up. A physical button on the top of the right side of the frame lets you manually capture if you’d rather not use the “Hey Facebook” wake phrase. (Facebook says its voice assistant only listens for that phrase when turned on and that its functionality is limited to starting recordings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CSUab"&gt;A light on the inside of the glasses gives you a range of information: green for fully charged, orange for low battery, blue for pairing mode, red for dead battery or overheating, and white for a capture error. A separate, front-facing white light next to the right camera illuminates whenever the glasses are recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym00sPuEzaBp64U9vobYfRLkK6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834538/alopez_210907_4736_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPcXmj"&gt;Facebook says the glasses take about an hour to fully charge and that the battery will last for roughly six hours with intermittent use. The companion View app shows a live readout of the battery when the glasses are paired. My battery drained by about 20 percent during heavy use for an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JkUNC"&gt;The carrying case that comes with the glasses is sturdy, with a leather-like material and built-in charger that can refill the battery three times. The case itself charges via a USB-C cable that comes in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97j6jK"&gt;I expected the speakers on both sides of the frame to be soft and hollow, but they were surprisingly loud and full. I can see the audio playback over Bluetooth coming in handy for taking phone calls or maybe listening to podcasts, but I’d prefer to use proper headphones for listening to music. The audio doesn’t sound specifically targeted at the wearer’s ears, making it easy to overhear when you’re standing next to someone wearing the glasses. The touchpad on the side of the frame is a welcome inclusion for volume adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SXXAKx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Ray-Ban Glasses|103808" data-volume-uuid="434156c64" data-volume-id="103808" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-49" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video I shot of my dog Otis with Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPGqi1"&gt;The cameras in the glasses are nowhere as high quality as the cameras on modern smartphones. Instead, Ray-Ban Stories are meant to be used in moments when your hands are occupied, or you want to capture something fleeting. Despite a teaser video recently posted by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113884054500281"&gt;showing him out in the ocean with them on&lt;/a&gt;, the glasses aren’t designed to get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSfNpw"&gt;The companion View app is bare-bones, serving as a camera roll for the glasses with basic editing capabilities. You can favorite clips and do minor touch-ups before sending footage to any app of your choice. During initial setup, it walks you through the privacy policy that asks to let Facebook collect data about how you use the glasses. A Facebook account is required to use them, but the company isn’t analyzing what you record and save in the View app to personalize ads to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FL9A5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most compelling part of Ray-Ban Stories is the form factor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYiFHR"&gt;The most compelling part of Ray-Ban Stories is the form factor. I’ve tried a bunch of smart glasses over the years, and these are by far the most comfortable. They weigh just a few grams heavier than normal Wayfarers. You’ll also be able to get them with prescription lenses (although my ability to test the glasses was limited since the pair Facebook sent me to try didn’t have my prescription and I don’t wear contacts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jc4P8U"&gt;The tech in the glasses is so hidden that it’s hard to tell there are cameras on them at all. The white recording light is also fairly dim, which could pose privacy concerns if people don’t realize the glasses are capturing photos or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTFh0H"&gt;As far as smart glasses go, Ray-Ban Stories are relatively affordable. They start at $299, with polarized lenses bringing the price to $329 and transition lenses costing $379. The price for adding a prescription varies based on the type of insurance. There are three main frame styles: Wayfarer, Round, and Meteor. In total there are 20 combinations of styles, colors, sizes, and lens types. They are initially being sold online and in stores in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jhqkfmm_34qLQtVvlWMhmIqRdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834539/alopez_210907_4736_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Jz4Oz9"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban have a unique partnership that was formed at the highest levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEpice"&gt;The two companies first connected over two years ago when Luxottica’s chief wearable officer, Rocco Basilico, cold emailed Mark Zuckerberg asking to meet and discuss collaborating on smart glasses. Zuckerberg had publicly laid out Facebook’s aspiration to build AR glasses that could one day be as widely adopted as mobile phones. In a 2017 speech at Facebook’s developer conference, he showed the crowd a mockup of smart glasses that looked similar to Ray-Bans. Basilico was leading Luxottica’s own smart glasses efforts at the time and knew the eyewear giant needed to partner with a tech company to build them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gi73GY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not just a technological gadget, but something sexy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gGntT6"&gt;The deal was sealed when Zuckerberg flew to Milan in early 2019 to meet with Leonardo Del Vecchio, Luxottica’s founder and chairman. The two men agreed on the main proposition of the product. Facebook’s hardware executives traveled to tour Luxottica’s sprawling research center in northern Italy. Most of the features of the glasses (codenamed “Stella”) were decided during a weeklong workshop with top executives from both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAOuqA"&gt;These Ray-Bans are decidedly not a Facebook-branded product, like its Oculus VR headset or Portal video calling device lineup. Facebook is supplying the tech and software that powers the glasses, while Ray-Ban oversees the design and sale of them. Both companies declined to discuss the financial details of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wPFpW"&gt;The goal of Ray-Ban Stories is to “lay the groundwork in the minds of consumers for the many, many, future products that we have to come in this space,” Facebook’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, Andrew Bosworth, told me. It’s all part of Facebook’s goal to build what it thinks will be the next major computing platform after mobile phones. The company has over 10,000 people making consumer hardware, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;including a smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; it plans to help control its eventual AR glasses, which are internally codenamed “Orion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UdfnE"&gt;For Luxottica, the idea was to make smart glasses “not just a technological gadget, but something sexy,” according to Basilico. “We started with a sleek design and then we retrofitted the technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oLkssXEfcfGNLeNnt0WUWTo3Tyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834551/alopez_210907_4736_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewodU1"&gt;Luxottica deciding to partner with Facebook could also be an offensive move to get ahead of the coming smart glasses boom. Snap began giving its first iteration of Spectacles with AR displays to a handful of developers and partners earlier this year. Apple is working on its own AR glasses that are still several years out. In June of last year, Google bought the AR glasses startup North, signaling its interest in re-entering the consumer market after Google Glass failed nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEt1Th"&gt;If AR glasses do eventually become as ubiquitous as mobile phones, traditional eyewear companies like Luxottica won’t want to be caught flat-footed, according to Christopher Grayson, an AR and smart glasses analyst who has closely studied the luxury eyewear market. “You don’t want to be the taxicab industry when Uber shows up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRPjTz"&gt;In doing camera-equipped smart glasses, Facebook has also found one of the last things to copy from Snapchat. Both Bosworth and Basilico didn’t mention Spectacles by name in our conversations, but it was clear that they think Ray-Ban Stories are going to be more universally appealing than Spectacles. And they’re probably right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GGvKyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re going to have people use this device in unintended ways”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mVve5"&gt;“Things that appear to be like this have hit the market before, but nothing in terms of having super accessible design and all the features around the hands-free assistant and the audio,” said Bosworth. (Snap approached Luxottica to partner in the early days of Spectacles but the talks ultimately went nowhere, according to people involved in the discussions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvVBxI"&gt;Facebook sent me a list of advocacy groups that it consulted with on privacy-related issues during the development of the glasses, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the LGBT Technology Partnership. The people I spoke with said Facebook took their feedback seriously, and that they overall feel comfortable with how the product is designed. But some agreed that the recording light should be more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7eQUb"&gt;There will likely be resistance by some to wearing cameras and microphones made by Facebook, regardless how well the glasses are designed. But given how Facebook’s brand is nowhere to be found on the glasses themselves, I’m not sure that stigma will significantly hinder interest in Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UGmMz"&gt;The broader implications of smart glasses are still unknown. If they are eventually adopted by lots of people, they could have a chilling effect on the comfort others have in public spaces or become a tool for stalking, Jeremy Greenberg, counsel for the Future of Privacy Forum, told me. “You’re going to have people use this device in unintended ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qcNJyk"&gt;While it’s operating at a trust deficit, Facebook hopes that products like Ray-Ban Stories can avoid past mishaps and show that it’s keeping privacy in mind. “Getting products into market that start that dialogue with consumers around wearable glasses, it’s so important to us,” said Bosworth. “It’s important to do it in advance of the things to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s latest Mario collaboration is a big question mark block</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIq6eesHMRHS6vNrVu2RHAc8qH0=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834949/71395_LSM_2HY21_Cons_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUou5M"&gt;Lego’s latest Mario-themed set is a giant homage to &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, a giant question mark block that unfolds to reveal four levels from the Nintendo 64 game: Peach’s Castle, Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool Cool Mountain, and Lethal Lava Trouble. The “Lego Super Mario 64 ? Block set,” to use its official title, is made up of over two thousand pieces and will cost $169.99 when it goes on sale in Lego’s stores on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGY9Co"&gt;From the trailer released today, the set looks great: four blocky dioramas of a game that itself looks pretty blocky by modern standards. But I have to split hairs and point out that, as far as I’m aware, the question mark block never actually appears in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously, go back and look at screenshots if you don’t believe me! Those blocks have &lt;a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_64#:~:text=A%20floating,Power%20Stars."&gt;little exclamation marks on them&lt;/a&gt;, not question marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foKq5xD4_aWWLdjQGiT5MICA72A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837008/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_02__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block opens to reveal four levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1mNx5ZbsU07Hm5UYXhfpiIMkJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837009/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego’s previous Mario figures work with the new set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eDoLnN"&gt;Along with the levels, you also get a few figurines of characters from the original game, including Princess Peach, King Bob-omb, Chain Chomp, and of course, Mario himself. If you’ve been keeping up with Lego’s previous Mario sets, then you’ll be happy to hear that your existing Lego Mario and Luigi figurines will also work with the set and will apparently unlock unique music and sounds when placed in the levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83xqtt"&gt;The announcement of the new set suggests that Lego has no intention of bringing its collaborations with Nintendo to an end. The Danish toy company released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;first Mario set last year&lt;/a&gt; and added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi figurine into the mix in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571141/tanooki-mario-lego-set-power-up-pack-maker-expansion-piranha-chain-chomp"&gt;other expansion sets&lt;/a&gt;. It also produced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322481/lego-nintendo-nes-super-mario-interactive-set-replica"&gt;blocky replica of the original Nintendo Entertainment System console&lt;/a&gt; alongside a miniature retro TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEjUoH"&gt;Personally, though, I’m crossing my fingers that these sets are popular enough to get Lego to consider some sets based on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; major franchises like The Legend of Zelda or Metroid. Plumber’s are great and all, but I’d find it pretty hard to resist having a small Lego replica of Samus Aran’s spaceship on my shelf. Maybe one day? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s first Windows 11 commercial features Master Chief blowing stuff up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmFIHeuXC_bkW1YJb8ZD22weR-I=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834873/kjF2cQp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCPbBY"&gt;Microsoft is debuting its first ad campaign for Windows 11 today. The 60-second TV commercial is set to “All Starts Now” by Odessa and features the new Microsoft Store, Master Chief from the world of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, Microsoft Teams, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9hUkW"&gt;Explaining what a new version of Windows will bring to consumers is never easy, and Microsoft has opted for a similar approach to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;first Xbox Series X commercial&lt;/a&gt;. An actress walks through walls of apps and selects Xbox Game Pass, which triggers Master Chief to appear and blast a &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;banshee out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOBxT2nU8TR5BMGZw2g-jkBcl8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837038/kjF2cQp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief appears and blows up a Halo banshee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AiAuxM"&gt;The new bloom default wallpaper in Windows 11 also appears, alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;built-in Microsoft Teams experience&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s commercial focuses less on Windows 11 features, and more on making the OS appear... pretty. I think that’s largely the point, though. Microsoft has spent a lot of time on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;tweaking the design and visuals&lt;/a&gt; in Windows 11, with an aim of simplifying its operating system. The tagline of this commercial is “brings you closer to what you love,” presumably by removing some of the clutter that exists in Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HeGb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;launch Windows 11 on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, with new devices from partners and even its own Surface hardware. Microsoft will hold a separate Surface event on September 22nd, where we’re expecting to see a new Surface Go 3, Surface Pro 8, Surface Pro X, and a new Surface Book-like device all ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sega’s cashing in on old consoles by adding them to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Monkey Ball banana blitz" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5-3mPkrrmtP6MXygW81DXXSh5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834792/dreamcastball.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll through mazes as an inanimate Sega console because why not?&lt;/em&gt; | Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AnVDU"&gt;September 9th marks the anniversary of the US launch of Sega’s Dreamcast, its final console before the company pivoted completely to game development and publishing in the early aughts. Sega is honoring the Dreamcast, along with the Game Gear and Saturn, in the most illogical, but hilarious way by adding them as playable characters in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l7b9vR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"It's thinking..."   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dreamcast launched in the US on 9.9.99! Now, 22 years later, the Dreamcast, Saturn, and Game Gear are rolling into the world of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania!  ️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperMonkeyBall?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperMonkeyBall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BananaMania?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BananaMania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dreamcast?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEGASaturn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SEGASaturn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameGear?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GameGear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1CKNUHPdjk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1CKNUHPdjk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Super Monkey Ball (@SuperMonkeyBall) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMonkeyBall/status/1435951121135198210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0RXzGz"&gt;Sega has already announced some downloadable content for the game before its October 5th, 2021 launch date. At launch, you’ll be able to play as Kiryu from &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, as well as Beat from &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;, and others. These consoles-turned-characters will be available on the game’s launch day, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 to access them. After launch in November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641160/persona-5-morgana-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-dlc"&gt;Sega will launch Morgana from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; as a character&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also cost $4.99 to unlock. Sega also announced recently that Hello Kitty will be a playable character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pH5ex"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz&lt;/em&gt; is coming to consoles for $39.99. On Steam, it’ll cost $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft gives up predicting when its US offices will fully reopen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft To Layoff 18,000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7dtDBSccChTz3Z1TOLDCPXn4wp8=/75x0:5168x3395/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834671/452292668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stephen Brashear/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="940fVt"&gt;Microsoft is shelving its plans to fully reopen its US offices next month. The software giant had planned to reopen its headquarters on October 4th, but the ongoing uncertainty of COVID-19 and the spike in cases has forced the company to delay its back to the office push. Microsoft isn’t providing a new date to employees, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeW5jh"&gt;“Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, we’ve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our US work sites in favor of opening US work sites as soon as we’re able to do so safely based on public health guidance,” explains Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of modern work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTmosP"&gt;This latest delay follows a number of postponements this year to fully reopen Microsoft’s offices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;A limited reopening started in March&lt;/a&gt;, with original plans to open fully by July. This got pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364001/microsoft-offices-reopen-fully-september-7th-earliest-remote-work"&gt;back to September&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s now been delayed indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-JpBnGBrVL7a3kX-eZqNVbtM6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836446/Chart1_Desktop_840x572.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s latest data on hybrid work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tEHWjF"&gt;“The evolving Delta variant is compelling many of us to adjust plans for reopening worksites,” says Spataro. “It’s a stark reminder that this is the new normal. Our ability to come together will ebb and flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiVkgx"&gt;Microsoft’s delayed reopening comes as the company &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fworklab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shares more data on hybrid work&lt;/a&gt;, and its efforts to modernize Office and Microsoft Teams for this “new normal.” Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is calling this the “Great Reshuffle,” as businesses rethink cultures, company values, and how employees work daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUR8r"&gt;According to data from LinkedIn and Glint, 87 percent of people would prefer to stay remote at least half of the time, suggesting that employers will need to adapt to the idea of hybrid work quickly. The Great Reshuffle terminology also works well to describe Microsoft’s predictions in July that “41 percent of the global workforce is likely to consider leaving their current employer within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is getting more hybrid work improvements and Apple CarPlay support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7y_9eAfhshqtkAPmRhp2wS3gjBQ=/127x0:1468x894/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834656/Qd9KibJ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams with Apple CarPlay support.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RuWeCQ"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to improve the remote meeting experience in Microsoft Teams with better camera support and other improvements that will let you stay in meetings 24/7, if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wm34P"&gt;After rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode last year&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;vision for the future of meetings&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Microsoft Teams will soon be updated to support intelligent cameras. These cameras will be supplied by partners like Jabra, Neat, Poly, and Yealink and will enable AI-powered active speaker tracking, multiple video streams, and people recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxrLwu"&gt;They’re the type of cameras that can actually deliver on some of Microsoft’s promises for the future of meetings, enabling cameras in meeting rooms to use audio, facial movements, and gestures to detect who’s in a room and speaking. These cameras are designed to improve and bridge the gap between remote and office meetings, as more and more businesses look to strike a balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9I8wnOirDMJGQaHmZFQM0VZdk6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836460/Companionmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated companion mode for Teams mobile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="taBG5b"&gt;Microsoft Teams on mobile is also being updated to include quick access to chat, live reactions, and the Microsoft Whiteboard. This updated companion mode will also include easier access to controls like mute or camera on / off and will be available “in the next few months,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Fu13"&gt;Speaker coach, an AI-powered Teams feature that monitors your pace during meetings, is arriving in early 2022, and automatic lighting corrections for Teams video meetings will appear in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydpi8TJL1ztLVbdxdbX3TVfS9w0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836461/cameopowerpoint.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Cameo feature in PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UH3Ynd"&gt;Microsoft is also bringing Microsoft Teams to Apple CarPlay this month, so you can be part of Teams calls while driving. You’ll be able to join calls on the road hands-free using Siri, but it appears you’ll only join in audio mode to prevent video from creating a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xG32uu"&gt;It’s not just Teams that’s getting meeting improvements, though. Microsoft is also bringing a new Cameo feature to PowerPoint that lets you integrate a Teams camera into your presentation slide deck. Cameo will start appearing in early 2022 and is designed with remote presentations in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Y: The Last Man’s showrunner on adapting the comic: ‘It’s not a blueprint for television’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZOHer2RyHdWHu3iQGm-6JpSRP0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834581/YTLM_101__8937R_copy.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rafy Winterfeld / FX Networks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aFuTm"&gt;A decade ago, when Eliza Clark read &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, she kept thinking about how she would adapt it for television. “It combined so many things that I loved,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The story takes place after a mysterious event that kills off everyone with a Y chromosome, with the exception of a man named Yorrick (and his monkey). She describes it as “such an interesting look at identity.” At the time, she was working as a writer’s assistant, so it was mostly a dream. But 10 years later — after a few stops working on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Killing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rubicon&lt;/em&gt; — Clark got the chance to lead FX’s live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt;. It was an opportunity not only to adapt a series she loved, but to update it for modern audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHG65k"&gt;“I definitely didn’t want to make something that had an essentialist view of gender,” she says. “And I think the show makes clear, early and often, that Yorrick is not the last man. That was something that I felt needed to be updated from the source material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4oDgm"&gt;The show, which debuts next week on FX on Hulu, follows the same basic premise as the book, with much of it set after a cataclysmic event that results in every cisgender male on the planet dying. The exception is Yorrick (Ben Schnetzer), a slacker, wannabe escape artist, and son of a high-ranking US politician. The series — at least for the first six episodes I’ve been able to watch — follows a fairly large cast making their way through this newly desolate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MO9TO4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The show is not about how men and women are different.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okSjIr"&gt;Alongside Yorrick, there’s Agent 355 (Ashley Romans), a secret agent tasked with protecting him; the newly implemented president, Jennifer Brown (Diane Lane); Sam Jordan (Elliot Fletcher), a friend who helps Yorrick’s sister Hero (Olivia Thirlby) survive a difficult journey; and Kimberly Campbell Cunningham (Amber Tamblyn) a best-selling conservative author who also happens to be the daughter of the now-deceased president; among others. In addition to a cast that’s full of women, the TV version also puts a bigger focus on trans men, including a brand-new character, played by Fletcher, who has a significant role in the first season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CjpLScqqI0L2FNXEflSMbRwmxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835536/ytlm_101_0587.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Rafy Winterfeld / FX Networks&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PI2sDr"&gt;“I wanted to make it clear that he was not the only male,” Clark says of Yorrick’s place in the story. “I really think the show is an ensemble. I never wanted to make something that boils people down in such a specific way. The show is not about how men and women are different. It’s about people and nature and the diversity of gender. He’s important, but he’s not the main character. He’s the story engine.” She adds that one of her goals was to show that “the world is far more vast and varied and beautiful than the binary definition of man and woman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDmMtB"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://buttondown.email/charliejane/archive/everything-i-learned-from-working-on-season-one/"&gt;a blog post about working on the series&lt;/a&gt;, writer Charlie Jane Anders explained, “When you update a beloved-but-problematic story, you shouldn’t have to choose between fixing the problems and preserving the stuff you love. You can trust that expanding the picture to include everyone who has been left out will only make the story better, and that questioning the assumptions at the root of the story will lead to a smarter version. &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; is a thought experiment that asks big questions about gender and human nature — and including more variables only makes an experiment more robust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zc23UG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He’s important, but he’s not the main character. He’s the story engine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck9UUG"&gt;Clark says she was largely given free rein over the project, and that included the blessing of original writer, Brian K. Vaughan. “Brian knew I was a fan of the book, so hopefully he felt safe in that,” she explains. “He read scripts when I asked him to, and we talked about things like casting. But he very much was like, ‘I made this when I was 25 years old, and I can’t even remember who I was then. So take this and run with it,’ which I appreciated.” When it comes to changing the material, she notes that “the comic book is a medium unto itself. It’s not a blueprint for television.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w2SLFt"&gt;Figuring out tone has been a persistent challenge for post-apocalyptic stories amid the current pandemic, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518583/netflix-sweet-tooth-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t an exception. The first episode is very grim — it covers the event itself, which means lots of deaths — but from there, things lighten up (at least somewhat) with a mix of humor, action, and characters who are genuinely trying to do good. “I think the thing that sets this show apart is it does have an optimistic view of the power of people to change, and the power of relationships,” Clark says of her approach. “At the beginning, it’s dark because a dark thing happens and half the world dies, and I didn’t want to make light of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQBFSm"&gt;One of the more lighthearted elements of the show is Yorrick’s pet monkey Ampersand. In the show, Amp is actually a CG creation created by famed effects studio ILM, a fact Clark says she was “terrified” about. “The visual style of the show is so gritty and realistic,” she says. “You’re getting really close to people’s faces, you’re seeing skin, you’re seeing sweat. You’re close to people, and then you pan over, and there’s a cartoon monkey — I did not want that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjDMIC"&gt;For the most part, it worked. Before talking to Clark, I wasn’t actually sure if Amp was entirely a CG creation or if there was also a real animal on set. And that’s exactly how she likes it. “I want people to know how hard ILM worked on it,” she says with a laugh, “but I also don’t want people to know that he’s CG.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8Jy1w"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Y: The Last Man &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres September 13th on FX on Hulu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the PlayStation Showcase 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZWbCM"&gt;While Microsoft has hosted plenty game showcases in 2021, Sony has been comparatively quiet about what’s coming to the PS5 in 2022. Well, Sony is going to break its relative silence with a 40-minute event that will offer “a look into the future of PS5.” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says to expect updates from its various PlayStation Studios (the number of which seem to grow every month) on games launching this holiday and others that will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGpsMT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon: Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; may get some air time, since it’s a PlayStation-exclusive title that’ll be launching in the next handful of months. Of course, there’s more excitement about games we know less about. We’ve yet to see a trailer for the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; title, so perhaps it’ll make its gameplay debut. There are a host of other possibilities, like info on &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7 &lt;/em&gt;or news on the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlQbkE"&gt;Perhaps Sony is ready to widely roll out the new PS5 firmware that will enable the M.2 SSD slot in all consoles. Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing DLC news for exclusives that released in 2021, like &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1Km22"&gt;As for what we won’t see, Sony says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"&gt;the new PSVR hardware made for PS5&lt;/a&gt; won’t be in the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UtvihO"&gt;When does the PlayStation game showcase start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pLK7Ie"&gt;The stream will kick off at 4PM ET / 1PM PT / 9PM BST on Thursday, September 9th. As previously mentioned, it’ll last for 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MkImSG"&gt;Where can I watch the PlayStation game showcase?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AjnqPS"&gt;This event will be streamed on YouTube (embedded above) and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, the Twitch stream can be a few seconds ahead, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A bunch of ape NFTs just sold for $24.4 million</title>

  &lt;p id="U49uqm"&gt;If you thought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT mania&lt;/a&gt; was about to die off, think again: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-yacht-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 NFTs from Bored Ape Yacht Club just sold at Sotheby’s for $24.4 million. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-kennel-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs sold for $1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAsJw1"&gt;That puts the ape sale among the biggest in the NFT space. A bundle of nine CryptoPunks — one of the earliest NFT projects — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs"&gt;sold for $16.9 million&lt;/a&gt; in May. And Beeple sold a collage of his works as an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March. While it’s hard to directly compare all of these sales (there are 101 items in today’s auctions versus one in Beeple’s), the purchases show that the appetite for NFT art isn’t dying down, and they suggest that buyers think there’ll be high resale value as the market continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9m2q5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Who’ll make the next million-dollar NFT?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lAyRlm"&gt;The two sales at Sotheby’s today come from Yuga Labs, the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC, which launched in April. The initial collection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;contained 10,000 apes, semi-randomly generated&lt;/a&gt; in unique arrangements of sailor hats, eye patches, bone necklaces, stud earrings, and other accessories to dress them up. Ape owners get to be members of the titular club, which is supposed to provide various benefits (so far, that’s mostly been access to exclusive merch drops, bonus NFTs, and use of an online graffiti board). Bored Ape Kennel Club is a series of accompanying dog NFTs that were later sent out to ape owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiApvG"&gt;Generative NFT collections like this have taken off in recent months, with all kinds of copycats and twists launching to take advantage of the hype. After its debut, BAYC quickly become the second-biggest name in NFT collections, right behind CryptoPunks. The cheapest ape now sells for around $149,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2l51Xt"&gt;Meanwhile, centuries-old auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s have seen the (literal) value in promoting this new format for art and have hosted a number of sales for high-profile NFTs. An auction at Christie’s will feature BAYC &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/en/auction/no-time-like-present-20909-hgk/"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
