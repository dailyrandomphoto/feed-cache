    <title>Lordstown Motors stops work on electric van to focus on pickup truck</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1cwuv"&gt;Lordstown Motors has stopped working on an electric van and other future projects in order to aim all resources at putting its first vehicle, a pickup truck called Endurance, into production later this year. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/03/17/2194909/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html"&gt;previously announced in March&lt;/a&gt; that it was accelerating work on the van, but it has struggled since then, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; resigning this week after an investigation into misleading claims about preorders for the Endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJS0Gi"&gt;Burns previously billed the van as a “high-top” recreational vehicle with up to 350 miles of range. He said that it would be the “first mass produced all-electric RV,” and that Lordstown Motors believed “there will be many commercial use cases for an electric van of this size and capability.” But that will have to wait while the startup focuses on surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LAlyuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was supposed to be the “first mass produced all-electric RV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUsHtN"&gt;“We do have a prototype van that’s been completed, and it shares a lot of commonized parts with the Endurance. It will possibly be shown later in the summer, but at this point, we’re currently focused only on the Endurance,” Lordstown Motors president Rich Schmidt said during an Automotive Press Association event on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoLuaN"&gt;Schmidt also said that a collaboration with RV company Camping World is on hold, which is supposed to involve service centers that would support the van. “Again we’re just focused currently on the Endurance truck. That’s our next goal for the next three months, is to make sure we hit our production targets and stay within our budgets and drive forward to getting the vehicles ready for the market,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKp00J"&gt;Lordstown Motors interim CEO Angela Strand confirmed during the event that the startup still plans to start limited production of the Endurance in late September of this year. But Schmidt confirmed Tuesday that Lordstown Motors only has enough funding to make trucks through May 2022. That’s despite the fact that Lordstown Motors raised $675 million late last year after it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and became a publicly traded company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pAfXML"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The van was supposed to be revealed this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZu2LG"&gt;Lordstown Motors said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021003449/ride-20201231x10k.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_"&gt;March in its annual report&lt;/a&gt; filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it planned to reveal the electric van in June and start production in late 2022. But Schmidt said Tuesday that it will now “possibly be shown later in the summer.” The startup also recently filed &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000155837021008107/ride-20201231x10ka.htm#Item7ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisof_"&gt;an amended version of its annual report&lt;/a&gt;, and the section about the van was removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtLcwZ"&gt;Representatives for Lordstown Motors and Camping World did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0iw15"&gt;Burns founded Lordstown Motors in 2019 after he left another EV startup called Workhorse. Lordstown Motors quickly snapped up a shuttered plant (and equipment) from General Motors, a deal that was praised by then-President Donald Trump, and licensed an in-development electric pickup truck from Workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQe3Yn"&gt;Having a factory and a vehicle that was already largely designed was a huge part of the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000121390020019762/ea124863ex99-2_diamondpeak.htm"&gt;pitch&lt;/a&gt; Lordstown Motors made in 2020 to potential SPAC partners. Lordstown Motors said in its investor presentation that it had a “clear path to be first to market” in offering an all-electric commercial pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gA0fmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"},{"title":"Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RCqBjZ"&gt;But the startup has struggled lately. Short-selling firm Hindenburg Research published a report in March full of allegations that Lordstown Motors had misled investors about how many preorders it had collected for the Endurance, and claimed that the startup was behind on its target production date. The SEC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;subsequently opened an official probe&lt;/a&gt; into the claims, and Lordstown Motors assembled its own committee to investigate the allegations in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mOS45"&gt;Lordstown Motors said shortly after the report was published that it would share “a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.” Burns told a &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/theres-always-haters-lordstown-motors-ceo-responds-to-negative-report/"&gt;local news outlet&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “always haters,” and that he “quoted Taylor Swift to somebody the other day: ‘Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.’ You gotta shake it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAGk4N"&gt;Lordstown Motors remained mostly silent on the report until this week, when the company’s committee and the board of directors released their findings. While they disputed Hindenburg’s claims about problems with the Endurance’s development, they confirmed that Lordstown Motors executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;had misled investors about the viability of the preorders it had collected&lt;/a&gt;. Burns and Rodriguez announced their resignations the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9PliY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a new day at Lordstown”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n86san"&gt;In the interim, Lordstown Motors lowered its goal for how many trucks it plans to make in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;announced that it needed to raise more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ph60PS"&gt;Schmidt said Tuesday that he believes Lordstown Motors now has enough committed customers for the reduced number of trucks the startup can build by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksBMfk"&gt;“It’s a new day at Lordstown, and there are no disruptions and will be no disruptions to our day to day operations,” Strand said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s COVID-19 test is now available to consumers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmQ6oaDvBDaPKyZGqgafUCHjit0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456816/amazon_covid_19_test_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPmBxE"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZR5XNBM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling its own&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 test kit directly to customers. Results from the test will appear on an &lt;a href="https://amazondx.com/"&gt;Amazon diagnostics website&lt;/a&gt; that was originally designed for use by Amazon employees. The test’s public availability was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/15/amazon-covid-test-consumers-diagnostics-portal/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQRTgB"&gt;The test is on sale for $39.99 and has one-day shipping through Prime in some areas of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz3jdB"&gt;To use the test, a patient swabs their own nose at home and places it in a box with a prepaid shipping return label. The swabs are then sent to a centralized lab. Amazon got the Food and Drug Administration’s sign-off on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353058/amazon-fda-authorization-covid-test-home"&gt;its COVID-19 test kit&lt;/a&gt; in March. At the time, it planned to use the test for its onsite employee testing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krCFSr"&gt;At-home medical testing got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;new burst of attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, as companies raced to deliver COVID-19 tests that people could take easily without a trip to the doctor’s office. Experts think it’ll supercharge efforts to bring other types of at-home tests, like flu tests, to the market more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBjYbZ"&gt;Amazon also offers a COVID-19 testing kit made by the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DxTerity-COVID-19-Collection-Shipping-Laboratory/dp/B08Q1TMY7X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=30VY1AKJTC7CA&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=dxterity+covid-19+saliva+at-home+collection+kit&amp;amp;qid=1623782784&amp;amp;sprefix=dxterity%2Caps%2C160&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;genomics company DxTerity&lt;/a&gt; and a rapid 10-minute testing kit made by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quidel-QuickVue-at-Home-COVID-19-Test/dp/B093ND7LX4/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=30VY1AKJTC7CA&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=dxterity+covid-19+saliva+at-home+collection+kit&amp;amp;qid=1623782784&amp;amp;sprefix=dxterity%2Caps%2C160&amp;amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExUUI4S1pQVk5BU0FDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODE2NzQ1TTY5RVk3QkZOVE4wJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNzcyNDNXV1ZFSVZDODE4Nk8md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Quidel&lt;/a&gt;. They sell for $99 and $24.95, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7HqRb"&gt;The in-house COVID-19 test kit is the latest in Amazon’s expansion into healthcare. The company started offering its telehealth and at-home healthcare program to other employers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336010/amazon-care-expand-employees-virtual"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also offering &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-pharmacy-to-offer-six-month-prescriptions-starting-at-6"&gt;six-month prescriptions&lt;/a&gt; for common medications starting at $6 through its Amazon Pharmacy program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G528YV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OSzDJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Prime Day deals</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqjWjM"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the retail giant’s two-day blitz of deals and promotions, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;lands on June 21st&lt;/a&gt;. The annual shopping event is taking a place a few weeks earlier than it has in the past, yet despite still being a week away, Amazon has already kick-started the event with a slew of deals for Amazon Prime subscribers, discounting everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to the latest pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are likely to go live in the days leading up to the main event, too, with retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy joining the shopping fray with deals of their own, many of which will rival Amazon’s offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQOiJ"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals. In most instances, all you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the deals, however, a few promotions come with some additional caveats that we’ll note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PzRclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":" The Verge’s Father’s Day Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Omrvrp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds (second-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D7ZuXF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; were appealing when they launched two months ago — and that was before they received a $40 discount. They also improve upon their predecessors in almost every way, offering up enjoyable sound, better comfort, and effective noise cancellation that helps you to drown out the world around you. They can’t compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds, or a way to bring Alexa with you on the go, the Echo Buds are it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPdJR0"&gt;Right now, you can snag the standard, second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTY1HQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white for $80. Amazon is also offering $40 off the version with the wireless charging case, bringing the price down to $100 for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFw2gO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LChb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gXr8Hu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt; is no Fitbit, but if you don’t mind a little invasiveness and can get around the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated screen, it’s a convenient way to track your sleep habits, chart your physical activity, and access a host of workout programs. While the woven, band-like device can track basic fitness metrics like your steps and heart rate, it can also measure your body fat percentage and the tone of your voice, a tool which will supposedly measure your emotional state throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTy0WF"&gt;The Amazon Halo is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QKPCQKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in several sizes and color configurations for $70, the lowest price we’ve seen the band since its debut in August 2020. The fitness tracker also comes with a six-month membership, after which you’ll be required to pay $3.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vU2DAg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="AnofkV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sign up for Amazon Prime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="lpBzPI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 (first-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V6vA7l"&gt;The recently updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best smart displays you can get for the bedroom, however, it’s also not nearly as affordable as its last-gen counterpart. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; offers much of the same functionality in the same compact package. Like the newer model, it features a vibrant touchscreen and a host of voice-activated features, and while its 1-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired, it does come with a physical shutter if you’re someone who prefers privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiR31X"&gt;Normally $80, the Echo Show is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;priced at $45&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet on Amazon’s capable smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFqJae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHMESO"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (fourth-gen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7fd6rg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s latest entry-level smart speaker, is yet another refinement of what has become the most popular model in the Echo lineup. Despite its price and size, the Alex-equipped speaker still manages to tout impressive sound and a commendable set of mics, which allow you to play music, control your smart home gadgets, and carry out the full range of commands you might find on other, more capable Echo devices. It’s the entry-level smart speaker to get, even if the new design isn’t as convenient for mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrCp0b"&gt;Now through Prime Day, the fourth-gen Echo Dot is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-Blue/dp/B084J4MZK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get one free&lt;/a&gt; with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PDDOT2PK &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiqUna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BMm3YQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JpmtUX"&gt;If you haven’t tried Amazon Music Unlimited before, Amazon is offering Prime members a four-month free trial to the popular Spotify and Apple Music alternative. Its feature set is akin to most of its competitors, however, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;offers lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost, a perk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple recently rolled&lt;/a&gt; out to Apple Music subscribers. With Amazon Music Unlimited, you’ll gain access to ad-free listening, podcasts, and a robust catalog of more than 70 million songs, not to mention the service’s deep integration with Amazon devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEAkAT"&gt;Just be sure to cancel your subscription before the trial ends if you no longer want to continue subscribing after the four-month window. Otherwise, you’ll automatically be charged an $8 monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="LMENHd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2NBjU1"&gt;The Amazon Echo remains the namesake of the current Echo lineup. Although it shares much of its functionality with the aforementioned Echo Dot, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Echo&lt;/a&gt; produces bigger, bolder sound and features a built-in smart home hub, meaning you can connect it with lightbulbs, door sensors, and a host of other popular Zigbee devices sans a secondary hub. It even has a temperature sensor, just in case you want to turn on your air conditioner or fan via Alexa routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4YrIb"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting a pair&lt;/a&gt; of Echos ahead of Prime Day, knocking $30 off the price of two with offer code &lt;strong&gt;ECHOPRIME &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="407A0B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqGaWV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9qTMwM"&gt;With Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532868/amazon-game-streaming-luna-access-no-invite-prime-day-members"&gt;opening up Luna access&lt;/a&gt; to all Prime subscribers on June 21st and 22nd, now might be your best opportunity to check out Amazon’s answer to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud. Using a dedicated app or browser, the cloud gaming platform is available on pretty much any device you can throw at it — including Windows, Mac, FireTV, iOS, iPadOS, and select Android devices — and offers a way to stream titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus &lt;/em&gt;without a dedicated console or gaming machine. Basic subscriptions run $5.99 a month, though, you can also pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel, which grants you access to a range of Ubisoft titles, including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0KHof"&gt;We found the service to be hit or miss in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;initial review&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller for $49&lt;/a&gt; as part of its early Prime Day deals, making the lack of titles far more palatable. You can also purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle with a Fire TV Stick for $74&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KT9XY9Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;phone clip for $82&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to attach your phone directly to the Luna Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vEOXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606997"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOhmCy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BZzTsE"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television certainly doesn’t offer the kind of picture afforded by today’s best OLEDs, but it’s hard to find a Fire TV Edition model that supports HDR10, a feature that allows for better brightness, color accuracy, and contrast. Insignia’s 4K TV also supports HDMI ARC and HDMI eARC, meaning you can utilize a single cable to send audio from a compatible soundbar or receiver to your TV, and features Amazon’s Fire TV software, allowing you to access Prime Video, Netflix, and a slew of popular streaming services without a standalone streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZi8EO"&gt;As of this week, Insignia’s 4K Fire TV Edition model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen yet on the 55-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pj5QuH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gLz8Bs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audible Premium Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuUbyq"&gt;If you’re an audiobook fan, it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s audiobook service, Audible. Its catalog spans more than 200,000 ad-free titles, and it's peppered with exclusives and originals, some of which come in the form of podcasts and guided wellness programs. A monthly subscription to Audible Premium Plus provides you with one credit a month, which can be redeemed for any premium audiobook in Amazon’s catalog, regardless of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG7MNG"&gt;Audible Premium Plus subscriptions typically run $15 a month, however, now through Prime Day, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe for $7 a month&lt;/a&gt; for the first four months, after which the subscription rate will automatically revert to the standard rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue1uCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best trailers of E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krK13fyoeHWxPx7TuSvxSpRQVfA=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456563/MGG_2021_06_14_scr_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Guardians, vampires, rabbids, and lots of chaos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LBWZjL"&gt;The 2021 edition of E3 was perhaps the weirdest yet. After taking a year off due to the pandemic, the world’s biggest gaming event returned in a digital-only format. A lot of big names were still present — like Microsoft, Nintendo, and Square Enix — and there were plenty of surprising reveals and other announcements. But the spectacle felt somewhat diminished without the in-person experience. Meanwhile, the show seemed to come together at the very last moment — seriously, we didn’t even know the schedule of events until just a few days before E3 kicked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8JBS8"&gt;So you’d be forgiven for having missed some of the show. Lucky for you, we’ve gathered together the best trailers from E3 in one place, so you can catch up on the most exciting announcements, gameplay reveals, and more. Check them out below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktXQgV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iqKCh1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-jFYYMkJh4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ax2Bh"&gt;After the muted reception to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;Square Enix’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, it’s surprising just how exciting &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; looks. Based on the initial footage, the game appears to really nail the Guardians vibe, complete with lots of banter and ’80s music. It’s being developed by &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; studio Eidos Montreal and, perhaps best of all, is a completely single-player game with no microtransactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gvJ7aM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ub5pGX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYqyVpCV-3c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lMP8lP"&gt;Bethesda’s next epic, &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, was announced in 2018 with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;the teasiest of teasers&lt;/a&gt;. We knew its name and that it was about space, but that’s about it. The latest trailer doesn’t show a whole lot more of the game, but at least it feels a lot more real now. It even has a release date: November 11th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C9Q1mX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="iAqYyP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Axmg1E4HrVE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3&amp;amp;start=3" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SP1Dbf"&gt;Who knows if James Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;sequels will ever actually materialize, but at least you’ll be able to head back to Pandora in a video game. Ubisoft studio Massive Entertainment, best known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;Division&lt;/em&gt; games, is helming this new title, which puts players in the role of a Na’vi exploring a new part of the alien planet. It’s due to launch next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Hkb77H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532181/redfall-arkane-studios-co-op-vampire-shooter-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="DAmA6m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxX-4U5uJqk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S06BDE"&gt;Take the co-op premise of &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt;, add in some terrifying vampires, and put it in the hands of the immersive sim wizards at Arkane, and you end up with &lt;em&gt;Redfall,&lt;/em&gt; a Microsoft exclusive for PC and Xbox launching next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kCfUfZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532168/forza-horizon-5-trailer-xbox-pc-e3-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="WnYn6S"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=12&amp;amp;start=12" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BKBftj"&gt;There are few better ways to show off new hardware than with shiny cars. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; is yet further proof of this, with a gorgeous trailer that shows off how good a next-gen racer can look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IuQWrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532165/microsoft-xbox-the-outer-worlds-2-e3-2021-showcase-obsidian-avowed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="OcRrQv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClhDyC0ZECs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UrgHHn"&gt;If all you’re going to announce is the name of a new game, you may as well have some fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2DLoRF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="47CKLh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4DIqCzQOGs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6QiPSz"&gt;Sometimes you just need to get straight to the action. The E3 trailer for &lt;em&gt;They Always Run&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t waste much time with setup, instead jumping right into gameplay that shows off the fast and furious combat. The game is listed as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eruWq0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somerville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="w3vy4O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcjnHHxHV3o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saNFxi"&gt;Given that &lt;em&gt;Somerville&lt;/em&gt;’s developers have previously worked on games like &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Limbo&lt;/em&gt;, it’s no surprise that the game looks dark and evocative. Only this time, it looks like the game — which takes place in the midst of some kind of large-scale catastrophe — has more three-dimensional elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3xNmch"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530737/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-nintendo-leak-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="EwovrY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMNBC8lRtvY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7enxWe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16214482/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a combination that came out of nowhere: Nintendo’s iconic characters, joining forces with Ubisoft’s Minion-like rabbids, in a game that channels the turn-based action of XCOM. Now, a sequel is on the way, and it somehow looks even more charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="W0aCEH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531085/far-cry-6-trailer-giancarlo-esposito-villain-e3-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="cCM5Vk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNKNr4qIaRc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj5uam"&gt;Four minutes of Giancarlo Esposito chewing scenery is exactly what we all need right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cjkBl4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="fKzznv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOeB_LXeV4c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9Bdk4"&gt;We’ve already seen a bit of the next &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; story, but the E3 trailer gives a great look at how the powers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393602/life-is-strange-true-colors-alex-chen-interview"&gt;which are based on the concept of empathy&lt;/a&gt;, actually work. &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is launching this September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WaMPX1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are OFK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="frTb4L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/77z6J6Jq-io?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QTkMGC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are OFK&lt;/em&gt; is described as an “interactive series” that follows the early career of a fictional pop group. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166143/we-are-ofk-interactive-series-virtual-pop-group-the-game-awards"&gt;We already knew the game was stylish&lt;/a&gt;, but the latest trailer also gives some hints as to how it will play, including what looks like an interesting decision-based story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GGXT3A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Stop&lt;/em&gt; is the next release from &lt;em&gt;Variable State&lt;/em&gt;, the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;the mind-bending and cinematic &lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new game follows a trio of characters as they experience a strange, supernatural event from different perspectives. It’s coming out on July 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O2eohA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OlliOlli World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="zrYTdA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; continues to be one of the most gorgeous games in development, blending Moebius-inspired visuals with a vast world to explore. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;We’ve been following it for some time&lt;/a&gt;, and now it finally has a release date: September 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LOTFZt"&gt;One of the most anticipated games of E3 made a late appearance, with a gorgeous new trailer showcasing a new &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; world in the skies. The sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s expected to hit the Nintendo Switch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HS43W3"&gt;The long-rumored&lt;em&gt; Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; is not only real — it’s coming very soon. Nintendo officially unveiled the game at E3, which is a direct sequel to &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt; and the first brand-new 2D &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game in nearly two decades. It’s launching on the Switch on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next step for wearables could be illness ‘warning lights’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch OS 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXh2zueaFAkTFGlY605oKWtNPXQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456509/20150914-apple-watch-os-2-os2-14.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7JE9o"&gt;Harpreet Rai, the CEO of smart ring company Oura, often &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/23/oura-ceo-harpreet-rai-our-smart-ring-users-found-coronavirus-detection.html"&gt;tells a story&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ouraring/status/1239580766427697152"&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; Facebook post. An Oura ring user posted that the device said that his overall health score had dropped below his normal level, which prompted him to get tested for COVID-19 — and the test ended up being positive. The company heard from other users, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCzNCm"&gt;The anecdotal reports encouraged Oura to partner with research teams to try to figure out how well the ring could predict who might be sick with COVID-19. Their studies were part of a wave of interest over the past year in wearable devices as illness detectors. Now, flush with data, researchers and wearable companies are looking toward their next steps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sFXzq"&gt;Research done over the past year showed that it’s probably possible to flag when someone is sick. But differentiating &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; illness someone might have will be much harder. Experts think it might eventually be possible, but in the near future, illness detection programs might look more like warning lights: they could tell a user that they might be getting sick, but just not with what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="txKcx2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just like the warning light for your car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlaXXp"&gt;“It’s just like the warning light for your car — take it into the mechanic, we don’t know what’s wrong, but something looks off,” Rai says. “I think that’s where the industry is heading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Q1YshH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illness signatures &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1jP44H"&gt;Even before the pandemic, researchers were checking wearables’ data to see if they could find telltale signatures that might predict illnesses. One study published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500%2819%2930222-5/fulltext#seccestitle150"&gt;early 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that data from Fitbits could predict state-level trends in flu-like illnesses, for example. Other research found that wearable devices could detect signs of &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;. A research team at Mount Sinai Health System in New York used wearables to predict disease flare-ups in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ePtij"&gt;When COVID-19 hit, many of those research teams adjusted their focus. “We decided to shift some of our emphasis to how we can evaluate and identify COVID-19 infections, using the same techniques and technology,” says Robert Hirten, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai who worked on wearables and IBD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlzuYo"&gt;Hirten’s research showed that Apple Watches could detect changes in the heart rate variability of healthcare workers &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2021/mount-sinai-study-finds-wearable-devices-can-detect-covid19-symptoms-and-predict-diagnosis-pr"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; before they were diagnosed with COVID-19. Heart rate variability, which tracks the time between heartbeats, is a good proxy for how the nervous system is working, he says. “Often it seems to be very telling of something going on in the body, even before people realize something is happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAlru"&gt;Other types of data were also useful. A Stanford University study found that heart rate, daily steps, and time asleep as measured by smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00640-6"&gt;changed in a small group of users&lt;/a&gt; before they developed symptoms of COVID-19. The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78355-6#Sec11"&gt;first report&lt;/a&gt; from the TemPredict study at the University of California, San Francisco found that the Oura ring could detect increases in body temperature before wearers developed COVID-19 symptoms. Through a partnership with New York-based Northwell Health, Fitbit &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00363-7#Sec6"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that its devices tracked changes in heart rate and breathing rate in the days before someone started feeling sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1hH7b"&gt;The research is ongoing. Groups at UCSF and the West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute continue to run studies with Oura ring, and Fitbit is still working on research with Northwell Health. Fitbit is also part of &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/covid-19-study/"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; out of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and the Stanford Medicine Healthcare Innovation Lab. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/can-digital-devices-help-detect-flu-covid-19-infection"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on respiratory disease prediction and Apple Watch in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kJ1N3S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are really learning better ways to identify and predict conditions.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70OXCR"&gt;The big wearable companies have a good reason to pursue this line of research; the studies done so far are promising. “People are really learning better ways to identify and predict conditions,” Hirten says. “This has really taken the field of wearable technologies forward significantly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NmDC7E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A warning light &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fTdqyP"&gt;That doesn’t mean that smartwatches will have apps that tell wearers when they have COVID-19. There’s a big difference between being able to detect a general change in the body that could be an illness and detecting a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; illness, says Jennifer Radin, an epidemiologist with the digital medicine division at Scripps Research Translational Institute who’s run studies on wearables and COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnsuIO"&gt;“If your heart rate goes up compared to your normal rate, it can be caused by many other things besides just a viral infection. It could just be that you had too many drinks last night,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="am63TU"&gt;None of the metrics researchers pull from wearables are direct measures of a respiratory illness. “They’re all just markers of if the body is feeling good or not,” Hirten says. The systems are very different from the features on wearable devices that can detect atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. In that case, the wearable is directly measuring the marker — heart rate — that changes in a clear, unique way when someone experiences atrial fibrillation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bvWXkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something like COVID-19 is much more complicated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pbIBY"&gt;“Something like COVID-19 is much more complicated. You’re trying to look for alternative markers in the body that track viral illness,” he says. “But it’s a lot more complicated because those markers also track other things going on in the body.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt1xJ4"&gt;Fitbit saw the overlap with other illnesses on one of its illness prediction projects &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/covid-19-study/"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, which asked participants to take flu tests. There were similar signals in the data when people had the flu as when they had COVID-19, said Conor Heneghan, a director of research at Fitbit. “My instinct is that it’s going to be hard to reliably distinguish between them,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tuHNe"&gt;The task gets even harder as the levels of coronavirus circulating in a community drops. The studies done on wearables and COVID-19 all ran over the past year when the coronavirus was the primary thing making people sick. Flu season &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-ended-flu-season-before-it-started/"&gt;hardly existed&lt;/a&gt;. There was a pretty good chance that, if someone had a certain signature on their wearable that tracked with respiratory illness, the respiratory illness could be COVID-19. As the disease becomes rare, that gets harder. “It’s not as specific anymore as the prevalence drops,” Hirten says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujm3OU"&gt;But tools to alert people when they might be getting sick are still useful, even if they can’t say what someone is sick &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;. Heneghan says that’s the likeliest path forward for Fitbit. “It’ll be a general, hey, something has changed in your physiological signs, you might want to consider that you could be getting ill,” he says. “That’s probably ok from our point of view.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnFD3n"&gt;Oura’s Rai says that the Oura ring serves that function already. The ring gives users a readiness score, which incorporates metrics like sleep quality, heart rate, and body temperature. If it detects that someone’s body temperature is elevated, it gives people the option to pause activity goals and enter a rest mode. That’s the product’s warning light, Rai says. He thinks it’ll be the main approach for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGrf3Z"&gt;“These devices cannot diagnose or treat, but what they can do is say that something’s off in your baseline,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zehIs8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What they can do is say that something’s off in your baseline”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hHdJN6"&gt;Adding those types of features to more wearable devices will take good communication with users, says Radin. “We don’t want to scare people,” she says. It’d be a problem if people who wore smartwatches thought they had COVID-19 any time their data changed. But the devices could explain to users that there is a range of reasons someone might be seeing a change, including illness, she says. “It’s just a heads up that something is out of your normal range, and it could be something to keep an eye on.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds E2E RCS encryption to Messages, emoji mashup suggests, and more for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A drawing of a person using starred messages to save a text containing a Wi-Fi password" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qQwrYIa_TOIBdUjdUJnryPT7GoM=/250x0:1600x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455668/Untitled_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W7balv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-summer-2021"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; seven new features for Android that it says will help improve accessibility and make Assistant Shortcuts more useful, among other things. The new features announced today are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qRcwNg"&gt;End-to-end encryption for Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JwXfkB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.android.com/google-features-on-android/summer-2021/#summer-2021-end-to-end-contents"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; that RCS chats sent through the Messages app will now be end-to-end encrypted. The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;rolled out in beta last November&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems that Google is now releasing it for everyone who has access to RCS. When a message will be encrypted, the send button will have a lock icon on it — that’ll be important to keep an eye out for, as many people you text may not have RCS, or may not be using messages. It’s also worth noting that, according to Google, the feature will only be available for one-on-one conversations, so your group chats won’t be getting the feature at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zJ6ie9"&gt;Android’s Earthquake Alerts are coming to more countries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xvio6R"&gt;Google says its phone-based earthquake detection and alert system will be coming to Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The system, which uses Android phones to create an earthquake detection network that will warn people if they’re in a potentially affected area, originally launched in California, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407676/google-expands-android-earthquake-detection-system"&gt;was made available&lt;/a&gt; in Greece and New Zealand in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLLUeT"&gt;Google says it hopes to bring the feature to more regions over the next year, but that it’s focusing on first making it available to countries that have a high risk of earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EnYDvt"&gt;Starred Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JyxsmQ"&gt;If you get sent a text with important info and want to be able to quickly find it, you’ll be able to “star” it, which will place it in the starred category so you won’t have to scroll back through a conversation to find it. Google says the feature will be rolling out to the Messages app “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpWpNWN8IprNefP67JmbAjvICgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659095/Emoji_kitchen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gboard will suggest your custom emoji creations based on your message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RtEWOV"&gt;Emoji Kitchen recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUzI3"&gt;Starting this summer, Gboard will contextually suggest stickers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21132971/google-emoji-mashups-kitchen-gboard-android-cowboy-monkey-ghost-combination"&gt;created in Emoji Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s tool that lets users create mashups of two different emoji. The suggestions will show up in the Emoji menu for those writing a message in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ji2QTgR5GKHtPRR4g9-mnpmV-ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659110/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_4.05.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-for-io-assistant-tools-and-features.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google uses Strava as an example for the widget view that will be available in Assistant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XTxYQY"&gt;Google Assistant Shortcuts are getting an upgrade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="feUePm"&gt;Google’s Assistant Shortcuts let users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506301/google-assistant-custom-shortcuts-third-party-apps-android"&gt;jump to a specific part of an app&lt;/a&gt;, but developers will now be able to show users information in widget form right in Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utYBHxHA0d7Hawgd-9BSKkCn0PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659138/voice_access_gaze_detect.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell Voice Input to ignore you if you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XVqiVw"&gt;Voice Access won’t take your conversations as input&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaF2b4"&gt;Google’s Voice Access app, which allows people to navigate their phones using their voice, is getting gaze detection so it can tell whether someone is talking to their phone or talking to other people. The feature, which is in beta, will stop taking commands if it detects that you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIvJ40"&gt;Voice Access is also getting improvements when it comes to entering passwords: users will be able to say words like “dollar sign,” and they’ll be translated into the symbol, instead of being written out literally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oHQRDw"&gt;Android Auto gets more customization and creature comforts &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUCnY"&gt;Android Auto users will be able to use their phone to personalize the app launcher and manually manage dark mode. Google’s also adding the ability to quickly scroll to the top of a list, and the scroll bar is getting an A to Z button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EYoR"&gt;Google also says the messaging experience for apps like Messages and WhatsApp has been improved, making it easier to send and read messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ONOK0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 15th, 2:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with information about Google adding end-to-end encryption for RCS chats sent through Messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Switch is getting new Mario Party and WarioWare games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMFKHQDqGBo1VdghD6QIcEgDLGA=/169x0:1089x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456280/mpss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7L3S"&gt;During its E3 Direct, Nintendo announced new entries in the &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; series, both coming to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0eY92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will be a collection of classic &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; boards from the Nintendo 64, featuring (hopefully only the most infuriating) mini-games from both the N64 and GameCube eras. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-party-superstars-switch/"&gt;According to Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, the mini-games can be played through online multiplayer and are compatible with regular controllers (unlike the recent &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-party/"&gt;didn’t allow for the use&lt;/a&gt; of a Pro Controller or Switch Lite unless you had external Joy-Cons.) It will release on October 29th, 2021, for $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVmeVR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Erdq0kiako4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p0YLA4"&gt;Nintendo also announced a new &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; game called &lt;em&gt;Get It Together.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/warioware-get-it-together-switch/"&gt;Nintendo says&lt;/a&gt; it will feature over 200 tiny games, along with a story mode, which can be played alone or with a friend on the same system, or via local wireless co-op. &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; will release on September 10th, 2021, and will sell for $50. You can watch the trailer below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay’s sex ban wipes out an important storefront for queer collectors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a phone showing the eBay logo, set on top of a laptop keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oi0Hh0g4H4vFMBfItL94NXOvcjE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456257/1229865757.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQrWfq"&gt;Carta Monir, an author, publisher, and pornographer, maintains an amateur archive of vintage queer erotica: zines, comics, porn mags, classified ads, and other ephemera. “I think it’s really valuable to preserve and read these artifacts,” she says, “like people speaking to you from the perspective of the way that their community was at the time.” One of her favorite marketplaces for finding these materials is eBay, where she can consistently find a variety of old erotica for fairly cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYvaRB"&gt;But starting today, Monir’s access to these materials is significantly reduced. eBay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436855/ebay-sex-ban-june-15"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt; that it would be removing the “Adult Only” category on June 15th. Under &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/prohibited-restricted-items/restricted-adult-items-policy?id=4278"&gt;the new policy&lt;/a&gt;, sellers aren’t allowed to list “items containing nudity and displays of sexual activitys” on the site. The policy makes exceptions for a few mainstream titles, including &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Playgirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mayfair&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Penthouse&lt;/em&gt;, as long as the listing doesn’t contain nude images. eBay has already expanded that list to include several gay and lesbian magazines, including &lt;em&gt;Playguy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On Our Backs&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BUTT&lt;/em&gt;. But by and large, the policy has the effect of wiping out pornography from one of the internet’s biggest storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9S2PF"&gt;The new rules at eBay echo policy changes over the years at other sites, including Tumblr and Patreon, which have banned or limited adult content. According to Monir and others, those policies tend to have the harshest impacts on queer communities and especially queer people who produce or buy erotic content outside of mainstream porn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Exu5ku"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The “Adult Only” section is already hard to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cjkI"&gt;eBay says its goal is to make adult items available to people “while preventing those who do not wish to view or purchase these items from easily accessing them.” But it’s already difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally stumble on the “Adult Only” section of eBay. It doesn’t appear in drop-down menus and is nested several categories deep. Users have to sign in, agree to continue, and enter a credit card to view it. eBay did not respond to a request for comment on the new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTF0SY"&gt;Adult content bans usually aren’t decisions made entirely by sites themselves and are instead responses to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/4/18126112/tumblr-porn-ban-verizon-ad-goals-sex-work-fandom"&gt;advertising concerns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;strict regulations&lt;/a&gt; from payment processors and credit card companies. In turn, those regulations are often influenced by lobbying from conservatives who point to sex trafficking and “save the children” arguments to cut down on porn. “There are undisguised evangelical anti-porn groups working extremely hard to ban pornography outright, and especially queer pornography,” says Monir, citing organizations like &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxqy4z/petition-shut-down-pornhub-trafficking-hub-earn-it"&gt;Exodus Cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing a section of eBay titled “Adult-Only Items” with subcategories for books, magazine back issues, DVDs, art, collectibles, and other items." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHwF14dwTByR0zu_bUuR2-os7p0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.15.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: eBay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBay’s adult-only storefront.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IDCyWj"&gt;These bans aren’t just bad for collectors, but for artists. In 2008, eBay was one of the first places where Jade, a queer artist, managed to sell their erotic artwork. For several years before they started a webcomic, they would list smutty ink drawings on the site where people would buy them up within a few days. At the time, they remember thinking, “Wow, this is great, you can do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekC0xI"&gt;But things have been more fraught in the years since then. Jade still sells their work on other sites, but always with the worry that their livelihood will disappear if payment processors and credit card companies place further restrictions on the sale of erotica and porn. Patreon increased the enforcement of its adult content regulations in 2018 because of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;pressure from payment partners&lt;/a&gt;, including PayPal, which is known to close people’s accounts and withhold the money in them. Jade requested a pseudonym for this article out of fear that PayPal would shut down their account because of its strict “sexually oriented goods” policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Gubz"&gt;Megan Gedris, another queer artist who makes erotic comics, has also felt the effects of adult content restrictions. Since Tumblr’s 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;adult content ban&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve found it much harder to grow and maintain an audience for their work. They have two separate Patreon pages, one designated 18+ and one that’s not, because Patreon limits the exposure of 18+ accounts, and they worry mixing the two would make all of their work harder to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8zFCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjbOHk"&gt;Policies like the ones at eBay, Patreon, and Tumblr only compound the effects of FOSTA-SESTA, which were ostensibly passed to curb online sex trafficking but have mostly hurt &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom"&gt;sex workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17360458/anti-sex-trafficking-law-fosta-sex-work-education-oschool"&gt;sex educators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/i-fear-loss-community-tumblr-s-new-adult-content-rules-n944196"&gt;queer communities&lt;/a&gt;, and erotic artists. “We know that the way that bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression,” Monir says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGypjS"&gt;Gedris says crackdowns on adult content end up affecting indie creators the most, and it’s those creators who make erotic work that features disabled, fat, non-white, queer, and trans people. It’s important for people who rarely see bodies like theirs in mainstream porn to have access to erotic work that reflects their bodies and experiences. Jade says there’s been a boom of “amazing, beautiful queer erotica” in recent years, but there are still only a handful of publishers that will distribute it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcOoVD"&gt;There are other sites where Monir can dig around for her collection, but she says nothing compares to eBay. “It’s very frustrating because it effectively destroys one of the only reasonably priced large, eclectic marketplaces for vintage and archival content,” she says, “and drives that stuff into more specialized underground, expensive, less accessible venues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y0rdm"&gt;Monir sees queer erotica not just as an important form of expression, but as a way to connect with queer people through history. Porn bans don’t come as a surprise, but the change at eBay hits particularly hard. “Seeing this stuff, feeling the passion and personal attention that was paid to it, and feeling the sense of community that comes from it, is very special,” she says. “And I am sad that people’s ability to just stumble onto stuff like this is going to be so much more curtailed and limited with this large marketplace going away.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt says Cyberpunk 2077 will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNJOyNFFhZMC4mUl-NBHIm8Io8g=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456142/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tgNaCU"&gt;CD Projekt says &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st, slightly more than six months after being removed. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22229742/cyberpunk-2077-returns-to-playstation-store-release-refund-ps4-ps5-cd-projekt-red"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the news came in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-34-2021/"&gt;regulatory disclosure&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s developer, CD Projekt Red’s parent company, saying Sony had agreed to reinstate the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijvrbT"&gt;A CD Projekt Red spokesperson declined further comment about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s return, including what potential bug fixes or other updates the new version offers. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;, Sony confirmed the news but said that it still doesn’t recommend playing the game on PlayStation 4. “Users will continue to experience performance issues with the PS4 edition while CD Projekt Red continues to improve stability across all platforms. [Sony Interactive Entertainment] recommends playing the title on PS4 Pro or PS5 for the best experience,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PJgpy"&gt;CD Projekt executives have said they frequently updated Sony on fixes for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s myriad bugs and performance issues since the game was pulled from the store on December 17th, 2020. The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; for its console, PC, and Google Stadia editions; in late May, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cd-projekt-says-its-still-waiting-for-sonys-approval-to-bring-cyberpunk-back-to-the-playstation-store/"&gt;joint CEO Adam Kiciński told investors&lt;/a&gt; there’d been “visible progress” on stabilizing the game. But Kiciński said Sony would have to make the final call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Juyp0j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; was released in December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397638/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-biggest-game-ever-sales"&gt;to strong sales&lt;/a&gt; but severe technical problems. The game struggled to run on last-generation Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, and players faced numerous (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;frequently hilarious&lt;/a&gt;) bugs on every platform. Microsoft and Sony both offered refunds for the game, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189918/cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-store-listing-warning-label"&gt;added a warning label&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox One owners on its Xbox store. Sony took the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;more drastic step&lt;/a&gt; of pulling &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from its PlayStation Store entirely. Console owners could still buy physical discs, but CD Projekt has said that the digital version’s absence may have &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-playstation-store-removal-may-be-hurting-xbox-and-pc-sales-too-cd-projekt-says/"&gt;slowed down sales&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox and PC as well as PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GnmYp"&gt;CD Projekt Red spent nearly a decade designing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cd-projekt-committed-fixing-cyberpunk-2077-so-it-can-sell-for-years-2021-04-12/"&gt;calls the game&lt;/a&gt; a long-term investment that it can sell for “years to come.” The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-reconsidering-cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-102937559.html"&gt;backed away from plans&lt;/a&gt; for a standalone multiplayer mode, saying it would focus on adding online features to all its games instead. But it’s promised downloadable content for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s single-player campaign, plus a major upgrade for new consoles — including the PlayStation 5 — in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSP2S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 15th, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Sony via&lt;/em&gt; Polygon &lt;em&gt;and response from CD Projekt Red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is releasing a Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lFHH_NSHqTbcqmMmfXs8r1BcKPo=/0x0:2139x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456064/tlozgameandwatch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DA68Su"&gt;For the 35th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo is releasing a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-themed green and gold Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld console with four playable built-in games. You’ll be able to play the first entry in &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series, followed by its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. The fourth game is the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Vermin &lt;/em&gt;game, but with Link’s character imposed over the original character. Additionally, it can be used as a digital clock or timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHeakW"&gt;The handheld will release on November 12th for $49.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430625/game-and-watch-nintendo-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-handheld-console-closer-look"&gt;The previous Game &amp;amp; Watch console&lt;/a&gt; released for Mario’s 35th anniversary had three games, including the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Ball &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mv8f-6fNrGcCkofPoEi2MyIwCOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660319/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FwGyEY"&gt;This version has a similar design and color LCD display found in the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; version, but it’s unique in that it has a start and select button for navigating the &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;games. Unless Nintendo changed its strategy, it likely has a USB-C charging port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz7a08"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
