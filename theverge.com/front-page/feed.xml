    <title>The good and the bad in the government’s case against Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="D74t6l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xUclNM"&gt;After writing about the potential breakup of Facebook for years, it’s somewhat surreal for me to see the prospect actually arrive. But it’s here: &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to sue Facebook for illegally maintaining a monopoly in social networking&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it has used acquisitions and harsh restrictions on third-party developers to prevent competitors from ever gaining a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFMSzW"&gt;If successful, the FTC’s case — which was joined by 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam — could force the company to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp, radically reshaping the digital economy. The move comes less than six weeks after the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/justice-comes-for-google"&gt;filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of also maintaining an illegal monopoly on search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEf4pq"&gt;“For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,” &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-lawsuit-seeking-end-facebooks-illegal"&gt;said Letitia James&lt;/a&gt;, New York’s attorney general. “Today, we are taking action to stand up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook’s illegal behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mplymw"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1910134fbcomplaint.pdf"&gt;read the FTC’s complaint here&lt;/a&gt;; it’s 53 pages long and the only one I made it through today before succumbing to deadline pressure. &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/facebook_complaint_12.9.2020.pdf"&gt;The states’ complaint clocks in at 123 pages&lt;/a&gt;, and I expect to have more to say about it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WXt2cK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I expect the lawsuit that follows will be a years-long affair&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eikZYT"&gt;As presented in the FTC’s complaint, the case against Facebook is relatively straightforward. The government argues that social networks supported by digital advertising are part of a defined market, that Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition in this market, and that it also restricted access to its developer platform to harm competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvz6Qk"&gt;In response, it calls for the company to divest itself of both apps. It also calls for any future Facebook acquisitions to be subject to prior approval from the FTC, for Facebook to stop “imposing anticompetitive conditions on access to APIs and data,” and to file regular compliance reports with the FTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0IWqv"&gt;Facebook, though, calls all that “revisionist history.” In a response credited from the company’s chief counsel, Jennifer Newstead, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/lawsuits-filed-by-the-ftc-and-state-attorneys-general-are-revisionist-history/"&gt;the company protests the government’s attempt to force a breakup despite having declined to stop the acquisitions of either Instagram or WhatsApp at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hw2wf"&gt;“Now, many years later, with seemingly no regard for settled law or the consequences to innovation and investment, the agency is saying it got it wrong and wants a do-over,” Newstead writes. “In addition to being revisionist history, this is simply not how the antitrust laws are supposed to work. No American antitrust enforcer has ever brought a case like this before, and for good reason. The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CGhNO"&gt;I expect the lawsuit that follows will be a years-long affair. (Mark Zuckerberg said as much in a note to employees Wednesday.) In the end, I think the government will likely fail in its attempt to break Facebook up. But I think it will succeed in preventing Facebook from making anti-competitive mergers in the future — and that the ongoing rise of TikTok, and whatever comes after TikTok, will begin to restore balance to the sector of the economy that Facebook dominated for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GzaVON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook made the market less competitive, and now we’ll never know&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hp3WP7"&gt;And I’m glad the government took this case. It begins to change the standard for enforcement of antitrust law in the digital age away from the current one, which focuses on monopolies that raise prices for consumers to one that takes a broader view of consumer harm. Here, from the complaint, is the FTC’s take on what Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram, in particular, has cost us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vl0dQU"&gt;This conduct deprives users of the benefits of competition from an independent Instagram (either on its own or acquired by a third party), including, among other things: the presence of an additional locus of competitive decision-making and innovation; a check on Facebook Blue’s treatment of and level of service offered to users; an alternative provider of personal social networking for users untethered from Facebook’s control; and a spur for Facebook to compete on the merits in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kCJMzc"&gt;As for WhatsApp, the government argues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I0bxwy"&gt;By acquiring WhatsApp, Facebook has suppressed the competitive threat that WhatsApp poses to Facebook’s personal social networking monopoly. Facebook has kept WhatsApp cabined to providing mobile messaging services rather than allowing WhatsApp to become a competing personal social networking provider, and has limited promotion of WhatsApp in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv3wdf"&gt;This can all feel a little abstract, and I’m sure Facebook will argue as much in court. It’s hard to weigh the value of Instagram and WhatsApp as they exist today against what they might have become had they remained independent or been acquired by another corporation. But from the government’s point of view, that’s exactly the point: Facebook made the market less competitive, and now we’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kdm72U"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AL6CYK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aFZwkW"&gt;At the same time, I think the government’s case has a hard road ahead of it. As I wrote this month, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebooks-antitrust-showdown-approaches"&gt;the lawsuit would have felt much more vital two or three years ago&lt;/a&gt;. In the time it took the government to flesh out these arguments, many of which have been made in some form since at least 2014, TikTok was born and acquired 800 million users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWpii5"&gt;Now, the government argues that apps like TikTok aren’t relevant to the market. “Personal social networking is distinct from, and not reasonably interchangeable with, online video or audio consumption-focused services such as YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, and Hulu,” it writes, though TikTok itself is never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8HjLjr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s clear that Facebook faces a real challenge from TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8vzDc"&gt;The idea that these apps are not interchangeable would be news to Facebook. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;I wrote about what happened when TikTok — which children use for an average of 80 minutes a day — was banned in India&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mXKGgt"&gt;On June 29th, India banned TikTok on national security grounds. A week later, in an internal post, a Facebook data scientist reported that usage of the company’s products was surging across India. With TikTok gone, Instagram’s daily users increased 9 percent and were spending 19 percent more time within the app. With TikTok gone, they posted 5 million more stories and sent 214 million more messages on Instagram alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FQmmfX"&gt;When companies are forced to argue that they are not, in fact, monopolies, they often try to define their market in comically broad terms. (Though it was not in an antitrust context, I’m reminded of &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition"&gt;the time Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings said the company’s chief rival is sleep&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxkllU"&gt;And yet, looking at the data, it’s clear that Facebook faces a real challenge from TikTok. Just as WhatsApp once had the potential to grow into a more fully featured social network — something the government explains in careful detail — so does ByteDance’s shortform video app. TikTok’s success is transforming the entire industry; &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/snapchats-million-dollar-idea"&gt;Snapchat just added its own shortform video tab this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pw3foR"&gt;Moreover, as the Stanford Internet Observatory’s Alex Stamos noted, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1336761289004044289?s=20"&gt;the FTC’s push to force Facebook to open its APIs up to competitors raises real privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;. It was only last July that &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-billion-facebook-settlement-record-breaking-history"&gt;the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion for failing to honor the terms of a 2012 consent decree&lt;/a&gt; that forbid it from making deceptive claims about “consumers’ ability to control the privacy of their personal data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObHPY3"&gt;That same FTC now says that placing restrictions on the flow of user data from Facebook to third-party developers is anti-competitive and illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6XCk9"&gt;Also noteworthy: the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-request-to-reconsider-qualcomm-antitrust-case-rejected-by-appeals-court-11603908027"&gt;just lost a similar case against Qualcomm over its licensing practices&lt;/a&gt;. Sources familiar with Facebook’s thinking on the case have pointed to that decision as boding well for its defense, which will likely hold that companies have broad discretion to decide with whom they do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="i6Rbdo"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hPCENP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;III&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QsVpxi"&gt;Whatever the outcome of this case or the government’s case against Google, it’s clear that the United States has entered a much bolder new era of antitrust enforcement. For the sake of competition and consumer benefits, I think that’s a good thing. Even if the cases themselves fall short of their most ambitious aims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qi4NfP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a much different company than it was before the antitrust case&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J1V88p"&gt;It’s tempting to begin to imagine a world where Instagram and WhatsApp are once again operating independently, forcing Facebook to innovate more and copy less. Perhaps we’ll all live in that world someday — and discover that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; comes with trade-offs, too. Or maybe the distraction of a multiyear antitrust case will blind Facebook to the next competitive threat, as the Microsoft antitrust case is often said to have done to that company, and it will stumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAyLp1"&gt;The thing about Microsoft, though, is that it’s still a giant of industry. It’s a much different company than it was before the antitrust case, to be sure. But so would be any company after 20 years in the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC7sjz"&gt;Lots of excited retweets in my timeline from critics and lawmakers today suggest that people believe today’s case could be the beginning of the end for Facebook. But while I expect that this will mark the start of a painful period for the company, in the end, I’d be surprised if the resolution of this case weren’t much less dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 shines on next-gen consoles and Stadia, but older hardware struggles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juVNgshivECpsca10aIjOVJb1GM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490521/pu15d4e891d784977cacbfcbb00c48f133_1603729915_6192392_screenshot_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BsJqNu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just one of the biggest games of the year; it’s also one of the most technically demanding. CD Projekt Red’s ambitious roleplaying game takes place in a huge, dense open world, and — as anyone who has ever played a Bethesda game can attest to — technology is often a step behind the designers in these kinds of experiences. Glitches and bugs are not uncommon occurrences, and early demos are far cries from what the game may look like on the standard hardware most players have in their living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSMDQP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; is also somewhat unique in that it’s releasing across a number of different platforms at launch — nine, to be exact. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;We initially reviewed &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; on PC&lt;/a&gt;, where we ran into a handful of glitches that were annoying but didn’t exactly render the game unplayable. Since then, we’ve been able to test it on two additional platforms to see how it fares, while also looking at reports from the community at large. The consensus? If you’re playing on older hardware, you’re going to want to wait for some fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3sCNdA"&gt;PlayStation 5 and other consoles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="htu6zG"&gt;The first thing to note is there isn’t actually a PS5 version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; — at least not yet, as full next-gen upgrades aren’t expected until next year. Instead, I’ve been running the PS4 version on a PS5. Performance-wise, it’s been great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G0ZNs"&gt;After four hours of play, I haven’t noticed any major frame rate drops, and the visuals are incredible. Unlike on Xbox Series X or Stadia, there aren’t any performance options on PS5 — many modern games let players choose between having a higher resolution or frame rate — but it hasn’t been a huge loss in my experience. Even during extremely busy moments, like a massive shootout or a walk through a tightly packed street market, the game chugged along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8EzMY"&gt;It’s important to note that this is definitely not the case on older hardware. While I haven’t been able to test this, early reports point to the PS4 and Xbox One versions of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; being &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;something of a mess&lt;/a&gt;. Choppy frame rates, weird physics, and intense screen tearing have all been reported. Here are a few more PS4 screenshot comparisons, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and some on Xbox One &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-looking-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-at-1845848627"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t upgraded to a new Xbox or PlayStation, you may want to hold off — or try Stadia — until these issues are ironed out with a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN8Bbf"&gt;That said, I still ran into a handful of technical hiccups during my time with the game, including one hard crash, and another mission I was forced to restart because my AI companion forgot to follow me out of a building. Other issues have been more cosmetic: characters walking through doors, pixelated textures on billboards, and people walking into walls. At one point, I couldn’t drive my car because &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1336798019803635716"&gt;a poor streetpunk became embedded in it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;—Andrew Webster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PrRFui"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;catch me riding in night city &lt;a href="https://t.co/sffdCKnU2c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sffdCKnU2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— andrew webster (@A_Webster) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1336798019803635716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XZfnX4"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fJJqsQ"&gt;It may be hard to believe, but the Google Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; may be the best way to play for most players right now. Unless you have a 20 or 30 Series Nvidia GPU or comparable AMD card or you were lucky enough to get a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, this game will not be performing anywhere close to how it was designed to. That means going the cloud gaming route is a surprisingly viable option if you’re concerned about performance and you also want the added benefits Stadia provides, like playing across multiple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQGmdy"&gt;I’ve played through the first few hours of the game on Stadia, and I’ve been very impressed with how well &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is holding up. Unlike the console versions, the Stadia one has graphical presets to prioritize either resolution or frame rate. And it runs smoothly and looks almost indistinguishable from the console version in my experience on a 50 Mbps-plus internet connection, even over Wi-Fi. (I’ve also been testing the game on PS5.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sxc0gG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cyberpunk on Stadia looks good. There's also performance and quality modes &lt;a href="https://t.co/LmzMnDpyV4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LmzMnDpyV4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1337022401327083521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GKrnk0"&gt;Now, depending on your internet connection and display, you’re most likely not going to get anywhere near the same level of graphic fidelity — at least not consistently — as you would on a next-gen console or a PC running it at medium to high settings. (And no platform can remotely compare to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdAnLas-fMI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;running this game on ultra with ray tracing on PC&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10vJwz"&gt;I’ve also encountered the occasional crash, visual lags and skips, and some audio issues. But the fast boot and load times and the ease with which you can sink right into the game from a Chrome browser on a MacBook Pro has me seriously reconsidering the primary way I want to play this game going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH7nHT"&gt;With Google promising iOS support in the coming weeks, the Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, which requires you have only a Gmail account and pay the $60 to own the game and nothing else, could be a fantastic iPad game if you don’t have a big TV and Chromecast Ultra to enjoy it on otherwise. And while I’m not entirely sure I would play something with this level of complex in-game menus and on-screen text on my iPhone, I could certainly see the benefit of getting in a quick session for a side mission or two if you’re away from home or not near your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Mt2h"&gt;All of this is possible with Stadia, which is an exciting prospect given how accessible the platform is now as a free service. &lt;em&gt;—Nick Statt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The century-long quest for worldwide wireless power</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two hands hold a florescent light and a cellphone next to a Tesla coil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SceGAnCuyAHR6RRGk5BcXXuVC9g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490281/VRG_SCI_185_Thumb_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TytUTt"&gt;In 1902, famed inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla set up shop on Long Island to begin work on his grandest experiment yet. He imagined the construction of a worldwide wireless power delivery system: a network of towers that could light up cities, send communications, and even power aircraft in the sky, all without wires. On the grounds of his lab, he built the first prototype transmission device, a massive structure that came to be known as the Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM12Rc"&gt;Today, of course, we live in a profoundly wired world. Over-the-air communication is ubiquitous. But with a handful of exceptions like cellphones and toothbrushes, we still send and receive electricity through wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAhu8o"&gt;So what went happened to Tesla’s big ambition? We traveled to Wardenclyffe to check out the remains of the lab and to talk to a couple of engineers and physicists about what Tesla had right and wrong. It turns out there &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;some tantalizing progress happening in the world of wireless power transfer today. So... was Tesla onto something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ucFwo"&gt;Watch the video above to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the 2020 Game Awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1002qTtdyze4kqgh-u7j4nVRbVs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490260/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X73D3N"&gt;What better way to finish off 2020 than with a bunch of new game announcements? That’s what you can expect when you watch The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley. As the name implies, it’s also when individuals and companies receive accolades for their work in making the best games of the year. It’ll be hard to top last year’s unveiling of the Xbox Series X, but there should still be a few surprises we won’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMPYsB"&gt;Unlike in years past, this event is online only, so there won’t be any attendees. That should speed up the doling out of awards, making way for the game announcements. It’s what we’re all watching for, right? Here’s how you can tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jJvTZX"&gt;When do the Game Awards start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ieTas0"&gt;It’s all happening on Thursday, December 10th. You can tune in right a 7PM ET / 4PM PT if you don’t want to see any of the pre-show. Arrive a half-hour early if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p8ot2E"&gt;Where can I watch the Game Awards?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H3sg5B"&gt;The better question is where can you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; watch the Game Awards? The ceremony / conference is happening on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWz6v-UAs8Q"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (which is where you’ll want to watch for the exclusive 4K HDR stream) as well as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;, and many more places. You can watch it in &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; or through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fevent%2F765464370709640%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22163974%2F2020-game-awards-how-to-watch-time-date-premieres#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Venues if you feel like watching it in VR&lt;/a&gt;. If you live outside of the US, &lt;a href="https://thegameawards.com/watch"&gt;here’s where the Game Awards will stream in your region&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon boosts renewable energy purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Continues To Hire As Demand Soars During Coronavirus Shutdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYVSdXojtDp05yoZKnAAr6gBnFs=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490023/1218796210.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Fulfillment Center with solar panels in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s884kP"&gt;Amazon now claims that it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. The company’s investment in wind and solar projects grew to 6.5 GW, enough to power 1.7 million homes in the US for a year. That surpasses Google, which previously said it held the title as the biggest corporate buyer with &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-biggest-renewable-energy-purchase-ever/"&gt;5.5 GW of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; projects under contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ckgaTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon surpasses Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cpAqp"&gt;The move is part of Amazon’s commitment to limit the damage it does to the planet. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;pledged to reach net-zero&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide emissions by 2040, meaning it will take measures to reduce its planet-heating pollution as much as possible and then cancel out the rest with carbon offsets. It also said its physical infrastructure would run completely on renewables by 2030, a goal that CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is now on track to meet five years early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeCZZj"&gt;The online retail behemoth announced 26 new solar and wind projects in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the US. That brings its total to 127 renewable energy projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR0sXu"&gt;“I couldn’t be more proud of all the teams across Amazon that continue to work hard, smart, and fast to get these projects up and running,” Bezos said in a &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-becomes-worlds-largest-corporate-purchaser-renewable"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. Bezos has pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; of his own money to fund action on climate change, while Amazon started a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;$2 billion&lt;/a&gt; climate pledge fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X04FGE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s carbon footprint has continued to rise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPl9np"&gt;Despite the big claims Amazon is making about its sustainability goals, the company’s carbon footprint has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to rise&lt;/a&gt;. Its greenhouse gas emissions grew by &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=7&amp;amp;imprToken=e6bb2663-6cb7-7337-d91&amp;amp;name=sustainability-all-in-june-2020&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21064468%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD"&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 as sales increased. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;more people shopping online&lt;/a&gt; this year, Amazon’s profit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic — a telltale sign that Amazon’s pollution could keep growing, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook outage disrupted Messenger and Instagram DMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFcDkPS2m_e12Yq7Sob3IL10dSU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489977/acastro_200305_1777_messenger_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7NiBq"&gt;You might have run into trouble messaging someone on Facebook or Instagram this morning. A service outage took down Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs for many users, with new messages failing to send and old messages failing to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuM82S"&gt;The outage appears to have started around 4:30AM ET and gotten worse (or, at least, more widely noticed) in the following hours. The website Downdetector, which monitors website outages, showed a spike in users reporting issues with these services that peaked around 8:30AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcJsMM"&gt;Facebook says the disruptions have since been resolved. “Earlier today, some people have experienced trouble sending or receiving messages on Messenger, Instagram or Workplace Chat. The issue has since been resolved and we apologize for any inconvenience,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV3NFF"&gt;Service outages happen every now and then, but the breadth of this latest disruption is in many ways Facebook’s own doing. The company has been integrating Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs. Now that they share infrastructure, it seems that an outage for one may mean an outage for the other, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bR1kE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook says the outage has now been resolved. This story has been updated to reflect that the outage has passed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica’s SL2-S trades resolution for speed and sensitivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBp3wr7dJz1D0YkTaJu_LbpYn8=/0x2:6000x4002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489968/SL2_S_Ambients_CL_7_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Leica SL2-S | Photo: Leica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MY0BzY"&gt;Leica is expanding its line of full-frame interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras with the new SL2-S. As its name implies, the SL2-S is a variation of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950534/leica-sl2-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-ibis-price-specs-announcement-features"&gt;SL2 that came out last year&lt;/a&gt; and it shares many features and similarities with that camera. But that S tagged on to the end means it is something different, and it might as well stand for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqphul"&gt;The SL2-S has the same body, design, build quality, LCD touchscreen, viewfinder, battery, in-body image stabilization, and autofocus system as the SL2. What’s different is its sensor: instead of the high-resolution 47.3-megapixel chip found in the SL2, the SL2-S has a brand-new, backside-illuminated 24-megapixel sensor. That lower resolution allows it to capture up to 25 frames per second with its electronic shutter (9 frames per second with the mechanical), and the backside illumination gives it a greater ISO range and better low-light performance over the SL2. It’s the first backside-illuminated sensor to be used by Leica.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDmNfA8ETDxgUbKUO8-PfNcJSWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158513/SL2_S_Ambients_CL_1_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SL2-S has the same design and weatherproofing as the SL2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82TpCh"&gt;The SL2-S can shoot at up to ISO 100,000, and the company claims it has both lower noise and better color when at extremely high ISO levels. The camera’s multi shot mode can combine up to 8 shots into a single 96-megapixel image if you find you’re needing more resolution. Thanks to its 4GB internal buffer, the SL2-S can shoot continuous bursts of JPEG images at 9 frames per second until the SD cards in its two UHS-II slots are full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwj5VV"&gt;Like the SL2, the SL2-S has separate photo and video modes, allowing you to customize the camera’s functions and settings for each task and switch between them. It can capture 4K 10-bit 4:2:2 and Cinema 4K ProRES footage up to 30fps to an SD card or up to 60fps to an external recorder through its full-size HDMI port. It also has L-log recording with two built-in LUTs to make it easier to see what the edited version will look like. Leica says it plans to release more LUTs in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDoYIl"&gt;Aside from its internal differences, the SL2-S is almost a direct clone of the SL2, with the same, chunky milled aluminum top and bottom connected to a magnesium alloy frame. Its 5.76-megapixel OLED viewfinder is only outclassed by the one in Sony’s recent A7S III, and the body has IP54 dust and water protection and is guaranteed to work in temps as low as negative 10 Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n9dJOelSdXp7luZbHPF1cr7zV7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158512/SL2_S_BTS_CL_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SL2-S has dedicated modes for photo and video settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i0tR0N"&gt;Leica says that it is planning to release a firmware update in the first half of 2021 that will add a number of new features, including an improved autofocus algorithm, focus tracking, internal 4K 60p recording, Long-GOP recording, segmented video, automatic follow focus, a waveform monitor, tally mode, color bars, and an enhanced live view for low-light shooting. The SL2-S (as well as the SL2 and S3) are now fully supported in Capture One, allowing photographers another software option for tethered shooting in addition to Lightroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMrQqT"&gt;The SL2-S is slated to begin shipping immediately for $4,895, about $1,100 less than the SL2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlFdgS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods Max first look: lots to prove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpHqQubstLK_bgtpOF_Eff-1kao=/0x249:1000x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489888/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At $549, they need to deliver more than just good sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Xczc3j"&gt;I’ve been playing with Apple’s new $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones since yesterday afternoon, and so far they sound very nice and fit very comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMlMIj"&gt;They also — I have to say this — have a distinct smell, like a funky riff on new-car smell. I am pretty sure that’s a byproduct of the memory foam earpads rolling off the manufacturing line and straight into a shipping box to my house, and I’m reliably told it will fade away over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5UCFZ"&gt;I would probably not tell you what a pair of $100 headphones smells like. But at $550, I feel compelled to note that the AirPods Max are a multisensory experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max headband" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jJQLigb9MPDQnoYs35H51arBnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159216/npatel_201209_4332_0036.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2rVS8D"&gt;Design-wise, the AirPods Max are an interesting blend of classic only-Apple design flourishes and odd incongruities. The headband is stainless steel covered in white rubbery material, with a “breathable mesh knit canopy” across the top; Apple says this distributes the weight of the headphones more evenly across your head. (I can’t say it feels very much different than my Sony WH-1000XM2s, but it’s possible I just have a very large head.) The headband connects to the earcups with adjustable stainless-steel extensions culminating in a pleasantly spring-loaded hinge, all of which is nicer than any other premium headphones I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max bottom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcDSPV8w6-QPYFuGbVVpXtYrgBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159219/npatel_201209_4332_0033.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y45TJP"&gt;The fairly large earcups are where things get a little messier. I have the silver AirPods Max, and the vast expanse of flattish aluminum does not look at first glance like $550 — it’s possible the other colors look more premium, but you would be forgiven for thinking these are plastic until you touch them and feel the coldness of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnrWIw"&gt;The earcups are not smooth, unbroken surfaces. There are 10 slots of various shapes and sizes cut into the earcup shells. Seven of those are microphones: six used for noise-cancellation and another for voice calls. (There are another two mics inside the earcups.) These slots are not symmetrical; the top of the left earcup has one long slot, one short one, and then three more slots on the bottom along with a long gray plastic antenna line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YRqQ2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review: taking back the crown","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"},{"title":"Sony WH-1000XM4 review: the best noise-canceling headphones get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LJh2zE"&gt;There are two slots on top of the right earcup, and there are three more on the bottom, in addition to a small status LED and the Lightning port, which Apple chose over USB-C to be more convenient for all the iPhone users out there. The AirPods Max can be charged to its full 20-hour battery life in two hours from the standard 5W iPhone brick, and run for 90 minutes after just five minutes on the charger. (There’s no fast-charging available, even if you use a USB-C to Lightning cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXA48ZX3DznrRvhOK_bRyXXMk14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159220/npatel_201209_4332_0029.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown compared to Apple Watch digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-MdApQafu_eT_aX8HAeMOhg3Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159327/npatel_201209_4332_0058.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmCN7U"&gt;The right earcup also has a button to switch between noise-cancelling and transparency mode, as well as a Digital Crown volume control you can press to play and pause music, and hold to invoke Siri. (You can also just say “Hey Siri,” which worked well enough.) One note on the crown: it’s much bigger than the one that appears on an Apple Watch, so it doesn’t feel too awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHINMW"&gt;All of this is to say: there’s a lot going on visually with the AirPods Max, much more so than you’d expect from a pair of $550 Apple headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEs7cF"&gt;One thing you will not find: a 3.5mm or 2.5mm analog audio input, which is standard issue on noise-canceling headphones at this price point — that’s how you plug into an airplane seat-back entertainment system to watch the movie. Apple knows this is a common use case, because it is selling a $35 3.5mm-to-Lightning cable for exactly that purpose. That brings you to $585 for the AirPods Max, which is just $15 less than an entire iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEsjtRbdI_mi8xja_w72EzH2zyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159326/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EZT5t8fkJEkWPnKf2xtfgq5ZUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159325/npatel_201209_4332_0063.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gs7QJy"&gt;The memory-foam earcups are very comfortable, and attach magnetically — they remain firmly in place, but come out easily when you need them to. Underneath, there’s white plastic, and a window for the sensor that detects your ears — the music automatically stops when you take the headphones off, or even just lift one earcup to talk to someone. The AirPods Max don’t have a power button, which is very Apple; they just go to sleep when they haven’t been on your head for a while, and then wake up when you put them back on. Clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The back of the AirPods Max case exposes where the material comes through itself and is glued in place.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwopur"&gt;I have no idea what’s going on with the AirPods Max case, which is a goofy one-piece contraption that’s folded and glued over on itself to form a case. It looks very much like a purse when wrapped around the headphones, which is at once fun and clever and also not the point of a headphones case that needs to survive in a backpack. It does not appear very protective, feels like it will get dirty fast, and generally does not hold a candle to the nice hard cases that come with almost every other set of premium headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfBRLU"&gt;It is one of the cheaper-feeling things Apple has ever made, in my estimation — the second in a trend that started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;the MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. I hope there is not a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdN0YCZxjqQakcK-QGhVd9SF1AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159213/npatel_201209_4332_0043.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case interior" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7M5FimbBvOA3OSPoBGM0Hpin6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159210/npatel_201209_4332_0047.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NT1X03"&gt;Sound-wise, I’ve had fun listening to the AirPods Max for a few hours — they’re crisp and bright, with a pleasingly wider soundstage than my Sony headphones, and no distortion at all, even at max volume. We’ll have a full review of these soon, including tests of spatial audio and Apple’s claim of Atmos surround sound support, so stay tuned for that. But for now, rest assured the AirPods Max sound more than good enough to compete with other high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqKGEP"&gt;Of course, those competing headphones are all cheaper — much cheaper — than the AirPods Max. The newest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; are regularly on sale for $300, sound very good, and have a 10-hour-longer battery life. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt; are $339, also sound very good, and have brand cachet that’s known in first-class cabins the world over. (They also both have audio-in jacks for those seat-back entertainment systems.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PcYNBI"&gt;Whether Apple has actually done enough here to justify the staggering premium over the competition is an open question that it’ll take us a little more time reviewing to answer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels globally, turning the whole app into a catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHybIGMiH7UY4FjCzLf4tnmrzHo=/0x0:2436x1624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489566/shoppingreels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFdEt3"&gt;Instagram is covering its app with shopping content. Today, the company announced that shopping is rolling out to Reels, its TikTok copycat product, around the world. It announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21499179/facebook-reels-shopping-igtv-retail"&gt;test of this feature&lt;/a&gt; in October. Businesses and creators will be able to tag products when they create Reels, and viewers can tap through those tags to buy or save them. A branded content tag is also available for influencers who are paid for their posts. With this rollout, Instagram now has shopping available in every format on the app — the Feed, Stories, IGTV, and Live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksGWCC"&gt;Shopping is important to Instagram, and Facebook more broadly, as it looks to diversify its revenue. Ads are the primary way both platforms make money, but shopping presents an opportunity to profit off sales fees. In Instagram’s case, people already look for product inspiration, so giving them the option to buy directly from the app streamlines that process. It even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;completely redesigned&lt;/a&gt; the home screen to emphasize shopping and Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3JBtA"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok is &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok"&gt;partnering with Shopify&lt;/a&gt; to launch new shopping features, including a test that would let Shopify users tag stores in their videos with a “shop now” button. Reels only widely launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; and is already being used for shopping, which speaks to just how important commerce is to the company and how badly it wants to beat TikTok to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Amazon fined €135M over misuse of cookies by French data watchdog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WZKKYS0EoNHTMAQGHoXJRhr-_4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489546/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pFgRMc"&gt;France’s data protection regulator, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or CNIL, has fined &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-financial-penalties-60-million-euros-against-company-google-llc-and-40-million-euros-google-ireland"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-financial-penalty-35-million-euros-imposed-company-amazon-europe-core"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; a total of €135 million (around $163 million) between them for violating the country’s data protection laws. Google was fined a total of €100 million (around $121 million), while Amazon was fined €35 million (around $42 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO6I4D"&gt;In both cases, CNIL’s complaints were similar. It said that in the past, when users visited either company’s French website, cookies — including some used for advertising — were placed on their devices without prior consent. Although both have since updated their websites to require a user’s consent before placing cookies, the regulator criticized their cookie information banners for not providing enough information, or for making it clear enough that visitors can turn down these cookies. The regulator gave both a deadline of three months to fix the outstanding issues, or risk being fined €100,000 (around $120,000) per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVPOKH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regulator’s complaints about the two companies were similar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fl6oIZ"&gt;Responding to news of the fine, a spokesperson from Amazon said the company disagreed with CNIL’s decision. “We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators and fully comply with all applicable laws in every country in which we operate,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfUlMx"&gt;Google also pushed back against the regulator, and said it stands by its efforts to provide information about tracking and control to users. “Today’s decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving. We will continue to engage with the CNIL as we make ongoing improvements to better understand its concerns,” a spokesperson from Google said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDgTQt"&gt;The latest fines provide more evidence that European regulators are serious about enforcing data privacy rules, which have strengthened considerably in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-10/google-amazon-fined-163-million-by-french-data-watchdog?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that CNIL’s latest fine for Google is double its previous record fine, also levied against Google. Google has so far been fined over €8 billion in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15872354/google-eu-fine-antitrust-shopping"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt; brought by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
