    <title>Faraday Future’s best shot at redemption may be a SPAC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYH40X"&gt;Despite a whirlwind of electric vehicle SPAC mergers in the last few months, there’s still one startup flying solo that’s arguably the best-positioned. Yes, Faraday Future is still on the market — though maybe not for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMnv2N"&gt;Sure, Faraday Future is distressed and its electric SUV is outrageous, but it developed valid technology over the last few years that is further along than what some competitors have. It will take a lot of money to get that vehicle over the proverbial finish line. Lucky for Faraday Future, though, money is now incredibly easy to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQBMR7"&gt;In the last seven months alone, a half-dozen startups have gone public or announced plans to go public by merging with SPACs, or special-purpose acquisition companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;publicly traded investment funds that only exist to acquire other companies&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faraday-m-a-spac-idUSKBN26Q36M"&gt;said since October&lt;/a&gt; that it’s looking to go public by merging with a SPAC, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-10/faraday-future-is-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-spac-merger?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=deals&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-deals&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on January 10th&lt;/a&gt; that the startup is in talks with one run by a New York City real estate investor. Faraday Future also hired its first chief financial officer in three years, in a potential nod to there finally being some serious work to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="68JpaE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SPACs have made money incredibly easy to come by&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIzl4I"&gt;If Faraday Future doesn’t pull off a SPAC merger, it won’t be for lack of trying. The startup has entertained investors looking to take companies public since the beginning of the SPAC boom last June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkQ4Hm"&gt;One group toured Faraday Future’s idle factory in Hanford, California, on June 26th, according to emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That group then immediately departed from the local airport for Jackson, Wyoming, according to the emails and flight records. The Jackson area is home to investor Daniel Hennessy’s SPAC, which eventually merged with rival startup Canoo. Faraday Future brought another unidentified investor group through the factory in September, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. (Emails to Nicholas Petruska, the chief financial officer of Hennessy’s SPAC, were not returned. Faraday Future did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4xP7wW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla’s success helped aim a fire hose of cash at EV startups in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hwrUea"&gt;But now there’s a CFO in place, and negotiations are reportedly happening. Yes, Faraday Future has lost most of the people who worked on its electric SUV, the FF91. And yes, it has burned through $2 billion to date. But this is the best chance the startup has had to bring in outside help since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/31/18162827/faraday-future-evergrande-settlement-restructuring-china-ev-investor"&gt;a deal with a Chinese conglomerate Evergrande fell apart in spectacular fashion&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6Nhxc"&gt;It may be hard to believe Faraday Future could go public considering the troubles it’s had over the last four years — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18088438/faraday-future-electric-cars-ev-news-layoffs-bankruptcy"&gt;which &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has documented extensively&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also kind of easy to believe the company will make that leap given the momentum these mergers have created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SuXiFs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday Future has been hosting SPAC groups since last June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gejrgf"&gt;That movement — sparked by Tesla’s success in 2020 but supercharged by the rise of retail traders who trade stocks on Robinhood and speculate on Reddit — has already turned startups on the brink into companies with valuations of a billion dollars or more, despite &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/688d8472-c404-42d6-88b7-fbd475e50f7c"&gt;many of them not making any money yet&lt;/a&gt;. And some of those that &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; headed for collapse are still going public with unproven technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqFLhp"&gt;You’d be hard-pressed to find a company more on the brink than Faraday Future. As for the tech, Faraday Future’s battery pack, motors, and inverter were all designed by the widely respected team that created the General Motors EV-1, the first attempted mass-market electric car. The company has said its SUV is essentially 85 percent complete, meaning it’s ahead of peers like Fisker and Lordstown Motors, which have only recently started testing their first prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWH2Rg"&gt;If there is a knock on the technology Faraday Future has created since its inception in 2014, it’s that employees were given too much freedom to work since founder Jia Yueting — who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18130543/faraday-future-jia-yueting-leeco-leshi-debt-china"&gt;prone to lighting money on fire&lt;/a&gt; — set them all toward the goal of creating a vehicle that costs close to $200,000. But the pack and the motor layout are scalable, meaning smaller versions that cost less are possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Btanyi"&gt;In fact, Faraday Future was one of the first EV companies to design one of these modular so-called “skateboard” platforms, where all the tech that’s crucial to powering an EV is integrated into the base of the car and can fit differently sized vehicles. It’s just never had the chance to execute on the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lB6krQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday’s tech is further along than that of many rival EV startups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oXCf2"&gt;None of this guarantees Faraday Future will succeed. Selling an extremely expensive SUV that also costs a lot to manufacture will make it hard to turn a profit — even in China, where the startup also wants to operate. By the company’s own admission, it still needs some $850 million &lt;em&gt;just to put the vehicle into production&lt;/em&gt;. It has a long way to go to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tPqi8"&gt;That may not matter so much to investors who would rather tap the SPAC boom while there’s still money to be made, though. There’s value in Faraday Future’s tech (and the patent portfolio behind it), and business plans can always be adjusted. To wit, the new chairman of Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;has refocused the company on selling its technology to — and partnering with — other businesses&lt;/a&gt; instead of jumping too deep into passenger vehicles. For Faraday Future, like these other companies, merging with a SPAC is the quickest path to fresh funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkmIca"&gt;What could still hold Faraday Future back is its most persistent obstacle: Jia himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnB4HF"&gt;The startup’s new CEO has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;worked to box in the tycoon founder since taking the helm in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, including setting up a management committee that is now in charge of making decisions. This effort was aided by Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268043/court-jia-yueting-faraday-future-bankruptcy-plan"&gt;declaring personal bankruptcy to settle some $3 billion in debt he still owes in China&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement he ultimately came to was to give each of those creditors a slice of a new trust that holds his controlling shares of Faraday Future, simultaneously offering restitution while also giving up “control” over the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sJdFgN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gBhEVr"&gt;But over the years, Jia has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;filled Faraday Future’s ranks with people loyal to him&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom are either former employees of his previous company, tech conglomerate LeEco, or family members. And according to his bankruptcy filings, his nephew still holds veto power over the management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="42PGyc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Faraday Future goes public, what happens to its founder?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHJcW2"&gt;Jia has maintained that he wants to return to China, and a successful public listing that helps make his creditors somewhat whole could help make that happen. After all, he only turned up in the US a few years ago after being named to a debtor blacklist there. Whether the autocratic government would welcome him back, or what would happen when he got there, is hard to say. The &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-22/jack-ma-s-empire-in-crisis-after-china-halts-ant-group-ipo"&gt;recent crackdown on Alibaba’s Jack Ma&lt;/a&gt;, a far more visible and successful businessman, doesn’t particularly bode well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LoKOr"&gt;If Faraday Future fails to merge with the real estate SPAC, there are plenty of others eager to dole out cash. A SPAC started by investment fund Churchill Capital is currently in talks with Saudi-backed EV startup Lucid Motors, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously targeted DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s playing the field. If Lucid Motors decides to stay private or follow the traditional IPO route, maybe that SPAC will turn its attention to Faraday Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCU6ey"&gt;Perhaps the most poetic, though, would be one that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k8n902/ccac_rumors_with_ev_company/"&gt;Reddit and Twitter users&lt;/a&gt; have baselessly speculated on: the SPAC created by CITIC Capital, the asset management arm of the massive state-owned investment company CITIC Group. What better way for Jia to make good with the Chinese government than to give it a direct interest in Faraday Future’s success?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC is relaunching its mobile app to focus on comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="batman and superman" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07m68H9mf7IBY4suQJ_Gfsjpegc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690316/batman_superman-dc-comics.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DC Comics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="diWI9c"&gt;DC is shaking up its comics app on January 21st and relaunching it as DC Universe Infinite. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17589522/dc-universe-titans-streaming-service-san-diego-comic-con-2018"&gt;original DC Universe&lt;/a&gt; featured television shows and comics, but now that DC shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369285/dc-universe-original-shows-hbo-max-changes-streaming-lineup"&gt;have moved to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, the company has decided to refocus the app on comics and the “fan community,” while keeping the same $7.99-a-month price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjiKI8"&gt;DC Universe Infinite will have DC’s catalog and early access to comics six months after they’re released physically in stores. Additionally, DC says the comic reader in its app has been improved, and users will have more options to curate custom lists of titles. The app will also have a customizable icon and a widget for iOS 14 so you can get back into whatever you were reading faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7O979L"&gt;In terms of features, DC Universe Infinite is most similar to &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited"&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, which is Marvel’s $9.99-a-month take on an exclusive comics service. Infinite undercuts Marvel by keeping its cost at $7.99 a month (or $74.99 a year), and it might help to make it popular as WarnerMedia rolls out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;its plans for the DC universe(s) in film and TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jh4e56"&gt;As extended universes expand, comic apps are as much for comic book fans as they are for anyone trying to appreciate all of the lore that’s layered into each new superhero outing. Now that HBO Max is the home for DC superheroes in film and TV, and DC Universe Infinite for comics, WarnerMedia’s plans are starting to make more sense. Whether fans will be willing to pay a combined $22 a month for both services will be the real test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We don’t object to this Reddit bot that turns arguments into Ace Attorney videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image from the bot’s video, displaying an argument about CDPR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSMIcLXRfa9pH6hqSdWNiqHumc4=/0x0:2798x1865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690290/Screen_Shot_2021_01_19_at_9.40.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmjnmI"&gt;Someone had to do it: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/objection-bot/"&gt;there’s now a bot&lt;/a&gt; that turns Reddit arguments into scenes from &lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt;, complete with music and the iconic “OBJECTION!” intercuts. It’s from those moments that it draws its name: objection-bot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lRhm"&gt;Users can summon the bot by typing “!objection-bot” under a thread that would work as an Ace Attorney courtroom scene, and the bot will generate a video based on the posts. It feels a little like shouting “worldstar!” but on Reddit. You can see &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/gjmp6ds?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;an excellent &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-related example&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="68QFn6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/fdxzag" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6e5BY"&gt;The genius behind the bot &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/"&gt;is Reddit user oppai_suika&lt;/a&gt;, who was kind enough to also post the source code. They also note &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/gjmp6ds?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;in a comment&lt;/a&gt; that the number one and two fighters get assigned as Phoenix and Edgeworth, respectively, and everyone else is assigned a character randomly. Other characters from the series show up, too, egging on the other posters or coming in with takes too hot to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbRk4V"&gt;The first post from the bot was four days ago, but it’s been busy since then. There’s already a dedicated subreddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/"&gt;r/Objectionbotbattles&lt;/a&gt;, for users to post the best of the bot’s results. One that had me laughing out loud &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/comments/kzyk9u/its_all_going_off_in_the_courtroom_when_people/"&gt;re-creates the experience of being stuck in a reply-all email chain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzHL0d"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-01-19T19:18:54.667944+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/comments/kzyk9u/its_all_going_off_in_the_courtroom_when_people/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;It's all going off in the courtroom when people keep using reply all!&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/"&gt;Objectionbotbattles&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85H3Zp"&gt;The bot only supports certain subreddits, but it includes &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the important ones: r/politicalcompassmemes, r/vegan, r/MechanicalKeyboards, and r/JoeRogan. (In all seriousness, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/objection-bot/comments/kz97be/these_are_the_subreddits_i_support_at_the_moment/"&gt;a reasonably long list&lt;/a&gt;.) Obviously, it also supports r/aceattorney, and it’s been called upon to dramatize &lt;a href="https://streamable.com/7u7enj"&gt;arguments about its source material&lt;/a&gt; as well (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/kxaber/is_it_worth_to_finish_the_game/gjui9rf/?context=3"&gt;based on this thread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlW01z"&gt;Sometimes Reddit arguments can feel like courtroom dramas, with people squabbling over technicalities, intent, and the definitions of words. Now, that experience has been digitized with some of our favorite video game attorneys, and it is truly glorious.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pledges $20 million for Fortnite esports in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite World Cup Finals - Final Round" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64K2F2CVZd5wFQaacAHvdMqil6I=/1x0:3961x2640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690179/1164792889.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akcYsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic says that, for 2021, the game’s competitive scene will have a prize pool of $20 million. That’s a step up from last year’s total of $17 million — though it’s not as massive as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"&gt;the 2019 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where $30 million was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1j3tE3"&gt;The news comes as Epic provided details on the latest season of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Champion Series, the game’s highest level of competition. The developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152744/epic-fortnite-world-cup-2021-canceled-fncs"&gt;previously said that all competitions would take place online&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it revealed more details about the schedule: qualifiers will kick off on February 4th, with the finals starting on March 12th. In a nod to the global nature of the game, there will also be three new, separate broadcasts with commentary in French, German, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rN7fjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our overall goal is to create better consistency.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdDuDn"&gt;There are a number of other format and scoring changes; you can check &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/2021-and-chapter-2-season-5-fncs-details"&gt;Epic’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; for the full rundown. “Our overall goal is to create better consistency throughout the year and tie the 2021 seasons together for a more cohesive experience,” Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y3sAkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Fortnite World Cup Finals were a victory lap for Epic Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d8Kwxc"&gt;As for the prize pool, there will be four seasons of the FNCS in 2021, with a total of $3 million in prize money for each. But Epic says there are additional tournaments on the way. “We also have plans for mid and end of year competitions where we will bring together the top performing FNCS players in each region in multiple competitive formats,” the developer explains. The remaining $8 million will serve as the prize money for these yet-to-be-determined tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0rQx"&gt;Meanwhile, earlier today, Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;a new partnership&lt;/a&gt; that will see 23 different professional soccer teams featured in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned bats are trendsetters in tracking tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A small bat with its wings spread in flight against a dark background. On its back is a sensor that looks like a little battery pack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQIsjGG_3YwNgYPGQ9CI75ARXWs=/0x1028:2139x2454/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689622/dulog_tag.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Look at this bat’s little backpack! | Image: dulog&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCmX19"&gt;Bats are elusive little creatures, which makes them the perfect subjects for scientists to try out new animal tracking systems. This is great news for me specifically, because I love both bats &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; seeing images of animals with goofy little trackers on them. How can you look at &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seals-high-tech-hats-are-collecting-climate-data-antarctic-180973709/"&gt;these seals with ridiculous antenna hats&lt;/a&gt; and not laugh at least a little?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9Alnc"&gt;One of the latest innovations in tracking wearables is the &lt;a href="https://dulog.net/"&gt;dulog&lt;/a&gt; system, a wireless sensor network built by biologist Simon Ripperger and engineer Niklas Duda, which was put to the test in several bat-tracking studies over the past few years. Now that the dulog has proven its mettle with bats, which are tiny, nocturnal, and generally tough to observe, the pair believe it could be useful in monitoring all kinds of animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXZ5Bg"&gt;“If your project can succeed with bats, it can probably work with most species,” says Ripperger in &lt;a href="https://www.silabs.com/community/blog.entry.html/2021/01/19/iot_heroes_createwirelessnetworktostudybats-yK5y"&gt;a recent Silicon Labs blog post&lt;/a&gt;. When he first got started in the bat-tracking business, he saw that his adviser was “essentially running behind bats, chasing them with an antenna.” I will be holding that image in my mind for a while, but Ripperger and Duda think the dulog’s tiny sensors will make animal studies easier — less chasing required. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bat with reddish fur sits on a tree branch with a small sensor on its back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtZa2ot7_G7_6NiRJNo4wjNVEPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244912/Nyctalus_noctula__adult_Berlin___Kopie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: dulog&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny common noctule bat wearing the latest in sensor fashion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Y5QU"&gt;The data collected with dulog tags can be downloaded remotely, meaning after the initial attachment, scientists don’t have to wrangle animals to retrieve data from their tags. They’re also smaller and lighter than current GPS tracking systems that enable remote downloads — the bat pictured above would fit in the palm of your hand, and the sensor weighs less than a gram. What’s most exciting to Ripperger is that the tags “talk to each other,” meaning they can be used to track the social behavior of tagged animals based on their proximity to each other over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmvMIl"&gt;So far, the dulog system has been used in studies that have produced some delightful findings: &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0884"&gt;mother bats guide their pups&lt;/a&gt; from roost to roost, formerly captive bats maintain their social relationships &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219313648"&gt;when released in the wild&lt;/a&gt;, and bats exhibit &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/6/1296/5937165"&gt;“social distancing” behavior&lt;/a&gt; when they’re sick. After these bat-based successes, Ripperger and Duda hope to soon start selling the system to researchers for use with other animals, both large and small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeZQ8t"&gt;In terms of possible applications for the system, “the sky is the limit,” says Ripperger. I am not involved in any important animal research, but personally I would love to hook a tag to my dog to keep tabs on her general mischief. I imagine they would also be helpful for keeping track of which squirrels are the biggest offenders in eating my bird seed. For now, they’re not available for direct order, so I will leave the science to the scientists and continue to enjoy pictures of animals with backpacks and hats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some M1 Mac users reporting screensaver takeover bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7vtFS1TG21JsZ2cPzfJfdtmqSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689511/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zx4UVA"&gt;I picked up a new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and I’ve absolutely loved it so far. It’s really speedy and the battery is fantastic. But I’ve been dealing with one nagging issue. Every once in a while, for reasons that I haven’t been able to figure out, a screensaver will suddenly take over the entire computer — despite the fact that I never use a screensaver. And frustratingly, the screensaver renders my laptop inoperable until I completely close the screen and reopen it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf8SGP"&gt;It seems I’m not the only one seeing this bug, according to this &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/18/m1-macs-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;. Others have shared similar issues with M1-equipped MacBook Airs, Pros, and Minis on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29296369#post-29296369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-is-going-on-here-screensaver-like-animation-spontaneously-appears-video.2273013/?post=29338930#post-29338930"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit (in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k3mmwt/macbook_air_m1_2020_display_issue_screen_show_sup/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/k18gih/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_it_just_recently/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;), and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252083925?page=1"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. And one user on &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; said they’ve &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-m1-macs-affected-by-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug.2280806/?post=29517694#post-29517694"&gt;seen the bug&lt;/a&gt; on their 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has an Intel chip, so perhaps this is a problem with macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd35WL"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N3CoMocJ7Rw"&gt;a video of the bug&lt;/a&gt;, shared by &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29307255#post-29307255"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; forum member dawideksl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="B36v0c"&gt;Many people reporting the issue in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; say they have multiple accounts on the same computer. And for what it’s worth, I’ve set up two accounts on my MacBook Air. One user on Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996?answerId=254255624022#254255624022"&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; disabled Fast User Switching and said they weren’t seeing the screensaver, so perhaps that’s a workaround until Apple addresses the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p3vO"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJ350W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brave browser takes step toward enabling a decentralized web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54ASck_s2c9ZOXD4yBZYEA-8ios=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689158/acastro_200211_3900_Brave_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Pw9FC"&gt;Brave has just taken a step toward supporting a decentralized web by becoming the first browser to offer native integration with a peer-to-peer networking protocol that aims to fundamentally change how the internet works. The technology is called IPFS (which stands for InterPlanetary File System), a relatively obscure transport protocol that promises to improve on the dominant HTTP standard by making content faster to access and more resilient to failure and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUyeek"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/"&gt;explainer from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers a good overview of how the protocol works. But here’s the short version: while HTTP is designed for browsers to access information on central servers, IPFS accesses it on a network of distributed nodes. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/78xgaq/the-interplanetary-file-system-wants-to-create-a-permanent-web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; likens&lt;/a&gt; it to downloading content via BitTorrent, rather than from a central server. You type in a web address like normal, and the &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/#how"&gt;network is able to find the nodes&lt;/a&gt; storing the content you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kbeKCq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MSq0C"&gt;Benefits of the new approach include faster speeds because data can be distributed and stored closer to the people who are accessing it, as well as lower server costs for the original publisher of the content. But perhaps most importantly, IPFS has the potential to make web content much more resilient to failures and resistant to censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMJubD"&gt;Brave, which currently boasts 24 million monthly active users, has been an &lt;a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-08-ipfs-browsers-update/"&gt;early supporter of IPFS&lt;/a&gt;, working on the standard since 2018. But with &lt;a href="https://brave.com/download/"&gt;version 1.19&lt;/a&gt; of the Brave browser releasing today, Brave users will be able to access IPFS content directly by resolving URIs that start with ipfs://. They can also opt to install a “full IPFS node in one click,” making their browser a node in the peer-to-peer network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9YKDb"&gt;“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access,” Brave CTO Brian Bondy said in a statement, adding that this gives Brave users “the power to seamlessly serve content to millions of new users across the globe via a new and secure protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr4NlA"&gt;IPFS project lead Molly Mackinlay adds that IPFS’s enablement of the decentralized web can overcome “systemic data censorship” from governments and Big Tech. “Today, Web users across the world are unable to access restricted content, including, for example, parts of Wikipedia in Thailand, over 100,000 blocked websites in Turkey, and critical access to COVID-19 information in China,” says Mackinlay, “Now anyone with an internet connection can access this critical information through IPFS on the Brave browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGhVVz"&gt;This effort to make web content more resilient and unconstrained comes at a time when service and platform owners are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225238/trump-social-media-ban-platform-moderation-tech-regulation-daphne-keller-interview"&gt;facing tough choices&lt;/a&gt; about what content should remain online. Following the Capitol riot on January 6th, President Trump was silenced on both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the Parler app being pulled from both the Google and Apple app stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon withdrawing its centralized web services&lt;/a&gt;. A decentralized web enabled, in part, by IPFS would make that kind of control more difficult in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61FCVN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=02d0ad7c6f8a364fc5cf9c4fd7d37de4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi for $559&lt;/a&gt;, with all the colors available at a discounted price.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ec9f3ab0f5e7827303dfa0d2a8efa4c7&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model with Wi-Fi in Silver marked down to $759.05&lt;/a&gt; (with a coupon applied) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5de51a395ed06fc6671cc2868597f47a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration in both colors for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f9ea03b10d85b158021643fd4d952af6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,230&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $69 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All five seasons of The Muppet Show are heading to Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9TILAUfUncmPLVWlNQnHb7q6Wo=/0x81:1200x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68688972/TMS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GeVGEd"&gt;All five seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt; will stream on Disney Plus beginning February 19th, Disney announced today. With the addition, Disney Plus is now home to nearly every Muppets title — except two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wZ2gl"&gt;While Disney owns the rights to &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Muppets Most Wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppet Movie&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Muppet Treasure Island&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppet Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppets&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Great Muppet Caper&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all of which are streaming on Disney Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Muppets Take Manhattan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Muppets from Space &lt;/em&gt;are owned by Sony. As such, Disney can’t host the entire Muppet movie collection. Disney will also make the fourth and fifth seasons of the series, previously never available to purchase through home video offerings, available on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1mgut"&gt;It’s a similar situation to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892494/spider-man-homecoming-review-tom-holland-michael-keaton-robert-downey-jr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761022/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that Marvel Studios (and therefore Disney) co-produced the film with Sony, Sony owns the rights to the series. That’s why the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe collection isn’t available on Disney Plus. Licensing rights! The bane of every subscriber’s existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPXvPG"&gt;Fans of Jim Henson Company’s entire body of work are in even more of a pickle. While most of the Muppets works are on Disney Plus, the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;belongs to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. When the tech giant decided to reboot &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;, the company purchased the streaming rights to the entire series in order to have the full collection. That means anyone who wants to stream all of &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock &lt;/em&gt;or every single Muppets title needs to do it in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PXOdTh"&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="haS91x"&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-tv-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238672%2Fmuppet-show-disney-plus-seasons-streaming-movies-manhattan-space-sony#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cXil32"&gt;Purchase &lt;em&gt;Muppets from Space &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Muppets Take Manhattan &lt;/em&gt;through iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, or some other digital retailer. They’re currently $3 each on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Muppets-Space-Bill-Baretta/dp/B000W4CG60/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HyzeuN"&gt;This type of fracturing was always where subscribers, based in the United States especially, were headed. As more conglomerates launch streaming services to try to earn recurring revenue, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197141/netflix-leaving-2020-spiderverse-west-wing-dexter-wreck-it-ralph-office-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;more exclusivity plays&lt;/a&gt;. More exclusivity plays means there are likely more streamers to sign up for to watch every single movie or TV show in a franchise until all the licensing rights are bought back. Hopefully, eventually, Disney Plus will be home to every single Muppets title — the question is whether Disney wants to strike that licensing negotiation with Sony, and when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsNA79"&gt;If being able to watch any Muppets movie or TV show whenever possible means more to you than pulling up a site like JustWatch to see where something is streaming, just purchase them all. It’s a streaming-first world, but nothing beats ownership. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2hskn"&gt;iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/17/ifixit-shares-airpods-max-teardown-says-apples-headphones-are-hard-to-take-apart/"&gt;long in the making&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F139369%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max teardown&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFixit/status/1351530005931679744"&gt;finally complete&lt;/a&gt;, giving an exhaustive look at the internals of Apple’s debut over-ear headphones and an idea of how easy they are to repair. iFixit even went as far as to teardown Sony’s WH-1000XM4 and Bose’s NC 700 headphones for comparison. Until now, iFixit has refused to grant Apple a single repairability point for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BTeardown%2F75578&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2B2%2BTeardown%2F121471&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F127551&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the AirPods Max buck the trend with a surprisingly high score of six out of ten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXEbce"&gt;Why so high? Well, for starters, its ear cushions attach via magnets, making them easy to swap and replace when they inevitably get worn out. There are also plenty of internal components held together with screws rather than messy glue, which should make it easy for would-be repairers to swap them out if they break. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of what iFixit calls “perhaps the most elaborate part” of the headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rf6voIcfj3D0LX5RggbzqctNvq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244913/3TVFPEtOAWpAnyId.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, there’s some adhesive in the way of repairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9gBwei"&gt;iFixit is particularly fond of the headband hinge mechanism found between the band and the ear cups, which it notes can be detached “with just a SIM card removal tool or paperclip, without even opening the ear cup.” It calls this “perhaps the most elaborate part of the AirPods Max” and notes that it’s “both intricate and overbuilt, and might make the AirPods Max’s price tag a little easier to swallow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyiar3"&gt;The design is also pretty neat: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KcMd5e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty cool &lt;a href="https://t.co/C0cfQyZ72k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C0cfQyZ72k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—        (@takwan_t) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/takwan_t/status/1351579099714752512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwmtic"&gt;The headphones aren’t perfectly repairable by any means. Opening the AirPods Max involves dealing with some messy adhesive, and while Apple has done a good job at using screws to hold together their internal components, iFixit points out that it uses a bewilderingly different array for the job, meaning you’ll have to be well equipped with screwdriver heads to attempt a repair. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/759wZH7hKv9rqBk7UBOM5V9hpJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244999/JL5Aa6mhL1UGa5pS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max (center) versus headphones from Sony (left) and Bose (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bTXJkS"&gt;Compared to other popular over-ear headphones, however, the AirPods Max fair well. As part of its deep dive into Apple’s headphones, iFixit also tore down the cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose NC 700&lt;/a&gt;, which are among our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;favorite noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. But it notes that compared to the “obsessive craftsmanship” of Apple’s headphones, they end up looking “like toys by comparison.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG1Kk1"&gt;Considering their eye-watering $550 price tag, it’s reassuring to see that the AirPods Max won’t be a complete nightmare to repair when their batteries and other components start failing in a couple of year’s time. Now, Apple just needs to find a way to bring this same repairability to its &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/true-wireless-hearables-market-beats-expectations-2019-apple-continue-dominating-2020/"&gt;ludicrously popular&lt;/a&gt; true wireless AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
