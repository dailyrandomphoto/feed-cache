    <title>New World is getting exclusive Wheel of Time gear through Twitch drops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzNVFF3GeUOXyA2kHsNtAmaC_Y4=/0x268:1080x988/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297604/WOT___NW_Items.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6QgWV"&gt;Amazon has announced that it’ll be adding exclusive items to Amazon Games’ popular MMORPG &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; from Amazon Prime Video’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;TV series, which fans can obtain by &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/twitch-drops"&gt;watching special streams&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon’s Twitch streaming service, in a breathtaking example of cross-company synergy for Amazon’s various properties and titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMJfRx"&gt;The eligible “drops enabled” streams will kick off on December 24th at 12AM ET and will include watch-along parties for &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Times&lt;/em&gt;’s first season finale hosted on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; promotion is set to run through January 12th at 3AM ET and will require that fans watch a total of seven cumulative hours of eligible streams (or nearly as long as it would take to actually watch the eight-episode first season of the show) to earn all the various digital goodies in the drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDhbz6"&gt;In exchange, Amazon is doling out a variety of in-game items for &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; pulled from the &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; show, including Tam’s heron-marked blade, a barbed sword wielded by the villainous Trollocs, cloaks worn by the Red Ajah and Children of the Light organizations, and the outfits for Egwene and Nynaeve. Players will also be able to earn a crest with the &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time’s&lt;/em&gt; ouroboros logo on it to use for their in-game company, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EPA issues new rule to curb tailpipe pollution, fight climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Sues EPA Over Ruling Blocking State Emissions Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYh0O7HUUFbBD-9UGomhlTEBxHk=/0x1:3501x2335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297558/78713689.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Paul Morris/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOcLny"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule today aimed at reducing tailpipe pollution from cars and light-duty trucks — an effort by President Joe Biden to return to the fuel economy standards put in place by Barack Obama nearly a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ciEaP"&gt;Under the rule, passenger vehicles would be required to achieve an average of 55 miles of travel per gallon of gasoline (mpg) by 2026 — slightly over Obama’s goal of 54 mpg, but a major increase over the 38-mpg rule put in place by President Donald Trump. The EPA estimates the new standard would prevent the release of 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2050 and will save car owners $420 billion in fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBUutA"&gt;EPA Administrator Michael Regan called it “the most ambitious vehicle pollution standards for greenhouse gases ever established,” adding, “The standards are achievable, affordable, and will deliver a significant pollution reduction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mgYG3X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the most ambitious vehicle pollution standards for greenhouse gases ever established”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ii0k91"&gt;The new fuel economy standards are the latest effort by the Biden Administration to reduce air pollution in the broader fight against climate change. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824500/biden-executive-order-climate-change-carbon-emissions-electric-vehicles"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; directing the federal government to spend billions of dollars to purchase electric vehicles, upgrade federal buildings, and leverage the power of the government to shift to cleaner forms of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjtnui"&gt;The administration will need to rely more heavily on executive actions to fight climate change after Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) came out against Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which would have enacted a slate of environmental initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojbMgw"&gt;The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days, applies to vehicle model years 2023 to 2026. They’re seen as a return of Obama’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules from 2012 that required automakers to manufacture more efficient, less polluting vehicles. Those rules were rolled back under President Donald Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;who sought to weaken the rule&lt;/a&gt; and allow the auto industry to make dirtier cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3qiZjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days, applies to vehicle model years 2023 to 2026&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQ5d2T"&gt;Advocates applauded the new rule as a victory for the environment and public health. “Climate change impacts the health of every American — now and for every future generation,” American Lung Association National President and CEO Harold P. Wimmer said in a statement. “These greenhouse gas standards are a critical steppingstone to climate and clean air benefits that are desperately needed in communities throughout the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXw2bJ"&gt;The auto industry, meanwhile, signaled that more will need to be done to help spur increases in electric vehicle sales, including tax breaks such as those included in the Build Back Better plan that now looks uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6Ogbo"&gt;“Achieving the goals of this final rule will undoubtedly require enactment of supportive governmental policies,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies for the auto industry, “including consumer incentives, substantial infrastructure growth, fleet requirements, and support for U.S. manufacturing and supply chain development.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb tightens ‘anti-party’ rules for rentals as New Year’s Eve approaches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airbnb logo displayed on a smartphone " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfvjXQJFxCfEF3YTWZwXndpM-jg=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297544/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airbnb is cracking down on New Year’s Eve parties | Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3et0AT"&gt;Airbnb said Monday it’s tightening &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-plan-to-crack-down-on-new-years-eve-parties/"&gt;its policy&lt;/a&gt; restrictions on New Year’s Eve parties, adding “anti-party” restrictions to some three-night rentals for guests without a history of positive reviews on the platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gvh41"&gt;In the US, Canada, Brazil, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand, guests without a history of positive reviews on Airbnb’s platform can’t make one-night, two-night, and now three-night reservations for an entire house that “may pose heightened risks for unauthorized parties.” Airbnb said it would be focusing on local reservations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgAxfk"&gt;Guests on the platform who have a history of positive reviews from Airbnb hosts won’t be subject to the restrictions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G62zlJ"&gt;Airbnb &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948759/airbnb-brian-chesky-bans-party-houses-halloween-orinda-california-shooting"&gt;banned “party houses”&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 following a fatal shooting during a large Halloween party at a rental in California. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/47f1797489eb4ab3928cd56aacfbfcec"&gt;Five people died&lt;/a&gt; in the shooting, and local news reports said there were more than 100 people in the house at the time. In August 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377408/airbnb-global-ban-house-parties-coronavirus"&gt;said it was adding restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to adhere to local health departments’ social distancing requirements for large in-person gatherings, imposing an occupancy cap of 16 people. Hosts or guests on Airbnb who try to evade the rules could be subject to a ban from the platform or even possible legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rts7wR"&gt;During the early days of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F2839%2Fhealth-and-safety-requirements-for-airbnb-stays&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Airbnb put into place guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for hosts and guests, and its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F2701%2Fextenuating-circumstances-policy-and-the-coronavirus-covid19&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extenuating circumstances policy&lt;/a&gt; could be applied if a guest or host becomes infected. It’s updated those rules as pandemic conditions have warranted and added filters for guests to find listings with flexible cancellation policies. While the company hasn’t implemented any new policies amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19, spokesperson Ben Breit confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the guidelines from earlier in the pandemic would still apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ssWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzqAsQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze now shows EV charging stations on its driving map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzby3xsF3v-Yqia1UaKUYuaYL7s=/70x0:651x387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297462/waze_ev_charging_station_search.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Waze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TghYKB"&gt;Waze can finally help you locate and drive to nearby electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the US, letting you find EV pit stops just as easily as you would a gas station. You can also search for charging stations along your route, which should make it a bit less stressful to find a place to juice up your EV if Waze is your preferred navigation app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1AvH7zmNv1UewGh_40SS4qOfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115036/waze_ev_volkswagen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Waze&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BG8ziE"&gt;Waze is partnering with Volkswagen for the initiative. As part of the campaign, you can switch your car icon within the app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;Volkswagen’s all-electric ID 4 SUV&lt;/a&gt; (in case you’re tired of polluting the virtual air in your cartoon smiley face on wheels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTiR6Y"&gt;This may give the Google-owned navigation app the boost it needs to catch up with its more mainstream counterpart, Google Maps, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17983986/google-maps-electric-car-charging-tesla-superchargers"&gt;displaying EV charging stations since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Google Maps also lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21023979/google-maps-ev-charger-plug-chademo-ccs-tesla-search-filter"&gt;filter the stations by EV charger plug types&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512330/ev-charger-google-maps-real-time-charging-status-electric-car"&gt;shows you which stations are currently in use&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252261/google-maps-electric-vehicle-charging-station-ai"&gt;uses AI to help you plan trips&lt;/a&gt; with your EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36aVlE"&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299325/apple-ios14-maps-updates-cycling-directions-electric-charging-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple Maps introduced a feature in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt; that lets you plan your route around EV charging stations. If your vehicle is compatible with the app, Apple Maps can even track your charge and automatically add compatible charging stations to your route if your charge gets too low.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford Mustang Mach-E joins New York City’s yellow taxi fleet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fMy_D8p3IBeiJnyeuvfRNhYx-0=/0x0:1260x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297160/RearMidtown.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5idw25"&gt;The Ford Mustang Mach-E is hitting the streets of New York City as the latest electric vehicle to join the ranks of the city’s iconic yellow taxi fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOWlft"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E, with its fresh coat of Rally Yellow paint and classic taxi iconography, is being operated by Gravity, a startup focused on EV fleets and charging infrastructure. This is the first time that Ford’s new, mass-market EV is being deployed as a taxi. But it won’t be the last — Gravity says it hopes to eventually operate a fleet of 50 electric vehicles comprised of both Mustang Mach-Es and Tesla Model Ys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQaK86"&gt;“I think the Mustang and the Model Y are kind of like the ideal taxi vehicles that are available today,” Moshe Cohen, founder and CEO of Gravity, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Eid0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the Mustang and the Model Y are kind of like the ideal taxi vehicles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M1uRan"&gt;Gravity isn’t the first company to deploy EVs as taxis. Back in 2019, the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission approved the Tesla Model 3 as the first EV eligible to become a yellow taxi. A year later, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/06/first-tesla-model-3-official-nyc-yellow-cab/"&gt;the first Model 3 was spotted in the city&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; alum &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShGyRzsETw8"&gt;Sam Sheffer took a ride&lt;/a&gt; late last year.) And earlier this year, moped sharing company Revel announced a plan to launch 50 Tesla Model Ys as a for-hire vehicle fleet in Manhattan — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla"&gt;though the city later blocked that plan&lt;/a&gt;. (The company &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/revel-to-launch-tesla-taxis-in-nyc-after-row-with-city-regulators/"&gt;eventually won&lt;/a&gt; approval.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGSQIZ-fm9X0Le8PTQ0t-jNNlA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114878/SideviewBB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppOtrg"&gt;Gravity is going a different route by integrating its vehicles into the city’s regulated fleet of yellow cabs. The vehicles are authorized for use as taxis under an EV pilot program adopted by the TLC earlier this year. But to do so, Gravity will need to lease a taxi medallion, which is a permit issued by the city to allow people to own and operate cabs. The company is certified as a taxi agent, meaning it’s authorized to lease medallions. The Mustang Mach-E has gone through TLC approvals and inspections, but Cohen said there will likely be additional features to roll out that will require future approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAdmoP"&gt;Cohen said that Gravity has installed an “artificial intelligence camera” that tracks the driver’s face to prevent distraction. The company is also tracking the vehicle’s speed and other driving maneuvers to ensure drivers are operating safely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KUSUb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cohen said that Gravity has installed an “artificial intelligence camera” that tracks the driver’s face to prevent distraction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2ryad"&gt;EV charging infrastructure can be hard to find in New York City, but Gravity operates its own charging station out of a parking garage in Midtown Manhattan. The company plans on installing more chargers in the future, Cohen said, including fast-chargers capable of speeds of up to 350 kW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SFghh"&gt;In the US, more taxi operators are integrating EVs into their fleet, encouraged by the cost savings and marketing potential. Rental car companies are also getting in on the action, with Hertz recently placing a 100,000-car order with Tesla. (The news of the order sent shares in both companies soaring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;pushing Tesla’s valuation over $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disabled passengers were promised autonomous vehicles — they’re still waiting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7UrmRXGbb6_cnd8nz76MsHGiDM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296965/acastro211213_4881_0001.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It turns out that designing autonomous vehicles for disabled passengers is an immense challenge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="43AJ3L"&gt;For years, people with disabilities have been promised that autonomous vehicles are right around the corner. Self-driving cars will open up new possibilities for people with vision, hearing, and mobility impairments. Help was on the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8c43J"&gt;But Haben Girma is tired of waiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y1JTD"&gt;“People with disabilities stand to benefit the most from self-driving cars, but developers are not making accessibility enough of a priority,” said &lt;a href="https://habengirma.com/"&gt;the author and deafblind disability justice lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. “Waiting until a product is ‘finished’ to start thinking about accessibility is like completing construction of a skyscraper and then tearing part of it down to install an elevator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nWUzZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People with disabilities stand to benefit the most from self-driving cars, but developers are not making accessibility enough of a priority”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SedtNT"&gt;Over 25 million Americans have disabilities that make traveling outside the home difficult. Historically, car companies have provided little relief, producing vehicles that are either inaccessible or cost thousands of dollars to retrofit for a driver with disabilities. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) present a tantalizing solution to millions of frustrated people. But the industry’s well-publicized struggles, as well as the broken promises of tech companies in the past, are forcing many in the disabled community to wonder whether AVs are the salvation they’ve been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0LlNS"&gt;The skepticism among the disabled toward tech companies is warranted. Uber and Lyft initially claimed that their ride-hail fleets would be a boon for disabled customers, but wheelchair-accessible vehicles are largely absent from both companies’ platforms. And over the past decade, the ride-hailing industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774771/uber-disabled-discrimination-lawsuit-justice-department"&gt;routinely resisted efforts by regulators&lt;/a&gt; to force them to deploy more accessible vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAy9B0"&gt;Whether it is a broken foot, an unforeseen traumatic event, or just getting old — we are all likely to have a disability at some point. Currently, a disabled individual might not have the means to modify a vehicle, they may not be able to drive, or it may be too difficult to navigate public buses and trains. The more accessible AVs are from the beginning, the more everyone will benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6esqX"&gt;One of the biggest automakers in the world, Volkswagen, is already taking steps to ensure its AVs are designed to serve a broad range of people. By talking to groups like the American Association of People with Disabilities, Volkswagen said it is well aware of the engineering challenges they face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u1FsnS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more accessible AVs are from the beginning, the more everyone will benefit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieYSDf"&gt;The automaker’s Inclusive Mobility team, based in Santa Clara, California, is working on how an autonomous vehicle could communicate on multiple levels with users who are d/Deaf or have low vision. The team is working on a software interface with an accessible screen reader and on interior concepts with visual, text, and tactile notifications for d/Deaf passengers, as well as external vehicle speakers and microphones, to support locating and boarding for those with low vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZkjxe"&gt;VW isn’t alone in thinking about how its AVs should be designed to serve the disabled community. Toyota, Cruise, and Waymo are also working on solutions for how to transport riders with different bodies and accessibility needs. And they find themselves encountering the same design hurdles as the VW team. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YIg6EP"&gt;Besides making its AV software accessible, VW is also examining seating concepts like seats facing each other for better face-to-face communication among d/Deaf passengers. This would also help passengers read the lips of someone with a speech impairment that might be difficult to understand. But it’s also a seating arrangement that may cause motion sickness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGhbjf"&gt;“Having empathy for the challenges faced by disabled communities in mobility is only the starting point,” said Chandrika Jayant, UX researcher and design manager at Volkswagen Group of America. “We need to understand the specific needs. We need to be involved in continuous dialogue with the people who are underserved to hear from them their experiences and not simply imagine what those experiences might be. It’s a complex process that demands that we have a deep understanding... and that our ideas are future-proofed to some degree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNBCQb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we need to be involved in continuous dialogue with the people who are underserved to hear from them their experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhd0SR"&gt;One of the most complex challenges Jayant faces is the lack of industry-wide standards for how wheelchairs can be secured in a vehicle. Jayant says that this issue requires collaboration between wheelchair makers, insurance companies, users, and governments. Even with the design obstacles, Jayant remains enthusiastic: “[Inclusive design] is very exciting to work on,” she said. “This is really groundbreaking design research.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQrPFT"&gt;Christian Lorenz, senior director of intelligent cockpit and body at VW, points out a fact so obvious that it’s easy to forget: “It is important to consider that many policies drafted to assist disabled Americans were written long before anyone seriously dreamed that self-driving mobility could happen — and, quite often, even before computers were part of our everyday lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbs14U"&gt;Many of those policies came from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was signed into law 31 years ago. Lopez notes that insurers define wheelchair coverage as a necessity in the home, but the role of wheelchairs in AVs has never been on the radar. Precautions like crash safety and self-securement often get treated like beyond-the-scope upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZcGwE"&gt;Volkswagen isn’t the only automaker with a team working on AV accessibility. We Will Ride, a coalition of advocates dedicated to ensuring a future with accessible AVs, released its annual &lt;a href="https://www.aapd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-AAPD-Auto-Accessibility-Scorecard-Progress-Report-1.pdf"&gt;scorecard&lt;/a&gt; in July on the companies doing the best job of making their AVs disability-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1ZidE"&gt;Toyota, long a leader among automakers in robotics and technology, got high marks from the group. This includes the creation of a fifth R&amp;amp;D department solely for AV accessibility, a $1 million contract from the US Department of Transporation to help study the impact of AVs on people with disabilities, and a slew of disability-focused programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIBT2"&gt;Jade Hill, Toyota’s program manager of crash avoidance and advanced technologies, is an important voice in Toyota’s inclusivity push. The company has partnered with May Mobility out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to launch an accessible AV shuttle in Indianapolis. May Mobility also has accessible shuttle services in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Arlington, Texas, and Hiroshima, Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PE0Ad"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota pulled its AVs from the Tokyo Paralympics after hitting a visually impaired athlete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4VUiVj"&gt;But Toyota still has work to do to ensure its AVs are safe for riders as well as pedestrians. The company recently pulled its e-Palette AVs from the Tokyo Paralympics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644496/toyota-epalette-autonomous-shuttle-crash-halt-olympics"&gt;after hitting a visually impaired athlete&lt;/a&gt;. A day later, it reinstated the vehicles, saying that the accident occurred due to human error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xknetZ"&gt;Cruise, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, highlighted accessibility in its most recent investor call and offered renderings as proof. Cruise has also hired a full-time accessibility program manager who can boast that part of their fleet offers driverless rides to disabled individuals around San Francisco. Cruise built its AV, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3E7p4S_1m4"&gt;the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, with modularity in mind. From the low floor and high roof to the double-wide doors and removable seats, Cruise views the Origin as a blank canvas that it can modify with customer feedback. The Origin is scheduled for release in 2023 alongside an accessible variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNoqoJ"&gt;But the Origin is still years away from service, and Cruise is facing challenges around its lack of accessibility right now. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/san-francisco-agency-opposes-cruise-robotaxi-application-citing-safety-2021-12-01/"&gt;The company was recently accused&lt;/a&gt; by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority and several other government agencies of failing to offer service in low-income and minority areas or accommodate people using wheelchairs. The company defended itself by arguing that it was following the law. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="GM’s Cruise Reveals First Vehicle Made To Run Without Driver" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHIsqLhkpXwNEa2y8Li1-7UiHoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098699/1195279026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Cruise Origin is the company’s next-generation autonomous shuttle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M02KmZ"&gt;Zoox, a California-based company recently acquired by Amazon, has engaged with major disability advocacy groups. Zoox has Braille on its vehicles’ internal emergency button, innovative uses of light and sound to communicate with riders and road users, and large visual displays inside the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzGVsN"&gt;AV operators aren’t only thinking about the people who use their vehicles. A major concern among disabled people is getting hit by a car, and people like Anne Marie Lewis, AV safety regulatory lead at Argo, are making sure those accidents never happen. Argo, which is backed by Ford and VW, believes that &lt;a href="https://groundtruthautonomy.com/the-secret-to-scaling-self-driving-technology-testing-in-multiple-cities/"&gt;geographical diversity&lt;/a&gt; will prepare its technology for complex scenarios. The company’s 3D maps are so detailed that Argo not only knows the locations of avenues but also where crosswalks are, abandoned signs, and even local regulations and the differences in pedestrian behavior depending on the city. And the maps will continue to stay current and detailed the more its software is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCpJ6o"&gt;One of the problems faced by disabled people is an AI that identifies different body types and shapes. Argo has answers for that, too: “This [diverse] learning includes training our perception system with a wide array of people and their movement, including those using wheelchairs, so that we’re able to identify, classify, track and predict their behavior,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If the self-driving system observes a three-headed monster (on Halloween, for example), it may not know what it is, but the perception system can still report that it sees an unknown object at a particular position and moving at a particular speed in a particular direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vrMgSU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the problems faced by disabled people is an AI that identifies different body types and shapes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOYFfL"&gt;Waymo released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2910196/google-self-driving-car-video"&gt;video nearly a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; of one of its cars ferrying a man that lost 95 percent of his sight. The company followed that up with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArYTxDZzQOM&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;2015 video&lt;/a&gt; of the same man by himself in a Waymo AV — before many inclusive teams even started. The company’s ride-hailing service has conducted driverless rides since October 2020 in Phoenix, Arizona, including those with different accessibility needs. However, the company does not keep track of how many disabled riders it has served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf55io"&gt;With all that feedback, as well as help from Google’s accessibility team, Waymo has created an app that follows WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), supporting screen readers and high contrast modes. The app can minimize your walking time to your ride, remotely honk the vehicle’s horn for low vision riders, and there is an option to choose what side of the street you get picked up on for those with mobility issues. While in the car, low vision riders can listen to detailed audio of key events on their trip. And through the DOT’s Inclusive Design Challenge, Waymo plans to integrate more inclusive features to its app, like haptic cues to navigate to your ride, headlight flashes to locate a vehicle, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TczgN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo plans to integrate more inclusive features to its app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0DVII"&gt;In late August, Waymo opened its ride-sharing service to “Trusted Testers” in San Francisco. Compared to the flat, open, and dry terrain of Arizona, the rides through the hilly, foggy, claustrophobic streets of San Francisco are sure to test the limits of Waymo’s technology. Waymo specifically stated that the Trusted Tester program is a “research-focused” effort with an aim to gather information related to accessibility. Those observations have caveats, though, because Waymo’s fleet consists of Jaguar I-Paces, which are not wheelchair-accessible. A spokesman says the company is working with a partner to provide WAVs to the Trusted Testers and plan to expand as they add riders.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTgh8Q"&gt;A 2017 report from the &lt;a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf"&gt;Rudderman Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an institution focusing on disability issues, concluded that autonomous cars could open up job opportunities for 2 million disabled people. The report also insisted that $19 billion would be saved on health care costs because disabled people would have dependable access to medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV7ikQ"&gt;Rory Cooper, a Paralympian in 1988 who has written three books and has 25 patents to his name, is the director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering and Research Lab and is renowned in the disability community. Right now, he is an advisor for autonomous vehicle company Merlin Mobility and is also leading a study by the University Transportation Center to advise and learn from various AV companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD8su3"&gt;For those reasons, Cooper doesn’t share the impatience expressed by disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and others in the disabled community. He thinks the future for disabled people looks brighter with more autonomous technology on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PK5xy3"&gt;“There is still much to be learned and to be done,” he said, “but at least the process seems to have started to move in an inclusive and accessible direction, which is extremely important as transportation is both life-sustaining and enabling for people with disabilities.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini is $20 off today at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtUMK7ahZKQSZS71DLjRnha1M7A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296851/jtuohy_211102_4860_0024_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9Nnw2"&gt;Apple’s short, stout HomePod Mini usually costs $99.99, but Best Buy is offering a $20 discount today on the smart speaker. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfi5O0cHlY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is the retailer’s lowest price yet, in addition to one of the best deals we’ve seen for it. If you’re in Apple’s ecosystem of products, there aren’t many other choices for buying a smart speaker that’s fully compatible with the Siri voice assistant, or HomeKit, for commanding certain smart home tech via the speaker. Still, it’s a great speaker that offers good sound quality for its size, and unlike the discontinued HomePod, this one’s compact enough to fit almost anywhere near a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqN51s"&gt;This deal is available on most of Apple’s vibrant colorways for the HomePod Mini, including blue, white, and black, but excluding yellow and orange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GGYkZU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGtJac"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable, lightweight (just 66 grams), and fully featured wireless gaming mouse, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfjmZTFOCP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s $59.99 deal&lt;/a&gt; on the SteelSeries Aerox 3 mouse is tough to beat. This mouse usually costs $99.99 (you’ll see the price drop when you’re signed in with your free My Best Buy account), and it’s available in black or white. This model supports 2.4GHz wireless via its USB-C wireless receiver or Bluetooth and can last up to 200 hours on a charge. Not for nothing, this mouse has an IP54 rating, giving it a fighting chance of survival against water and lots of dust. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more coverage here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QLpCkf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pg4qAc"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SRYXMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfjuEFMfnS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the Beats Studio Buds are back down to their lowest price of $99.99, matching the Black Friday deal. These normally cost $149.99, and they’re an especially appealing deal today if you want noise-canceling earbuds that are comfy to wear, with Android support and USB-C charging, to boot. Per our review, $100 seems like a good price to pay considering the perks and cons of the Studio Buds. You’ll get good sound quality, but their noise cancellation and mic performance likely won’t impress you all that much. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fsDp6g"&gt;Were you one of the people who picked up a digital copy of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; as a PS Plus perk several months ago? You may remember, then, that Square Enix wouldn’t allow those free copies to be upgraded to the faster, prettier PS5 version of the game. Well, ’tis the season of giving, and starting Wednesday, December 22nd, you’ll be able to upgrade your digital PS4 copy to the PS5 version for no extra cost. This is great if you purchased a PS5 since the game was handed out back in March 2021. Stay tuned for details on exactly how to run through the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgoR8p"&gt;Also on December 22nd, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;’s Yuffie DLC will be 25 percent off, letting you pick up the expansion at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is pictured here, but the Gram 16 looks identical, just a smidge smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nuB0KU"&gt;If you’re a Costco member, you can get a stellar deal on LG’s Gram 16 laptop (model 16T90P) that has a 16-inch IPS display, a capable Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor, a touchscreen, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It costs $1,746.99 at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-gram-16-2-in-1-touchscreen-intel-evo-platform-laptop---11th-gen-intel-core-i7-1165g7---wqxga---2560-x-1600-display---windows-11.product.100794354.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but Costco members can get it for just $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. This deal was picked up by &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15514858-lg-gram-16-2-in-1-touchscreen-intel-evo-platform-laptop-11th-gen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-wqxga-2560-x-1600-display-windows-11-1199-99?src=popular_recombee" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this deal isn’t available for non-members, like some of Costco’s products are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrxIJM"&gt;I reviewed the LG Gram 17 for 2021, and it’s essentially a must-buy laptop if you want a big but lightweight and quiet Windows machine and surprisingly long-lasting battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taco Bell had beef with Beyond Meat’s fake carne asada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Taco Bell Struggles With Ingredients Shortage Due To Supply Transport Issues" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d8Y8jxPMTW2awMwnx0zT9qcX3NM=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252679/1329911498.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2hUjQZ"&gt;Taco Bell, the restaurant known for having ground beef that's utterly indescribable, reportedly told Beyond Meat that its version of carne asada wasn’t good enough to serve. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/taco-bell-abandoned-plan-to-test-beyond-meat-s-carne-asada?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chain canceled a test product that featured Beyond’s plant-based steak after samples failed to live up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiMfHU"&gt;Beyond Meat denies the report — Shira Zackai, head of communications at the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “the test between Beyond Meat and Taco Bell was not canceled. Our partnership is strong, and we are actively working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely new to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space. We look forward to sharing more details on what Beyond Meat and Taco Bell have planned in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx3q8s"&gt;The report doesn’t make it clear what the company wasn’t fond of — was it the texture? The taste? Was it just too high-end for Taco Bell, seeming more like something you’d find at a Chipotle rather than the restaurant known as the place you drunkenly get 2 AM takeout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;? Whatever the case, people on Twitter have been having an absolute field day with the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That's a bummer but also wouldn't be that big of a deal if they actually subbed out the meat for black beans with 100% accuracy when I ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My good Taco Bell is at about 85% and my bad one is at about 50%. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ"&gt;https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ring My Bell (@RingMyBellPod) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RingMyBellPod/status/1469067305300598787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cShyL2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the two companies are still planning on working together to add plant-based meat to the menu, promising that it’d be something “entirely new.” Taco Bell is also testing out its own plant-based protein similar to its ground beef at some restaurants, &lt;a href="https://thebeet.com/taco-bell-is-testing-vegan-meat-at-nearly-100-us-locations/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Beet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/review-taco-bell-new-plant-based-meat-cravetarian-2021-4"&gt;one writer from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described it as “very disappointing”) . Beyond Meat did, however, reportedly let go of two employees who worked on the carne asada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0OQRX"&gt;A few other restaurants are currently trialing Beyond Meat products — the most notable is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728805/mcdonalds-mcplant-beyond-meat-burger-test"&gt;the McPlant from McDonalds&lt;/a&gt;, but Panda Express and KFC are also working on chicken-like products with Beyond as well. While some may read Taco Bell’s trial cancelation as bad news for vegetarians, the chain already sells the perfect meatless fast-food dish: the spicy potato taco, which makes up a far larger percentage of my diet than I’d care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhcnH1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 20th, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Beyond Meat denying &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;em&gt;’s report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren and Reps. Bush and AOC demand answers from Amazon after warehouse deaths</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roof Collapse At Amazon Facility Following Deadly Tornadoes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8EjehmIZruleslw5UorqUqA3l7s=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296648/1237190049.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois was struck by a tornado&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9HN3w"&gt;A group of progressive Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Reps. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is demanding answers from Amazon after six people were killed in a tornado strike at one of its warehouses in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRpyq"&gt;A letter sent Monday to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos says the events that happened on December 10th at the Edwardsville facility “fit a larger pattern: Amazon puts worker safety at risk in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dO9Ugc"&gt;“As we work to ensure that tragedies such as this one are not repeated, we seek answers about what happened at your Edwardsville warehouse,” the letter continues, “and whether your policies may have contributed to this tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3C2iO"&gt;The tornado was part of a complex of extreme weather centered in western Kentucky on December 10th, leaving at least 58 dead over more than 150 miles. The path of destruction included Amazon’s fulfillment center in Edwardsville, which was entirely destroyed by the strike. In the aftermath of the building collapse, reports emerged that workers at the warehouse didn’t receive proper safety training, and an overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"&gt;lack of preparedness by Amazon&lt;/a&gt; left workers in harm’s way, despite weather warnings that tornadoes were likely that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCrXQ8"&gt;Warren said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the circumstances in Edwardsville served as “another reminder that Amazon’s anti-worker and anti-union practices put their workers directly in harm’s way. Putting corporate profits above the health and safety of workers is unacceptable.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUndC"&gt;In addition to Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), the letter is also signed by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA) and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Jesus Garcia (D-IL), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Mondaire Jones (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jerry McNerny (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), Paul D. Tonko (D-NY), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), and Andy Levin (D-MI). It takes issue with a long list of problems at Amazon facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO2MG5"&gt;The letter includes a list of questions for Amazon to answer by January 3rd. In particular, the lawmakers ask who was working at the Edwardsville warehouse on December 10th and what safety policies Amazon had in place, as well as whether Amazon required workers at the plant to remain at work despite the tornado warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSxRvl"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841667/amazon-delivery-driver-illinois-tornado-warehouse-destruction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a nearby driver was instructed to continue deliveries just 90 minutes before the tornado strike, being told by their dispatcher that the storm sirens were “just a warning.” Amazon is investigating the incident and has said that the dispatcher “should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCk8hn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LbYNR6"&gt;The lawmakers also write they are “deeply concerned” about reports that Amazon plans to reinstate its mobile phone ban, which it paused in 2020 because of COVID. However, Amazon spokesperson Alisa Carroll told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week that the company had updated its cell phone policy. “All reporting that it’s been rolled back to pre-COVID is simply not true and factually incorrect,” Carroll said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBN8it"&gt;Two of the people killed in the Edwardsville warehouse collapse were constituents of Rep. Bush, who represents a district in St. Louis. She said in a statement that “Amazon’s profits should never come at the cost of our community’s lives, health, and safety. This cannot become the cost of doing business in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
