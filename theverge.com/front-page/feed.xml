    <title>You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THPKdKFi0ZYK8oI06_hzZbB1gy4=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016323/msedge_NvDwkwZyth.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bitcoin payment option appears underneath the typical “Order With Card” button.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Tesla.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4TDBLq"&gt;Tesla now accepts bitcoin as payment for its cars in the US, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105"&gt;CEO Elon Musk announced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. The option to pay using the cryptocurrency now appears on the company’s US website, where it’s available alongside the traditional card payment option. Musk said that the option to pay with bitcoin will be available to other countries “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJpkZd"&gt;As well as confirming the availability of the new payment option, Musk offered some details on how Tesla is handling the cryptocurrency. “Tesla is using only internal &amp;amp; open source software &amp;amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619379929772034"&gt;followup tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRcq0M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619672973221892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIMoMN"&gt;Tesla lays out how the bitcoin payment process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/bitcoin"&gt;works in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on its site, where it notes that users will have the option of scanning a QR code or copying and pasting its bitcoin wallet address to initiate the payment. It adds that trying to send any other form of cryptocurrency to its wallet means it “will not receive the transaction and it will likely result in a loss of funds for you.” According to Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/assets/pdf/btc_terms_and_conditions_en_US.pdf"&gt;bitcoin payment terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;, its cars will continue to be priced in US dollars, and customers who choose to will pay the equivalent value in bitcoin. Tesla estimates that a $100 deposit paid today equals 0.00183659 BTC, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuT8n"&gt;Tesla’s terms and conditions also caution that customers need to be careful when inputting both the bitcoin address and amount to be paid. It notes in all caps that “bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed” and “if you input the bitcoin address incorrectly, your bitcoin may be irretrievably lost or destroyed.” Customers are also responsible for directly paying all bitcoin transaction fees associated with their purchase, and Tesla warns that although bitcoin payments typically take less than an hour to complete, this can extend to up to “one day or more.” And because of bitcoin volatility, Tesla warns that the value of any refund made in bitcoin “might be significantly less” than the value of bitcoin relative to US dollars at the time of purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56b3b3"&gt;Tesla announced its intention to start accepting bitcoin as payment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;a little over a month ago&lt;/a&gt; in its annual 10-K report, when it said it would be adding the option in the “near future.” In the same filing, the company said it had also invested a total of $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. The news sent the price of bitcoin up to over $43,000, an all-time high at the time. As of this writing, 1 bitcoin is now worth a little over $56,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card doesn’t actually discriminate against women, investigators say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyajTf9Mg34jE82TN9RbZPYFaWc=/190x0:2227x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015404/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vH6eAT"&gt;Goldman Sachs’ credit card policies were called into question when Basecamp designer David Heinemeier Hansson and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak claimed that their female partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958953/apple-credit-card-gender-discrimination-algorithms-black-box-investigation"&gt;received lower Apple Card credit limits&lt;/a&gt; simply for being women. But a recently concluded New York State Department of Financial Services &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392556/rpt_202103_apple_card_investigation.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; has found Apple’s banking partner did not discriminate based on sex (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/goldman-didn-t-discriminate-with-apple-card-n-y-regulator-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1hOe2"&gt;NYSDFS investigators conducted a statistical analysis of almost 400,000 New York applicants that showed that the models and algorithms Goldman Sachs uses to filter applicants “did not consider prohibited characteristics of applicants and would not produce disparate impacts”. The regulator also stressed that the idea that spouses with shared finances would receive the same credit terms was a common misconception. Normal guidelines like credit history or unpaid debt were what determined whether or not a spouse received a higher limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zxrDDa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193330241478901760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ESgPe"&gt;For each cardholder that complained, the NYSDFS was also able to acquire specific justifications from Goldman Sachs for each decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EE5Szw"&gt;In each instance, the Bank was able to identify the factors that led to the credit decisions, such as credit score, indebtedness, income, credit utilization, missed payments, and other credit history elements. These decisions appeared to be consistent with the Bank’s credit policy, and none of the factors identified was an unlawful basis for a credit determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EBakWJ"&gt;Even without a case for sexual or marital discrimination, the NYSDFS was critical of Goldman Sachs’ response to its concerned customers. Technically, banks only have to disclose elements of their credit policy when they deny someone a line of credit, but the NYSDFS says that Goldman Sachs could have had a plan in place to deal with customer confusion and make it easier for them to appeal their credit limits. In the initial rush to launch the Apple Card, the bank had done neither. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikfFenLqMUTOEmShlBnyFzRdLUo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015226/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs at 720p). He also indicated that it could have a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueTznf"&gt;In other words, the device sounds like a big smartphone with attached controllers and active cooling, though that may not be a bad thing — the Switch kind of looks like a giant phone too. But it also has a library of great games that only it can play, which is its biggest draw. While there are plenty of good gaming experiences to be had on Android, from retro emulators to games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact, &lt;/em&gt;Qualcomm would have to give customers a reason why they should play those games on a separate device, rather than on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered gaming phones&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;built-in buttons&lt;/a&gt; or controller accessories (or on their regular phones).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with a controller accessory.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SD5rUT"&gt;Or at least, it will if it’s trying to sell the device to people — the &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; article indicates that Qualcomm does want it to be commercially available, potentially at carrier retail stores. It also says that the price target for the device is $300, the same as a full-sized Switch. Currently, the cheapest phone I found with Qualcomm’s flagship 888 processor, the Realme GT 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;costs roughly $430 (and is only sold in China).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0vi1Z"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821?s=20"&gt;Rahman notes&lt;/a&gt; that his source believed the product was closer to a reference design than something that would ever see store shelves. Chipmakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, often build sample devices to help other manufacturers design around their SOCs or radios. Sometimes, these reference products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;even end up being sold by other companies under different brands&lt;/a&gt;, known as whitelabeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AfvwLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s understandable why Qualcomm would be eying the handheld gaming market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2LZl"&gt;It is worth noting that the disagreement between the sources could be due to uncertainty from Qualcomm itself — &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;believes this project is almost a year from being finished, so the company may not yet know for sure what it wants this to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2F5l7"&gt;Whether the device ends up as a product or not (it could easily get canceled before it makes a public appearance), it seems like Qualcomm is actually designing and building a dedicated Android gaming device. It’s understandable why the company would be eying the handheld gaming market: it’s been heating up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia’s handheld Shield&lt;/a&gt; idea turned into the Nintendo Switch, with high-powered gaming phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Windows PCs with Switch-like form factors&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;classic handheld redesigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/1/18648304/playdate-hands-on-panic-keita-takahashi-bitsummit"&gt;novelty pocket gaming systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reveals flight zone for historic helicopter flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHLT1Es8ZtTdVAwgoOit2wXA2zM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014614/ExLz6_3UcA8hKZB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jae2db"&gt;NASA has locked in a location on Mars for the first demo flight of its mini helicopter named Ingenuity, engineers announced on Tuesday. The four-pound rotorcraft is gearing up to attempt the first powered flight on another planet, demonstrating a new capability that could unlock access to hard-to-reach areas of other celestial bodies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZxna8"&gt;Ingenuity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived on Mars&lt;/a&gt; in February, clinging to the belly of the Perseverance rover, surviving a seven-month trek through deep space and an intense seven-minute landing sequence through Mars’ atmosphere. Within a few hours of Perseverance’s landing, engineers started analyzing orbital imagery to find a prime flight zone to drop off Ingenuity for its first flight — “an area where it is safe for the helicopter to take off, and also safe for the helicopter to land again after flight,” the craft’s chief pilot, Håvard Grip, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfMljm"&gt;The landing site, he said, needed to be flat and free of any large rocks that could threaten Ingenuity’s flight demos. But it also needed to have “texture” — distinct features on the ground that the helicopter’s AI-powered navigation camera can spot to track its whereabouts during flight. Soon after landing, “we began to realize that we might just have a really great airfield right in front of our noses,” Grip told reporters at a press briefing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KipGjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first flight is special — it’s by far the most important flight we plan to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d33fl0"&gt;Perseverance is in the middle of a days-long drive to the flight zone, just 196 feet away from the landing site. When it arrives, the craft will be lowered to the ground. Then Perseverance will spend roughly 25 hours driving about 330 feet away to a location NASA named the Van Zyl Overlook as a tribute to &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/418/jakob-van-zyl-1957-2020/"&gt;Jakob Van Zyl&lt;/a&gt;, a senior Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist who died last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z9lpI"&gt;Dropping Ingenuity off in its flight zone is “a very prescribed and meticulous process,” said Farah Alibay, who leads Ingenuity’s integration with Perseverance. Ingenuity will need to be flipped from its current horizontal position on the rover to a vertical position before touching the ground, which will take “multiple days,” she said. “The most stressful day, at least for me, is gonna be that last day while we finally separate the helicopter and drop Ingenuity on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XPSO3ifiumfUyRTZYiWArJ0LPAk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392549/Mar_23_2021_16_55_33.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engineers test Ingenuity’s deployment from Perseverance using mock-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbH1Qt"&gt;Lockheed Martin designed the Mars Helicopter Delivery System that will help Ingenuity’s tiny landing legs set foot on the ground. Keeping that delivery system lightweight while secure was a huge challenge even for Lockheed, which has decades of experience designing space systems. “We had to toss all that heritage and knowledge aside and literally start from scratch with a new electrical connection design,” Jeremy Morrey, Lockheed’s top engineer for the deployment system, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWRDHL"&gt;Once on the ground, NASA engineers expect Ingenuity to conduct its first flight test no earlier than April 8th, give or take a few days depending on Mars’ weather. The helicopter’s flight zone is shaped like a mini running track, with a box-shaped takeoff and return area on one side of the zone. “The first flight is special — it’s by far the most important flight we plan to do,” Grip said, adding that a successful first flight will mean “complete mission success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrfDeF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345034/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter"&gt;For that debut flight&lt;/a&gt;, Ingenuity will climb nearly 10 feet (3 meters), hover in place for about 30 seconds, turn in midair, then descend for a landing. It will be fully autonomous, operating on commands sent by engineers back on Earth the day prior. A 0.5-megapixel navigation camera on Ingenuity’s underside will be snapping 30 photos per second of the ground to inform its movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtMkS"&gt;Ingenuity has another, more powerful camera with 13 megapixels facing the horizon. That will snap pictures in midair, while cameras aboard Perseverance will aim to capture the helicopter in flight. All of those pictures will eventually be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291412/nasa-perseverance-rover-first-images-landing-skycrane"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flight model of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="haNlBC"&gt;Four more flight tests are planned in a month-long window after Ingenuity’s first 10-foot takeoff. What the helicopter does during those flight tests will largely depend on the results of the first one. “It could, in principle, go higher currently as designed,” Grip said. “There may be cases where, if everything goes well during our nominal flights, we might stretch things a little bit beyond the nominal flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDje3r"&gt;After that, Ingenuity’s test campaign will likely come to an end. It’s a demo mission, and Perseverance has other objectives to focus on, like collecting Martian soil samples for a future Mars mission to bring back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hjvQc"&gt;If successful, Ingenuity will mark the first powered flight on another world. A mission to Venus by the Soviet Union in the 1980s under its Vega program claimed the title for first off-world flight, with two balloon aerobots (not powered) flying into the clouds of Venus. Off-world helicopters like Ingenuity, if proven to be viable, could be used in future missions to trek places where wheeled rovers can’t reach, like caves, tunnels, or mountaintops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG7HTz"&gt;Even before Ingenuity’s first flight, engineers are already celebrating making it this far. Having a tiny, four-pound helicopter survive a trip from Earth to Mars is no easy task, said Morrey, the Lockheed engineer. “You have to survive launch on a rocket while carrying a carbon fiber feather. It’s never been done before,” he said of a mission like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge3CAH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1omnx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbbYm9BW2d8T3Sci6WY-D-0rDNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014429/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHsQSA"&gt;Intel has a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and he’s not wasting any time to make some big changes. At the company’s “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjyEy6"&gt;The announcements are part of a new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel’s design and manufacturing, which is made up of three parts. First, there’s Intel’s in-house manufacturing, which will continue to serve as a key part of Intel’s design and production of chips. Second, there’s an expanded use of external foundries, including TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, for production of “products at the core of Intel’s computing offerings” for both consumer and enterprise chips, starting in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nFYd5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WabTaD"&gt;And third, there’s the newly announced Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel open its gates to handle manufacturing of chips for other commercial customers, led by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/randhir-thakur/"&gt;Randhir Thakur&lt;/a&gt;. Intel Foundry Services is a “standalone foundry business unit,” and it will develop x86, Arm, and RISC-V core chips for external clients using Intel’s manufacturing technology. And crucially for government work, Intel’s foundries will be located in the US and Europe, a benefit that competitors like TSMC don’t have. Partners include IBM, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn23vc"&gt;The expansion of Intel’s manufacturing efforts — which include a $20 billion investment into new fabs in Arizona that will expand Intel’s existing Ocotillo campus — come at a critical time: the ongoing global semiconductor shortage means that demand for chips is at an all-time high. Adding Intel’s foundries (and its new Foundry Services business) could help open up new avenues for companies to source the chips that are essential for everything from new video game consoles to new pickup trucks. Gelsinger also teased that more foundries are in the works, promising additional announcements of expansions in the US, Europe, and elsewhere in the world later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff7Vt3"&gt;Intel also announced a new R&amp;amp;D collaboration with IBM “focused on creating next–generation logic and packaging technologies.” Details are slim at the moment, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFI1NR"&gt;Lastly, Intel announced plans to bring back a spiritual successor to its Intel Developer Forum conference with a new Intel Innovation event planned for October in San Francisco this fall as part of a new Intel On series of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS24uV"&gt;Intel stands at a critical junction right now: the company faces increased competition from companies like AMD and Apple’s Arm-based M1 series of chips. At the same time, it’s seen major shifts in leadership and delays of generations of its chips, all while being outpaced by competitors like TSMC in terms of production techniques. Today’s announcements represent Gelsinger’s first big moves to try to right the ship. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon names former exec Adam Selipsky as the new head of AWS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_fKTgOIGhVdxJVmh4mdEozBjQQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014323/1183490734.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ACSqlm"&gt;Amazon has named Salesforce executive Adam Selipsky as the replacement for Andy Jassy, the longtime chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the company’s next CEO when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;founder Jeff Bezos steps down later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Selipsky worked at AWS for more than 10 years, raising to the rank of vice president of sales and marketing, before running the startup Tableau, which is now part of Salesforce. Selipsky’s hiring was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/amazon-taps-former-executive-adam-selipsky-to-run-aws.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which published a memo Jassy sent to Amazon employees on Wednesday announcing the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ra39a"&gt;“Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well,” Jassy wrote in the memo. Selipsky joined Salesforce when the cloud computing giant acquired Tableau in a monstrous $15.7 billion deal in 2019. Selipsky has been part of Salesforce’s executive leadership team since as Tableau’s acting CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gjMCAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="skUkn2"&gt;There was speculation as to whether Amazon would promote an existing AWS executive to take over Jassy’s role. Eyes were on Matt Garman, who was promoted to the top sales role last year, and Peter DeSantis, the general manager of AWS’s EC2 business, as potential candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqOguK"&gt;Ultimately, it looks like Jassy turned to a former colleague — and someone with a pretty stunning track record helping to push a midsized software company toward a $15 billion acquisition — as the top choice for his replacement to run AWS. Selipsky will rejoin Amazon in May, when he and Jassy will be “transitioning together” into their new roles in the lead-up to Bezos’ move to executive chairman of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJqZVZ"&gt;“With a $51B revenue run rate that’s growing 28% YoY (these were the Q4 2020 numbers we last publicly shared), it’s easy to forget that AWS is still in the very early stages of what’s possible,” Jassy wrote in the memo, referencing the less than 5 percent of global IT spend occurring in the cloud computing market. “We have a lot more to invent for customers, and we have a very strong leadership team and group of builders to go make it happen.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom now has an SDK for putting Zoom into other things</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits at a desk using a desktop computer. Emanating from the computer, connected with dotted lines, are a play icon, a picture of mountains, a map icon, and a weather icon." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAQSsaUFWUR8yRl_RJOaV3sX_tk=/192x0:1629x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014311/Video_SDK_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjiSEC"&gt;Zoom has released a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers build Zoom into their software. According to the company, you can now build your own “video-based applications and websites” on top of Zoom’s platform and can more easily incorporate Zoom’s video and audio features directly into your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxucl1"&gt;The company envisions developers utilizing Zoom’s chat functions in a number of different settings, from social media and gaming platforms to virtual retail apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8lnbH"&gt;“Using our Video SDK, developers can drive customer engagement and provide new opportunities for revenue without being tied to the Zoom Meetings user interface,” writes Zoom product marketing manager Natalie Mullin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/bring-industry-leading-video-to-your-application-with-zooms-video-sdk/"&gt;company blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw0h5J"&gt;The SDK is part of a broader push to get Zoom’s tools into developers’ hands. The company is also rolling out a &lt;a href="http://developers.zoom.us/"&gt;centralized portal&lt;/a&gt; where developers can learn about and access available developer tools. “We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development,” Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s a new analytics dashboard where developers can monitor how their users are interacting with the new Zoom features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNHCf1"&gt;Zoom has had to significantly scale up its operations since COVID-19 led to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"&gt;increase in remote work&lt;/a&gt; and remote learning early last year. The company says it added an “unprecedented number of free participants” in the first few months of the pandemic alone. It’s consistently added new tools to keep pace with competitors like Google Meet, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;expanded accessibility features&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273217/zoom-studio-special-effects-meeting-mustache-eyebrows-lips"&gt;facial effects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570302/zoom-security-temporarily-shut-down-suspend-meetings-stop-zoombombers"&gt;security improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will make you savor two of its reality shows with a weekly release schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDVhxAbTU8uxm-1_6IbLVDfCj5c=/222x0:1848x1084/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014156/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_1.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ei4fT0"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-circle-and-too-hot-to-handle-return-this-spring"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be experimenting with the release schedules of two reality TV shows, &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/circle-too-hot-to-handle-modified-release-netflix"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of releasing all of the episodes at once, it will release them over the course of a month, with each show having a batch of episodes released on Wednesdays, then releasing the finale by itself at the end of the run. This means you won’t be able to binge all of the episodes in a single weekend... and that may be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mW3XY"&gt;These shows aren’t the first time Netflix has broken away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453220/netflix-arrested-development-return-television-landscape"&gt;the binge model it popularized&lt;/a&gt;, in which all of the episodes of a show are released at once. It has released episodes of cooking competition &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;music contest &lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Flow &lt;/em&gt;on a weekly basis. With&lt;em&gt; The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, though, Netflix is making a statement that it’s experimenting and trying to give people time to “dissect and dish” the events of the show. In other words, it’s giving people time to gossip about what happened and what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXqKem"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaW6N"&gt;There is a benefit to having people talking about your show for a month, rather than only for a weekend. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039496/the-witchers-success-netflix-binge-watch-release-strategy-game-of-thrones-mandolorian-weekly"&gt;arguably ran into this problem with &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the show’s writing seeming better suited to weekly viewing rather than an eight-hour marathon. That’s especially true for a reality show like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor,&lt;/em&gt; with drama ratcheting up until a big finale. That’s the type of thing you’d want to keep people talking about — and maybe subscribing to your service to see what all the fuss is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brcW0L"&gt;That’s the type of effect Netflix could be trying to replicate. Reality TV lends itself especially well to a slow burn, keeping the internet buzz alive. Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;instead of all at once&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t become cultural touchstones like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;did, there is a chance the release schedule will let them become bigger than they would’ve if we had all watched them over a weekend and then moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AymYXB"&gt;I’m not trying to say that Netflix will (or should) switch to the weekly release model for its future narrative shows. Yes, Disney was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188654/mandalorian-episodes-finale-release-time-spoilers-game-of-thrones"&gt;very successful using that model with&lt;em&gt; The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but those shows also had a lot going for them, and Netflix has a history of successfully releasing narrative shows all at once: the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046412/netflix-witcher-henry-cavill-games-books-fandom-binge-ip-competitors"&gt;was still well-received&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;was an inescapable cultural force for a while there. It’s also worth noting that narrative shows and reality TV are very different formats, and it could make sense to have different release plans for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukvslx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Circle &lt;/em&gt;is a game show about being isolated in an apartment and using only social media to connect with others (weirdly prescient for a show &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(British_TV_series)"&gt;that first aired in 2018&lt;/a&gt;), and it will start showing on April 14th, with the finale releasing on May 5th. It seems like Netflix is planning a similar release schedule for &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, a show where people try to date each other without any PDA, but the company hasn’t released exact details about it yet, other than a release window of “June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTpTVt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow and Cruella are now coming to Disney Plus at the same time as theaters</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq0ULJXnu8tDEvk73OtVVISRQ3Q=/0x31:1096x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013349/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_2.40.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IbU69i"&gt;Disney is &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-media-and-entertainment-distribution-announces-updates-to-summer-film-release-schedule"&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; two of its biggest 2021 releases to streaming: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; are now set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed an additional two months: it’ll now debut in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 9th, instead of the previous May 7th release date. (&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; is still set to release on May 28th.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5106iu"&gt;Additionally, Disney announced further changes to its schedule: Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; will now be skipping theaters entirely (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;similar to last year’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and will release on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for all subscribers with no additional fee on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ft3OgF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Black Widow in theaters July 9 and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; with Premier Access. Additional fees required. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MSLHxk6Eez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MSLHxk6Eez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1374429041877389320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2LBlW"&gt;Alongside the new release plan for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, Disney also announced new theatrical dates for several other major 2021 films. Notably, Ryan Reynolds’ &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; will now hit theaters on August 13th, and &lt;em&gt;Kingsman&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man&lt;/em&gt; will hit on December 22nd. &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt; and Agatha Christie adaptation &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/em&gt;have been pushed to 2022, hitting theaters on January 14th and February 11th, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMJo4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s delay is a particularly notable one. Originally slated to hit theaters on May 1st, 2020, it has been delayed multiple times over the past year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic’s shuttering of cinemas. And while Disney has repeatedly said that it was still hoping to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; in theaters — with the potentially $1 billion-plus box office numbers that Marvel films tend to bring in — it seems the sluggish speed of reopening theaters has forced it to consider a simultaneous streaming debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSMGmh"&gt;And while the delay to July means that Disney will have a better shot at maximizing its box office returns (the film will still be released on the big screen for those willing to brave theaters), the interconnectedness of Marvel’s sprawling film — and now, streaming show — universe means the company can only delay new entries for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvkRu2"&gt;Each change means reshuffling the entire Marvel release schedule. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, &lt;/em&gt;for example, is set to hit theaters on September 3rd now that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has taken its July date. But there are also storytelling concerns: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is all but guaranteed to tie into the upcoming &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; show (which is planned for later in 2021), which means delaying the movie could also set back Disney’s streaming shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH9Dvv"&gt;The unprecedented move by Disney to shift such prominent releases to Disney Plus also emphasized how important the streaming service is to the company’s future. As CEO Bob Chapek commented when the service hit its 100 million subscriber milestone earlier this year, Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1ccHX"&gt;The decision to release &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — like &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; before them — will help give Disney a better idea of what premium home streaming will look like going forward. And while theaters will certainly be a big part of Disney’s future release plans, one only needs to look at things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ ongoing HBO Max release experiment&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;increasingly short length&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;theatrical windows&lt;/a&gt; to see how important streaming releases will be to the future of cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
