    <title>Elgato’s Facecam is a $200 webcam with streamer-friendly features </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RBo49i9O3G5ZujFDtA8C7AnAY8=/0x1:2594x1730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587297/facecamhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facecam includes a monitor mount, but you can also mount it to a tripod with its quarter-inch thread.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwM7nL"&gt;Elgato has attempted to be the brand of choice for streamers and content creators who need gear to get started — even if it’s rarely the most affordable option. It makes its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172438/elgato-key-light-display-streamers-youtube-ces-2019"&gt;LED lighting rig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20886205/elgato-multi-mount-extendable-rigging-system-twitch-youtube-streamers-creators"&gt;multiple kinds of mounts&lt;/a&gt; for lights and mics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;app-controlled adhesive light strips for your monitor or desk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22311223/elgato-light-strip-wifi-app-ios-android-sound-panels-stream-price"&gt;sound-dampening pads&lt;/a&gt; for podcasting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314075/elgato-green-screen-mousepad-mat"&gt;a mouse pad that doubles as a green screen&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot more. Now, it has a $199.99 webcam to sell you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpuC3M"&gt;The Elgato Facecam is a 1080p webcam that can record at up to 60 frames per second. It has a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, with an eight-element prime fixed focus lens with an f/2.4 aperture, 24mm full-frame equivalent focal length, and up to an 82-degree field of view. The company says it’s great for capturing detail while reducing noise in all sorts of lighting conditions, and the fixed focus is good if you don’t want a camera that’s constantly refocusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZ8hXs"&gt;The webcam is meant to be an option for people who don’t have a high-end camera of their own to connect to something like Elgato’s (pricey) Cam Link HDMI-to-USB devices, which range from $129.99 to $359.99. The Facecam includes a low-profile monitor mount and can attach to it or a standard tripod with its quarter-inch thread.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ag_S5iNMGhFplQdKW3s1OG71RbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706315/facecam2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monitor mount will encroach a bit on displays with very thin bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g6VrFX"&gt;An app called Camera Hub is available for Windows 10 and macOS, and in it, you can update the Facecam’s firmware and tweak the settings. This webcam has onboard storage that can save your specific white balance, contrast, zoom, and other settings, so it won’t need to be adjusted through the app again if you move to a different device. Elgato says the Facecam’s sensor is surrounded by a heatsink, which it says allows for “cool 24/7 operation” without overheating. Webcams &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;get a little toasty, so this will likely be a good feature to have if you run multi-hour streams, or if you’re someone gunning to overtake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22362532/ludwig-twitch-subathon-ends-stream-ninja-subs-record"&gt;Twitch marathon streamer Ludwig’s 31-day stream record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBin4k"&gt;What the Facecam offers might make it a good option for streamers who can afford its $200 price, or people like me who occasionally jump into a video meeting. I’ve been using a review model for the past week, and its auto-balancing features make me look presentable in my basement apartment dwelling — no small feat. I need to spend more time with it to really put it through the paces, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vq0H5cwVCmj-FYRr7VIW5EqQTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706318/facecam3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facecam connects via USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYXt8q"&gt;Despite the positive first impressions, it’s tough to ignore what the Facecam lacks compared to some similarly-priced competitors: the Facecam doesn’t have a microphone. Elgato omitted it because it figured most people have a preferred headset or dedicated microphone, which will almost definitely be the case for Elgato’s target audience. On the other hand, the Logitech StreamCam is a little cheaper at $170, has a microphone, and can also record at 1080p with 60 frames per second. It's smaller overall, and its Logitech Capture software can enable an auto-tracking feature that keeps you centered in the frame, which the Facecam currently doesn’t at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEbXmJ"&gt;Logitech isn’t the only competitor in this price range. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features"&gt;Razer’s $199.99 Kiyo Pro offers 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22553857/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-features-price-release-date"&gt;Dell’s new $199.99 UltraSharp webcam goes up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t have a built-in microphone either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzVANA"&gt;The Elgato Facecam is available today for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the Nintendo Switch OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/evcDNXAUvZ90QSh1sO3zM2YmJ8A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587172/oled_model_photo_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g91JCE"&gt;After months of speculation and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;sea of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the next iteration of its popular gaming console: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming device serves more as a midlife update than anything else, a refinement of the 2019 model as opposed to the more powerful “Switch Pro” that was rumored (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;may still launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKuikp"&gt;On sale for $350 starting October 8th, the aptly-titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt; is the next iteration of what has become one of the best-selling consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;over the last two years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s outfitted with a 7-inch 720p OLED display, a new dock with a wired Ethernet port, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that seems to take a cue directly from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers 64GB of built-in storage, up to nine hours of battery life — the same as the current Switch — and features “enhanced audio” for handheld or tabletop play. Sadly, despite persistent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors of 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model only supports 1080p resolution when docked. Apparently, Bluetooth support and an improved CPU will also have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6ASo1a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo confirms no new CPU or increased RAM in the OLED Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"},{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UyweAO"&gt;Still, the OLED model has plenty to get people excited, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;including our own Alex Cranz&lt;/a&gt;. It plays all the same games, supports the original Joy-Cons, and ships with a sleek black-and-white finish reminiscent of next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S. It will also be available with the red and blue Joy-Cons, if you prefer the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HnhAvm"&gt;Where to buy the Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L5vIbx"&gt;If you’re looking to get your hands on the OLED-equipped Switch at launch and get ahead of what might be yet another console shortage, you’re in luck. Right now, you can preorder the white iteration of the forthcoming console for $350 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fswitch%2F910582148" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746309011089526565" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-with-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, though the latter is only currently available to Pro members. Preorders began at 3 PM ET / 12 PM PT today, and will likely sell out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVVBUk"&gt;If you’re more of a traditionalist, you can also preorder the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-model-w-Neon-Red-Neon-Blue-Joy-Con%2F787152679" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red-and-blue model at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746309061747374347" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-with-blue-and-red-joy-con%2F11149259.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re a Pro member, though neither configuration is expected to ship until the Nintendo Switch OLED model officially goes on sale on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Anthony Bourdain documentary deepfakes his voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VLfYaxjkr4lkpwAoPssgK3aFK58=/0x0:5279x3519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587142/abpu_s11_newfoundalnd1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: CNN&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBWBLx"&gt;In a new documentary, &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner, &lt;/em&gt;about the life and tragic death of Anthony Bourdain, there are a few lines of dialogue in Bourdain’s voice that he might not have ever said out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNo5No"&gt;Filmmaker Morgan Neville used AI technology to digitally re-create Anthony Bourdain’s voice and have the software synthesize the audio of three quotes from the late chef and television host, Neville &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b80fjO"&gt;The deepfaked voice was discovered when the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s Helen Rosner asked how the filmmaker got a clip of Bourdain’s voice reading an email he had sent to a friend. Neville said he had contacted an AI company and supplied it with a dozen hours of Bourdain speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh72d1"&gt; “ ... and my life is sort of shit now. You are successful, and I am successful, and I’m wondering: Are you happy?” Bourdain wrote in an email, and an AI algorithm later narrated an approximation of his voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF5yc"&gt;You can hear the line in the documentary’s trailer linked below, right around the 1:30 mark. The algorithm’s generation of Bourdain’s voice is especially audible when it says, “and I am successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUPplf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=89&amp;amp;start=89" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0pRSR"&gt;Neville told Rosner that there were three lines of dialogue that he wanted Bourdain’s voice to orate, but he couldn’t find previous audio to string together or make it work otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8bJ8y"&gt;There’s no shortage of companies that can achieve this kind of AI voice replication, and there’s actually a burgeoning industry of companies that can specifically generate &lt;a href="https://replicastudios.com/"&gt;voices for video game characters&lt;/a&gt; or allow you to &lt;a href="https://www.descript.com/overdub?lyrebird=true"&gt;clone your own voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xDxOl"&gt;But whether it’s ethical to clone a dead person’s voice and have them say things they hadn’t gotten on tape when they were alive is another question, and one Neville doesn’t seem too concerned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rawzJQ"&gt;“We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later,” he told the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s new Steam Deck can run Windows and turn into a handheld Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jl_onTA11NfqBzd8mp_UptXfhbo=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586973/Steam_Deck_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s new Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVuudl"&gt;Valve just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;announced its new handheld Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a custom Linux operating system. The 7-inch device will play the latest AAA games, and because it’s a PC, you’ll even be able to install Windows on it. That means the Steam Deck could be the perfect Xbox portable, given Microsoft’s investment in shipping all of its future Xbox Game Studios titles on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GHHkR"&gt;“Steam Deck is a PC so you can install third-party software and operating systems,” says Valve, which means this hardware isn’t locked down in the way we’re used to seeing from tech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvCWgy"&gt;The Steam Deck itself will ship with SteamOS, a custom Linux operating system that loads into the familiar Steam interface you’re used to on PC. While Linux support for gaming has been improving in recent years, particularly thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;Valve’s Proton efforts&lt;/a&gt;, less than 15 percent of all games on Steam officially support Linux and SteamOS. That’s 7,586 games out of a possible 54,280 on Steam, compared to only 13 games on Steam that don’t work on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5CyR9C9Qm6UrHitttZ4oBzj9Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719886/Steam_Deck_touchscreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck ships with the Linux-based SteamOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JVJV3q"&gt;Installing Windows on the Steam Deck would open this device up to the thousands of games on Steam that aren’t listed as SteamOS compatible yet — you can check to see if the games you play are supported over on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;amp;tags=-1&amp;amp;category1=998&amp;amp;os=linux"&gt;Valve’s Steam site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgpFf2"&gt;When you look at the hardware inside the Steam Deck, it’s even closer to a portable Xbox than you’d expect. A custom AMD GPU will power the Steam Deck, complete with eight RDNA 2 CUs, and up to 1.6 teraflops of performance. That’s slightly more than the Xbox One S (1.4 teraflops), and slightly less than the PS4 (1.8 teraflops). It’s a modern RDNA 2 architecture, so it’s difficult to compare teraflops alone, but it certainly looks like it will be powerful enough for handheld PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O30SG"&gt;Obviously, the possible downsides to installing Windows will be whether there’s full driver support, and the struggles of a desktop UI that’s not optimized for a handheld device. It’s also not clear just how well games will perform on Windows on the Steam Deck, so there are a lot of unknowns until the device launches in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxQe11"&gt;That said, handheld gaming PCs are slowly emerging as viable alternatives to the giant rigs or hefty laptops you typically need to play PC games. A Switch-style &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22320306/aya-neo-handheld-gaming-pc-indiegogo-price-release-date-nintendo-switch"&gt;Neo Handheld launched&lt;/a&gt; on Indiegogo earlier this year, and the 5.5-inch &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console#/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22001420__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GPD Win 3&lt;/a&gt; is the latest in a series of GPD handhelds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6zMi2"&gt;We’ve been getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;close to a Switch-sized gaming PC for over a year&lt;/a&gt;, and Valve’s Steam Deck device is the first to really bring the idea to the mainstream. Now we just need to find out how well this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; runs games, and just how easy it is to get Windows up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black teen barred from skating rink by inaccurate facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrB7Vnydtt8xmRob_Kqa1NMLtwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586965/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ih1afT"&gt;A facial recognition algorithm used by a local roller skating rink in Detroit wouldn’t let teen Lamya Robinson onto the premises, and accused her of previously getting into a fight at the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgKXLE"&gt;But Robinson had never even been to the rink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIZ4A4"&gt;The facial recognition system had incorrectly matched her to another patron, she told &lt;a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/teen-kicked-out-of-skating-rink-after-facial-recognition-camera-misidentified-her"&gt;Fox 2 Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. The rink removed her from the building and put her outside alone, her family says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnf5zs"&gt;“To me, it’s basically racial profiling,” Juliea Robinson, her mother, told the TV station. “You’re just saying every young Black, brown girl with glasses fits the profile and that’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDJOOP"&gt;The harms of facial recognition systems deployed in businesses and by police have been slowly coming to light as the technology is more widely used. Research into these algorithms has shown that they are &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-is-face-recognition-surveillance-technology-racist/"&gt;far less accurate&lt;/a&gt; when distinguishing between the faces of Black people, women, and children, which might help explain the error faced by Lamya Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuuO1w"&gt;The highest-profile case of facial recognition leading to a wrongful arrest was also in Detroit, in the case of Robert Williams. Williams was arrested and detained for 30 hours in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"&gt;January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, after being accused of shoplifting from a Shinola watch store. He &lt;a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=4635"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; in front of the House Judiciary Committee, urging for legislators to adopt a moratorium on the technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303355/facial-recognition-ed-markey-ayanna-pressley-ban-federal-agencies-fed-law-enforcement"&gt;introduced as legislation&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQjTc3"&gt;“I don’t want anyone to walk away from my testimony thinking that if only the technology was made more accurate, its problems would be solved,” Williams said in his testimony. “Even if this technology does become accurate at the expense of people like me, I don’t want my daughters’ faces to be part of some government database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsi3FI"&gt;The disparity in racial and gender accuracy, as well as the invasive nature of the technology, has led to civil rights organizations and politicians calling for bans. The American Civil Liberties Union has called for nationwide bans and is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/michigan-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty-facial"&gt;suing the Detroit Police Department&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Williams for its misuse of the technology. Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;states like Maine&lt;/a&gt; have already begun to limit police use of the technology. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;only Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, currently has laws limiting how private businesses can use facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cgknwv"&gt;Civil rights nonprofit Fight for the Future announced that more than 35 other organizations had joined it in demanding that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576236/retail-stores-facial-recognition-civil-rights-organizations-ban"&gt;retailers stop using facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in their stores. The group reiterated its position today after the report of Lamya Robinson’s experience getting kicked out of the skating rink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgx3eW"&gt;“This is exactly why we think facial recognition should be banned in public places,” wrote Fight for the Future’s director of campaign and operations Caitlin Seeley George in a press release. “It’s also not hard to imagine what could have happened if police were called to the scene and how they might have acted on this false information.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the finalists to be included in Emoji 14.0 this September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rows of emojis including biting lip, a troll, coral, lotus flower, bird nests, beans, glass spilling water, slide, tire, ring buoy, hamsa, disco ball, low battery, crutch, X-ray, bubbles, ID card, and heavy equal sign." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVTMrl7gx2BJSH5qvr3CzNf7wos=/70x0:615x363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586504/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_12.52.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikbVom"&gt;The draft list for the next round of new emoji was &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, two days ahead of &lt;a href="https://worldemojiday.com"&gt;World Emoji Day&lt;/a&gt; on July 17th. Contenders include a melting smiley face, a low battery, a disco ball, and several new hand shapes — like heart hands and index finger pointing at viewer — for courting your sweeties or taunting your enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG8b2v"&gt;The release of new emoji was delayed this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214865/unicode-emoji-delay-2022-android-ios-mobile-release"&gt;because of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and proposal submissions were on pause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387628/new-emoji-submissions-unicode-subcommittee"&gt;until April&lt;/a&gt;. This list won’t be finalized by the Unicode Consortium until September, but in general, most candidates shown in the draft make it through. The final versions should roll out to different devices and platforms starting in late 2021 through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drafts of new emoji that will likely make their debut in Emoji 14.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uhl7GW"&gt;The new emoji show a continued expansion of race and gender inclusivity. The current lineup has customizable skin tones for the handshake emoji, a person with crown to hang out with the existing prince and princess emoji, and a pregnant man and pregnant person join the pregnant woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRL4Nf"&gt;I am personally very excited for the beans emoji, something I’ve longed for ever since I named my dog Bean a few years ago. I also plan to get a lot of mileage out of the X-ray emoji, because I can’t get enough emoji that have a little eeriness to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJpZnn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters contributed proposals for the saluting face and bubbles emoji. You can also thank him for the yawning face and waffle emoji that were introduced in 2019, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;read about that creative journey here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Go is available now for $299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OkDtMFY1fNY2D4v8pTblXqRiSkQ=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586416/01_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_silver_front_open.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5t2znu"&gt;Samsung’s new entry-level Chrome OS laptop, the $299 Galaxy Chromebook Go, is available to purchase now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/galaxy-chromebook-go-14---silver--wifi--xe340xda-ka1us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Samsung’s website&lt;/a&gt; and other retailers. While only the Wi-Fi model is available Thursday, Samsung plans to offer an LTE model in the coming weeks, which should be a nice extra perk for web browsing on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biXaV4"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go’s modest price seems to be reflected in its features. It’s got a 14-inch 1366 x 768 HD display, a definite step down from the 4K OLED panel that shipped on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305763/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-now-available-best-buy-price-specs-features"&gt;the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also working with an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and 4GB of RAM, which probably won’t set the world on fire, but should be enough for casual Chrome use.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3cnYOdbecnHSkqcVRz6uXKwwas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719584/13_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_sivler_dynamic1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go features USB-C ports and a USB-A 3.2 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxl6eZ"&gt;Samsung claims the Galaxy Chromebook Go’s 5480mAh battery should last 12 hours on a single charge, which in comparison to the Chromebook 2’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;around seven-hour battery life&lt;/a&gt; (in our tests) is great, but also is probably related to the differences in display and processors between the two models. Internal storage comes in at 32GB (expandable if you’ve got a microSD card handy) and the Chromebook Go includes one USB-A 3.2 port, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTkmGK"&gt;You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;our Chromebook guide&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in the market for a new lightweight laptop, but if Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Go speaks to you (and you’re not waiting for LTE), you can purchase it now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/galaxy-chromebook-go-14---silver--wifi--xe340xda-ka1us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from Samsung’s store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er7wj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s gaming handheld is called the Steam Deck and it’s shipping in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDGR1DAtGtjFDWRWvDOQwCVUOOo=/0x77:1831x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586299/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5OBXhG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453584/valve-portable-gaming-pc-switch-rumor-report"&gt;long-rumored&lt;/a&gt; Switch-like handheld gaming device. It will &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;begin shipping in December&lt;/a&gt; and reservations open July 16th at 1PM ET. It starts at $399, and you can buy it in $529 and $649 models as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOVBpo"&gt;The device has an AMD APU containing a quad-core Zen 2 CPU with eight threads and eight compute units’ worth of AMD RDNA 2 graphics, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There are three different storage tiers: 64GB eMMC storage for $399, 256GB NVMe SSD storage for $529, and 512GB of high-speed NVME SSD storage for $649, according to Valve. You can also expand the available storage using the high-speed microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HtEuJXjiJ2Q32S9JmW9o_eWDZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719726/Steam_Deck.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNcm9k"&gt;The Steam Deck has a huge number of control options. There are two thumbsticks, but also two small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;Steam Controller-style&lt;/a&gt; trackpads beneath the thumbsticks, which could give you more precision for things like first-person shooters. The front of the Steam Deck also has ABXY buttons, a D-pad, and a 7-inch 1280 x 800 touchscreen for 720p gameplay. The device also has a gyroscope for motion controls. Like the Switch, it has two shoulder triggers on each side, and there are four back buttons (two on each side) as well as built-in microphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPTxT8"&gt;Here’s a legend to all of the Deck’s ports and controls:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EusVpU4mQh_E3yd8IwSZ7b9vTck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719692/steam_deck_ports_controls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck’s external hardware features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6rEHc"&gt;As for the battery, “Steam Deck’s onboard 40 watt-hour battery provides several hours of play time for most games,” Valve says. “For lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing, you can expect to get the maximum battery life of approximately 7-8 hours.” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-faq-big-questions-answered"&gt;Valve tells &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “You can play &lt;em&gt;Portal 2 &lt;/em&gt;for four hours on this thing. If you limit it to 30 FPS, you’re going to be playing for 5-6 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ect1S"&gt;And if you need to pause your game, the Steam Deck offers a quick suspend / resume feature built into SteamOS that will let you put the device into sleep mode and pick up where you left off later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2A03I7gXXViF2X4eknuZ_0SpD-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719843/steam_deck_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vBIjbp"&gt;Valve will also sell a dock you can use to prop up a Steam Deck and plug it into external displays like a TV. You won’t need a dock to plug it into a TV, though — Valve says that the “Deck can be plugged in to your TV, monitor, or even your old CRT if you have the right cables.” The Deck comes with fully-fledged USB-C ports that contain HDMI, Ethernet and USB data, as well as standard Bluetooth. You’ll have native Bluetooth audio, something that’s missing from the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TFliW"&gt;On the software side of things, the Steam Deck runs what Valve is calling “a new version of SteamOS,” that it’s optimized for the handheld’s mobile form factor. But the actual OS is based on Linux, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)"&gt;will use Proton&lt;/a&gt; as a compatibility layer to allow Windows-based games to run without requiring that developers specifically port them for the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaLNiQ5p6O2eYAFo41flFzd2Eo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719673/Image_from_iOS__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the device showing off its four grip buttons, triggers, bumpers, vents and Switch-esque design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DRCPU4"&gt;Ultimately, though, the Steam Deck is still a full-fledged Linux computer, meaning that more technical users will be able to jump out to the regular Linux desktop, too. Valve notes that you’ll be able to plug in a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, and install other game stores, regular PC software, browse the web, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbrAYY"&gt;Valve says the Steam Deck’s features are designed to emulate the regular Steam app on desktop, complete with chat, notifications, cloud save support, and all of your library, collections, and favorites kept in sync. And if you want more power, you’ll be able to stream games to the Steam Deck directly from your gaming PC using Valve’s Remote Play feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STG26n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10653722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0ZQa"&gt;When reservations for all three versions &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;open on Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll initially be available only to accounts with purchases on Steam before June 2021, in a bid to keep reseller bots at bay. There’s also a refundable $5 reservation fee, and one reservation per person. Your reservation isn’t exactly a preorder, but it does put you in line to preorder the system once there’s inventory available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpvpfD"&gt;In December, the first units will be available in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with other areas following in 2022. The preorder invitations are supposed to go out before December, and if you miss your window on the invite, your reservation fee will be refunded to your Steam Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8zEOK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-hands-on-impressions-details-valve-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; got an early, exclusi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/valve-announces-the-steam-deck-a-400-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;ve hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the Steam Deck, which you can watch below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7poQo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLtiRGTZvGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RR57ox"&gt;IGN also got an interview with Valve’s Gabe Newell, who said that Valve designed the whole system with “very aggressive” pricing in mind, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical"&gt;calling it a “critical” and “painful” aspect&lt;/a&gt; of development. That’s a different strategy than Valve took with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, when it intentionally tried to push the industry forward with what was then the most expensive consumer-grade VR experience, at $999. Here, a $400 entry-level Steam Deck comes in just $50 more expensive than Nintendo’s new OLED-equipped Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date"&gt;which goes on preorder for $350 today&lt;/a&gt; and ships October 8th. (Valve swooped in on that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwDk4g"&gt;Valve’s Greg Coomer told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; that should the Steam Deck succeed, the company’s already thinking about future models, and offering the “building blocks” to other manufacturers as well. “We look at this as just a new category of device in the PC space,” he said. That might bring back echoes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;Valve’s failed Steam Machines initiative&lt;/a&gt;, in which it tried to encourage partners to build desirable Linux gaming desktops, but with key differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twn5xO"&gt;This time, Valve has created its own hardware first, it doesn’t need to sell every game developer on Linux ports, and this “category” of PC already exists to some degree: we’ve written about how Windows portables &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;have been edging closer to the dream of a Nintendo Switch-like gaming PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record high tide flooding hit coastal communities last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington’s Tidal Basins Sea Walls Crumble Due To Rising Sea Levels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuT46Kf9SaYmWGdRVW8WKJQrAqk=/0x121:5013x3463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586234/1159645477.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A walkway at the Tidal Basin leads to a flooded sidewalk from the rising high tide on July 2nd, 2019, in Washington, DC.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWWNR5"&gt;High tide flooding hit record levels in the US last year and is only expected to get worse, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/us-high-tide-flooding-breaks-records"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Coastal communities experienced twice as many days with high tide flooding last year than they did 20 years ago. Records were either matched or broken in 14 places across the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqTExA"&gt;Nationally, coastal communities were hit with a median of four days of high tide flooding in the past year — although some places suffered through more than quadruple that number. NOAA’s outlook for the rest of the year until April 2022 rises to three to seven days of flooding. But because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;sea-level rise&lt;/a&gt; tied to climate change, the long-term forecast is more alarming: 2030 could see seven to 15 days of flooding. And 2050 could bring on a whopping 25 to 75 days of high tide flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBwD2l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBsocG"&gt;That could harm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;roads, waste, and stormwater systems, NOAA warned. With high tide flooding becoming much more frequent, cities and neighborhoods will need to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiAcXO"&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind along the coast,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, director of NOAA’s National Ocean Service, on a press call yesterday. “These data that we provide help communities plan where to put their buildings and how to keep people safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Pd4P"&gt;High tide flooding, also called “nuisance” or “sunny-day” flooding, inundates streets and homes with water levels that reach up to two feet higher than the average high tide. While low and high tides are &lt;a href="https://scijinks.gov/tides/"&gt;caused by the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, this nuisance flooding is driven by additional factors.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As average global temperatures rise, oceans expand and push seawater even further ashore. The situation for coastal residents gets worse in places where land is subsiding or natural coastal barriers are eroding. Things will get even&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;trickier in the mid-2030s when a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/study-projects-a-surge-in-coastal-flooding-starting-in-2030s"&gt;regular wobble in the Moon’s orbit&lt;/a&gt; will combine with sea level rise to cause higher tides, a new analysis by NASA found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozDLWQ"&gt;Real estate valued at &lt;a href="https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/coastal-flood-risk"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; is vulnerable to coastal flooding — and we’re not just talking about summer beach homes. By 2050, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747466/rising-sea-levels-flood-affordable-housing-2050"&gt;affordable housing units&lt;/a&gt; vulnerable to flooding could triple as a result of climate change, according to one study published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNh6Py"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZupP0"&gt;Costly floods that in the past might have only posed a threat during a storm, might now be triggered by merely a change in prevailing winds or currents or even a full Moon, according to NOAA. The agency tracks 97 tide gauges across the US, and it looked at May 2020 to April 2021 for its new report. Eighty percent of the places where it collects data along the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coasts saw an uptick in flood days. (The West Coast was spared some flooding because of a La Nina last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr7I4C"&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift. People living along the western Gulf of Mexico saw 17 flood days last year — an astonishing 1,100 percent increase from what they experienced in 2000. Residents along the eastern Gulf had nine flood days, a 600 percent jump over the past two decades. The Southeast Atlantic coast got eight flood days, a 400 percent rise from 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bIihf"&gt;“We’re seeing a dramatic change in just two decades, and the conditions are changing not just in a few locations,” LeBoeuf said. This change isn’t confined to the US.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Coastlines around the planet are at risk for more frequent and extreme flooding. The frequency of severe flooding in the tropics, for instance, could get 25 times worse by 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/18/15658342/flooding-sea-level-rice-melting-ice-climate-change-extreme"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet is getting a wider rollout on Google Glass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman using Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrQlxf2lOO9fALSFBiJQL7Mo1V0=/85x0:1023x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586218/header_2880x1200.max_1500x1500.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;googleglass,glassenterprise,google glass enterprise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPLxEh"&gt;Google Meet videoconferencing is adding fuller support for Google Glass, the company’s frequently overlooked augmented reality headset. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/open-beta-now-available-to-all-workspace-customers"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; an open beta of “Meet on Glass” for the Glass Enterprise Edition 2. Users with Google Workspace can sign up to test the service following &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/google-meet/introducing-google-meet-for-glass-enterprise-edition-2"&gt;a closed beta&lt;/a&gt; announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyfoVW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516402/google-glass-meet-beta-enterprise-edition-remote-work-skype-microsoft-hololens"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/a&gt; laid out last year, Meet on Glass works differently from normal online videoconferencing. When a Google Glass wearer connects, other participants get a first-person view from the headset camera. Google pitches it as a collaborative remote troubleshooting tool for the business-focused Glass Enterprise Edition, replacing less hands-free options like capturing a video with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of Google Meet running on Google Glass" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1L0q_BYB0cnu4iRMmKSP8uSt3l4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719538/meet_glass_3.max_1600x1600.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ucDBkQ"&gt;Glass failed as a consumer product, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online"&gt;it found new life&lt;/a&gt; as a $999 enterprise headset that serves a similar niche to Microsoft HoloLens and (as of last year) Magic Leap headsets. Microsoft promotes a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhololens%2Fapps%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;paid HoloLens remote assistance tool&lt;/a&gt; that works similar to Meet with Glass.&lt;/p&gt;
