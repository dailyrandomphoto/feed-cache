    <title>NASA’s Mars copter survives brisk night alone in key pre-flight test</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UfZxZ"&gt;NASA’s mini Ingenuity helicopter survived its first night all alone on the surface of Mars after getting dropped off by Perseverance on Saturday. Weathering frigid Martian temperatures, the newly deployed rotorcraft passed an important test of independence, giving engineers confidence to proceed with a series of warming-up exercises in preparation for its first flight this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJayun"&gt;“That was one of the huge, huge achievements that we’ve been looking forward to, and now we can move on to the rest of the mission,” Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity deputy operations lead, said on Monday on a NASA live stream. “And now we’re on our own. We’re a separate spacecraft on Mars on our own energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWg5Cy"&gt;The four-pound, solar-powered craft arrived on Mars attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover on February 18th. The rover dropped Ingenuity’s protective covering last month to begin a meticulous, week-long deployment process that concluded last weekend, with Ingenuity’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;four landing legs firmly planted&lt;/a&gt; on the Martian surface for the first time. Soon after, Ingenuity’s 13-megapixel camera snapped its first image of the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-S0iyg3gQmHlwN3xnEPufsosUak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424771/1e_PIA24437.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5qvsnk"&gt;Perseverance backed away, kicking off the helicopter’s 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests and become the first craft to achieve powered flight on another world. Its first flight is currently slated for Sunday, April 11th, with confirmation on whether the attempt was successful arriving through the Mars-to-Earth data pipeline the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nARUe5"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed Ingenuity survived Mars’ freezing-cold nighttime temperatures of around -130 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday morning, after the copter sent signals back to Mars Base Station, a communications hub aboard Perseverance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4qqlL"&gt;For its first flight test this weekend, Ingenuity will rise nearly 10 feet from the surface and hover in place for roughly 30 seconds. It’ll pivot while hovering to demonstrate fluid movement, then begin a gradual descent for a landing. Engineers expect to receive images of Ingenuity’s hover on the morning of April 12th, along with troves of data on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAgLAW"&gt;Perseverance beamed back images of Ingenuity shortly after dropping it off on its “helipad,” a small space on one side of its running track-shaped flight zone. Subsequent tests within Ingenuity’s 30-day test window include flying as high as 16 feet and zipping forward within the flight zone. The copter won’t carry out any science missions during its stay on Mars; engineers have emphasized this is just a flight demonstration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an5eVy"&gt;Ingenuity’s twin-rotor system, spanning four feet, will spin in opposite rotations as quickly as 2,400 rpm to achieve lift in Mars’ ultrathin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4xDRe"&gt;Despite the copter’s tiny and lightweight design, it needs to be fully power-independent now that it has detached from Perseverance’s power supply. To do this, the craft has a solar panel above its propellers that powers six lithium-ion batteries in its tissue box-sized body, which also houses a computer roughly 100 times more powerful than Perseverance’s, and small heaters to keep itself warm through frigid Martian nights.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The creator of Threes is back with a game about slaying giant beasts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OxKpPoswTeXmzaLh8gQ9DPpgngY=/296x0:2237x1294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085445/Screen_Shot_2021_04_06_at_2.54.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PCtX4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt; designer Asher Vollmer is launching a new studio, Vodeo Games, and announced the company’s first game, a turn-based adventure called &lt;a href="https://vodeo.games/bb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beast Breaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoList"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beast Breake&lt;/em&gt;r stars Skipper, a tiny mouse warrior fighting mosaic monsters. The game relies on tactical choices via pinball-like mechanics; players can also craft equipment to assist them on their journey. It’s heading to Nintendo Switch and PC this summer. Vodeo released a brief trailer alongside the news today that shows off the game’s quick gameplay and colorful art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvj6jK"&gt;On its website, Vodeo says it plans to release small, intimate games “full of complex, interlocking systems that can take years to fully master,” once every year. The studio is &lt;a href="https://vodeo.games/game2"&gt;already teasing a second one&lt;/a&gt; as part of its plan to work on multiple projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbqRB1"&gt;Since releasing&lt;em&gt; Threes&lt;/em&gt;, Vollmer has continued to work on other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8294765/indie-game-one-hit-wonder-minecraft-threes"&gt;experimental projects&lt;/a&gt;, including low-fi peasant-simulator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/30/8522963/royals-game-threes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Royals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Apple Arcade fantasy title &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954926/apple-arcade-guildlings-game-launch-threes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guildlings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on how India’s digital revolution started with missed calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ECONOMY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ygzgFnXJjndxRvgNs35f9_Mc5E=/0x3:8367x5581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085277/1231334394.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEWEL SAMAD/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KREkbs"&gt;Leaving a missed call on someone’s phone usually signals that you should call them back — but at one point in India, it was communication in its own right. &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;A new feature by Atul Bhattarai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; examines the Indian culture that grew up around missed calls — and the startups that took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeXSb9"&gt;In basic terms, a “missed call” means dialing a person but hanging up before they can answer. Hanging up without talking let users send a basic message (“I called”) without getting charged for minutes or SMS messages — like paging someone without a pager. Bhattarai focuses on ZipDial, a company that turned missed calls into a robust advertising business and a way to experience some of the features of online life without paying for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V18Uz"&gt;As Bhattarai writes, using missed calls to communicate came about because of the high cost of cellphone data and limited access to high-speed internet. Calling long enough to connect to someone else’s phone and then hanging up or not picking up on the other end avoided being charged for the call. These missed calls could mean a variety of things, like letting a friend know you’re on your way or a loved one know that you miss them. “The fact that the missed call demanded only basic numeric literacy made them accessible to the third of India’s population that was illiterate,” Bhattarai explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu1ehq"&gt;ZipDial combined the missed call trend and preexisting SMS services into a kind of a one-stop shop for cellphone owners who wanted basic internet functionality. ZipDial would partner with a brand and set up a hotline that people could call for services like sports scores or celebrity tweets. All it took was “signing up” with a missed call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINvf7"&gt;Bhattarai also highlights a proto-Spotify algorithmic playlist service called Kan Khajura, which delivered new music in 15-minute calls. “Kan Khajura’s central appeal was that it could be accessed anywhere and anytime, unlike the radio and TV,” Bhattarai writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkuUeq"&gt;Those businesses became unsustainable as mobile data became cheaper, and ZipDial ceased operations in 2016. But Bhattarai argues the services helped bridge the offline-online gap in a period before internet service providers and physical infrastructure caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWi18q"&gt;You can read the full feature on &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;ZipDial’s missed call empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Rest of World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea is working with Sonos on a hidden speaker built into art you hang on the wall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGae2NmCSMaP9XKPgFdN9f7Vzo4=/111x0:1755x1096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085093/Screen_Shot_2021_04_06_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyVQSv"&gt;Ikea and Sonos are starting to tease the next products that the two companies have collaborated on. The furniture giant today &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/speakers/news/sonos/156425-sonos-confirms-new-ikea-symfonisk-speaker-is-coming"&gt;posted an Instagram story&lt;/a&gt; that directly mentions the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;“Symfonisk” line&lt;/a&gt; and flashes the Sonos logo at the end, so there’s little doubt that new hardware is coming soon. Two fresh filings have also just appeared at the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfg6so"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can exclusively share details on what’s coming. The first new product, &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;covered in this filing&lt;/a&gt;, is a revamped version of the Symfonisk table lamp. It’s expected to be sold for around the same price ($179) as the original product, which basically stuffed the sound quality of a Sonos Play:1 into the body of a lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KVJwc"&gt;But from what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands, the $99 Symfonisk bookshelf speaker — the most affordable gateway into the Sonos platform — is not due for any major updates. Instead, the second product that Ikea and Sonos will announce in 2021 is completely new: a piece of wall art with an integrated speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bA8mj97J1mfqbKBAaGNxjMWwC44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18332906/cwelch_190724_3559_2256.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea and Sonos are also preparing an updated table lamp speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7EOksw"&gt;Companies like Soundwall have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14686272/soundwall-nova-launch-speaker-art"&gt;produced artwork speakers before&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s safe to assume that Ikea and Sonos are targeting a price point that’s dramatically lower than those expensive products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfwlz6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has seen an early image of this product, codenamed “Titan,” but details about how it functions couldn’t yet be learned. Specifically, it’s unclear whether the entire artwork print is the product or if the speaker unit can be transferred between different exterior art housings. One of the two new FCC filings from Ikea and Sonos is for &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;a “wireless module.”&lt;/a&gt; At a distance, it could look like any of Ikea’s wall prints, only with much more tech on the other side (and a power cord running down from the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="dPk7BM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="au8RD2"&gt;All of the Symfonisk products so far have been designed with a dual purpose in mind. The lamp combines a speaker and light source; the bookshelf speaker can literally be used as a shelf when mounted to a wall. And they’re also meant to blend into home decor. From that angle, combining artwork and a music speaker seems like a natural progression for the Symfonisk series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5A99o"&gt;I’ve heard from a fair number of Sonos customers who use the Symfonisk bookshelf speakers as rear surrounds for Sonos’ Arc and Beam soundbars. They work very well for that purpose, but a stereo pair of wall art speakers could make for an even sleeker home theater setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2V8Em"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have not yet revealed exactly when they plan to announce their latest collaborative efforts. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sonos for comment. In the immediate future, Sonos is gearing up for the launch of its new Sonos Roam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a product first leaked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which starts shipping on April 20th. You can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;full review of that excellent portable speaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is testing a payments feature that lets you send cryptocurrency to friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7krYp4GTId4FksGKcsb8NJz0nNM=/48x0:2073x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084630/payments_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYv2gU"&gt;Signal &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it’s now testing a new peer-to-peer payments system in the beta version of its apps. Appropriately called Signal Payments, the new feature right now supports only one protocol: the MobileCoin wallet and its companion cryptocurrency MOB. MobileCoin has a close relationship with Signal co-founder and CEO Moxie Marlinspike, who advised the company prior to its &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/"&gt;most recent round of funding announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uc7YcI"&gt;“The first payments protocol we’ve added support for is a privacy focused payments network called MobileCoin, which has its own currency, MOB,” wrote Jun Harada, Signal’s head of growth and communication, in a &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/help-us-test-payments-in-signal/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, our goal is to keep your data in your hands rather than ours; MobileCoin’s design means Signal does not have access to your balance, full transaction history, or funds. You can also transfer your funds at any time if you want to switch to another app or service.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6_fQUckH7quKkzlE6YPQUuKLaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424615/payments_product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rOAFc"&gt;The company says those interested in trying out the feature must live in the UK for now, and those who qualify can sign up for MobileCoin and access the feature through the &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;Signal beta&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a beta feature in a &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-"&gt;beta build&lt;/a&gt;, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback,” Harada writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s no longer replenishing Oculus Rift S supplies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdsR_YTG0naX8qvqM2cWpIsJrGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084618/nstatt_190318_3307_9378.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjAZn4"&gt;Facebook says Oculus Rift S headsets “generally” won’t be replenished as they disappear from store shelves, marking the end of the virtual reality system’s life span. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/rift-s-dead"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, Facebook has confirmed that “generally speaking, as channels sell out of stock, they won’t be replenished moving forward.” The PC-tethered headset is unavailable through Oculus’ store, and it’s out of stock on retail platforms like Amazon and Walmart in the US, except from third-party sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyNG5W"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that it would discontinue the Oculus Rift S in 2021. While the headset was a successor to the landmark Oculus Rift, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523941/oculus-rift-s-review-vr-headset-price-specs-features"&gt;compromised on features&lt;/a&gt; like screen resolution and refresh rate, particularly compared to high-end PC-based competitors like the Valve Index. Meanwhile, Facebook shifted its focus to the self-contained Oculus Quest, a mobile headset that can also be plugged into a desktop PC — making it functionally a replacement for the Rift S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqUCat"&gt;According to some reports, that strategy was a marked departure from Oculus’ earlier plans. Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe left the company in 2018, reportedly after Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/oculus-co-founder-is-leaving-facebook-after-cancellation-of-rift-2-headset/"&gt;canceled a higher-end&lt;/a&gt; “Rift 2” headset. Also-departed Oculus founder Palmer Luckey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1379260970090946562"&gt;alluded to that rumor&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter today, saying he was “imagining a world where Rift 2 was not cancelled shortly before going into production and then cancelled again in favor of a much lower spec Lenovo rebadge.” (The Oculus Rift S was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273152/oculus-rift-s-vr-headset-announced-pricing-release-date-features-gdc-2019"&gt;produced in partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Lenovo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roIvSx"&gt;Moving to standalone designs, though, has apparently worked well for Facebook so far. Facebook says last year’s Oculus Quest 2 has &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/quest-2-outsells-oculus-headsets-combined/"&gt;outsold all previous&lt;/a&gt; Oculus headsets combined. The device has established Facebook as the dominant VR headset company at the price of ceding high-end PC-based VR to competitors including Valve, HTC, and HP. And Facebook has indicated that it’s continuing the Quest line for the near future — with CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;saying he’s already imagining&lt;/a&gt; “Quest 3 and 4” headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Fallon will play Among Us with streamers and the cast of Stranger Things in Twitch debut</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpQzLf"&gt;Jimmy Fallon is making his Twitch debut on Tuesday evening in what promises to be some hilarious rounds of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; with a star-studded group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IYuv"&gt;Fallon will be joined by The Roots’ Questlove, Tariq Trotter, and Kirk Douglas; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;stars Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers) and Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin Henderson); streamers Sykkuno and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter; YouTuber Corpse Husband; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; developer InnerSloth’s community director, Victoria Tran. With so many big names participating, Fallon’s stream has the potential to be huge, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) two streams of &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/aoc-returns-twitch-playing-among-us-jagmeet-singh-xqc-disguisedtoast/"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLap02"&gt;The group will be playing Tuesday starting at 6:45PM ET, and you can watch it &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmyfallon"&gt;on Fallon’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. Parts from the stream will air on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-twitch-among-us-stranger-things"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmvFyi"&gt;The group will be playing on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ huge new Airship map, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;was released on March 31st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362177/among-us-airship-update-map-sneaky-crewmate-imposter"&gt;The new map is full of ways&lt;/a&gt; for imposters to be sneaky, which I’m sure will lead to some ridiculous moments during Tuesday’s stream. (The game also now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;has a poop hat&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if anyone will wear it?)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned Nvidia’s RTX Voice works on older GTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia geforce gtx 1080" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUqOLwarugZW9PxNuJhow9X60Sg=/164x0:3676x2341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69083253/WwBCPl4.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DceaT"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX Voice feature that eliminates background noises that would otherwise come through your microphone debuted exclusively on costly RTX graphics cards. My colleague Taylor Lyles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;wrote back in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; that the company patched RTX Voice software to run on older GeForce GTX, Quadro, or Titan-branded GPUs all the way back in September 2020, but I was just reminded of it today from &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-voice-works-on-pascal-maxwell-kepler"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4O5WU"&gt;Given that Nvidia’s newest RTX 30-series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;graphics cards are pricey and tough to find&lt;/a&gt; (as are just about any kind of somewhat capable GPU), this is a good way to extend the utility of older hardware if you don’t want to upgrade yet. If your graphics card is running Nvidia’s 410.18 driver, models down to the GTX 600-series released in 2012 should be able to run the feature once you download it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fguides%2Fnvidia-rtx-voice-setup-guide%2F%23RTX-Voice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22369740%2Fnvidia-rtx-voice-noise-canceling-features-gtx-geforce-quadro-titan-graphics-cards-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s a link to the download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zuwLj"&gt;Once you have that installed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229508/nvidia-rtx-voice-background-noise-reduce-graphics-card-improve-call-quality"&gt;check out the how-to guide&lt;/a&gt; that my colleague Jon Porter wrote that goes through the steps on configuring your sound settings to take advantage of RTX Voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJYHNR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally written as if this feature coming to non-RTX GPUs was new. Nvidia confirmed to The Verge that it has been available since late September 2020 when &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia debuted its Broadcast app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yahoo Answers was the most earnest place on the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Playa Vista Exteriors And Landmarks - 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DYmOgSiGXd2IaJrA5NSs7xKWWfU=/0x243:5100x3643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084333/1229095599.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEfH0Y"&gt;“Who do you blame for Yahoo Answers getting shut down?” reads &lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210405155122AA3yax3"&gt;one of the final queries&lt;/a&gt; ever submitted to the venerable advice service. As of press time, it has garnered more than 250 responses, all from those who’ve regularly doled out their imperfect observations to countless eighth-graders, chronic hypochondriacs, political firebrands, and curious stoners throughout the 15-year life span of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIs6ii"&gt;The premise of Yahoo Answers was simple: ask any question you want and receive solutions from anyone in the world. “[It] likely doesn’t turn a profit … instead of spending the money necessary to moderate they just decided to close the whole thing down,” theorizies a user named Bill, who has penned 11,182 of these answers during his career on the forum. Elsewhere, veterans blame the liberals or the conservatives, or lay the fault at the feet of the parent company, Verizon. There is no right or wrong way to contend with the death of an internet giant, especially when the inevitable is on the horizon. On May 4th, Yahoo Answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368488/yahoo-answers-shutdown-may-4-internet-era-over-rip"&gt;will enter a permanent read-only mode&lt;/a&gt; and functionally cease to exist. We may never know &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-lia-FEIY"&gt;how babby is formed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5T3MWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A public good mutated into yet another exhausting battlefront&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EvC55d"&gt;It’s unclear why Yahoo Answers is being sunset now. The company isn’t terminating any of its other services. Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and Yahoo Mail will all continue to exist. Yahoo simply said the product has become “less popular over the years” and suggested that it does not “deliver on Yahoo’s promise of providing premium trusted content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YxuoQ"&gt;Forum habitués speculate that this execution is a result of the site’s glacial rhetorical shift toward psychedelic conspiracy and heated partisanship in recent years. Currently, the front page includes such burning inquiries like, “&lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210405002134AAlHJl0"&gt;Will America survive 4 years of Joe Biden?&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20210403163008AAeHjyO"&gt;Will the summer be record riots by BLM and antifa?&lt;/a&gt;” In the thread where a user asks who is responsible for the site coming to an unceremonious end, someone replies: “left-wingers, they don’t want people to know the truth.” In that sense, maybe Bill’s postulation is right. Perhaps the powers that be at Yahoo simply grew tired of watching a public good mutate into yet another exhausting battlefront in the interminable American culture war and opted to cut their losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqwal5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can still misbehave!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PVVpd"&gt;That is the great tragedy of Yahoo Answers. Long before aggrieved reactionaries became barnacles to its abandoned underside in order to spout talking points imported directly from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ingraham Angle&lt;/em&gt;, it existed as an extremely sincere, extremely harebrained epicenter of mindless juvenile interests. You can still see shadows of that former life, even now, if you look hard enough. “What does it feel like to be 50 years old?” writes one poster, a day before the announced shuttering. “I’m 17 I can’t even imagine what it must feel like to have been on planet Earth for that long.” The Yahoo Answers braintrust immediately mobilized to sate the thirst for knowledge. As usual, the results were scattershot in their saliency and applicability. “I am 61 and at that awkward age for men between 16 and 70,” answers an anonymous user, who has Phil beat with a whopping 18,066 total posts. “I can still misbehave!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3BzC2"&gt;That was the spirit of the site; dubious questions met with dubious answers, the end result of trusting the ravenous pursuit of knowledge to those who possess enough free time to spend their days offering unverifiable insight to anonymous patrons. So many of the classic Yahoo Answers threads are written in a distinct mangled keyboard patois that belongs to both elementary-aged children and hunt-and-pecking sexagenarians alike. In 2021, when it feels like everyone in our life is chronically online, there is a strange, wistful sublimity in paging through the archives. Yahoo Answers represents an era where social media wasn’t chronically poisoned with irony and restless posturing; when the denizens of the internet were a little less afraid of the dreaded self-own. I already mentioned “How Is Babby Formed,” but who could forget, “&lt;a href="https://buzzghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Funny-Yahoo-Questions-And-Answers-11.jpg"&gt;Will my laptop get heavier if I put more files on it?&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://runt-of-the-web.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/yahoo-questions-dog-sex-education.jpg"&gt;What is the right age to start teaching my dog about sex?&lt;/a&gt;” It was the most earnest place on the internet. There are no dumb questions, only Yahoo Answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THyop"&gt;But unfortunately, nothing is safe from the great polarization of American society, where every scrap of digital terrain — from the subdivisions of 4Chan to your grandmother’s Facebook page — has been transformed into a focal point of perpetual political resentment. Not even Yahoo Answers, whose name implies a wholesome search for utilitarian, objective truth, was immune to the rising tide of boneheaded nationalism. It’s instructive, I think, to know that basic human courtesies, like posing and answering questions, have been irredeemably poisoned by the bad-faith instincts of the cursed, modern internet. There is simply no feasible way to subsist as a True Neutral web entity anymore. Yahoo Answers is just the latest casualty. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is building an electric Chevy Silverado with 400 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chevrolet 2019 Silverado Reveal Event Ahead Of The 2018 North American International Auto Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-xxH31jpEgUBjQihF3YmpsGaO4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084057/904641536.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0m6wKY"&gt;General Motors just &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/apr/0406-factory0.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s making an all-electric version of the Chevy Silverado pickup truck, the company’s bestselling vehicle. The new truck will be powered by GM’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;new EV battery&lt;/a&gt; and will offer around 400 miles on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izXau9"&gt;The company did not immediately say when the electric Silverado will go on sale, but GM president Mark Reuss said at an event on Tuesday that the company will also make commercial fleet-focused versions of the truck. GM has been &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34732462/gm-chevy-electric-truck-teased/"&gt;teasing an electric Silverado&lt;/a&gt; for months now. It previously said &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a31227446/chevy-electric-pickup-confirmed-2025/"&gt;it may not release a pickup EV until mid-decade&lt;/a&gt; and hadn’t officially announced the truck was coming until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBPerP"&gt;The electric Silverado will be made at “Factory Zero,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;recently rebranded Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to EVs and AVs that GM is currently retooling at a cost of more than $2 billion. It’s the same plant where GM will build the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;all-electric Hummer SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;Hummer pickup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vl6Nq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Announcing the first-ever electric &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silverado?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Silverado&lt;/a&gt; full-size truck, with a GM-estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge, will be built at Factory ZERO, Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7i5bqRNUt7"&gt;https://t.co/7i5bqRNUt7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1ONRFOfuAR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1ONRFOfuAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chevrolet (@chevrolet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chevrolet/status/1379467520911015936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nU3w2"&gt;An electric Silverado is a big step for GM and its Chevy brand — the automaker is planning to sell some 30 electric vehicles globally by 2025 — but it’s not too surprising considering that rival Ford already has an electric F-150 in the works. Ford’s electric pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;is due out next year&lt;/a&gt;. The Silverado is so important to GM that it’s currently selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;versions of the truck that are missing a microchip that helps improve fuel economy&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the global semiconductor shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHT7z9"&gt;A slew of other electric pickups are supposed to hit the market in the next few years. Rivian’s R1T pickup is due out later this year. Tesla’s Cybertruck is supposed to start shipping sometime around the end of this year or early 2022. GM’s own electric Hummer pickup is meant to go on sale around that same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6MX02"&gt;Many other startups are working on electric pickups, too, including Lordstown Motors — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;which is backed by GM&lt;/a&gt; and is planning to manufacture its trucks at the legacy automaker’s former factory in Lordstown, Ohio. GM was at one point negotiating to take a stake in electric trucking startup Nikola, which was working on a pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;before it became mired in scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, GM reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/gm-wanted-too-much-from-ev-start-up-rivian-opening-door-for-ford.html"&gt;wanted an exclusive deal with Rivian&lt;/a&gt;, which left room for Ford to partner up with that EV startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZT0fzv"&gt;The Silverado EV will undoubtedly be a flagship vehicle of the custom electric vehicle platform GM announced last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;called Ultium&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to be modular, the Ultium platform is what will power most of GM’s forthcoming electric vehicles. The company has promised the platform will be able to provide as much as 400 miles of range in the biggest configurations, and that the trucks built on Ultium will feature 800-volt architecture that allows for really fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAp5i8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
