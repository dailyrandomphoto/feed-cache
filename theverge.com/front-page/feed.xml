    <title>Pfizer says its antiviral pill reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rq77J7"&gt;Pfizer’s antiviral pill is highly effective at preventing people who catch COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill, the company said today &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-novel-covid-19-oral-antiviral-treatment-candidate"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. A clinical trial showed that the pill, which has the brand name Paxlovid, cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent for adults at high risk of developing severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsFXH1"&gt;The company said it plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization “as soon as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uJta"&gt;This is the second effective anti-COVID-19 pill. The first, developed by pharmaceutical company Merck, cut risk of hospitalization and death &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/covid-antiviral-pill-merck.html"&gt;by about half&lt;/a&gt;. The United Kingdom’s health agency authorized the Merck pill &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, and the FDA’s advisory committee is scheduled to discuss it &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-merck-and-ridgebacks-eua-application-covid-19-oral"&gt;on November 30th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAOK6i"&gt;Pfizer tested its drug in a study that included 1,219 adults who tested positive for COVID-19, had mild or moderate symptoms, and who had at least one underlying medical condition that would put them at risk for a severe case of the disease (like diabetes or a lung condition). Participants were randomly assigned to either take a course of placebo pills or the active drug. Three people in the active drug group were hospitalized and none died. In the placebo group, 27 people were hospitalized and seven died. The data was announced in a press release and has not been published in a scientific journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkqd3V"&gt;The Pfizer treatment works by stopping the coronavirus from making copies of itself inside cells. It includes 30 pills taken over five days. Merck’s, which works in a similar way, requires 40 pills taken over five days. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22704265/merck-covid-19-antiviral-pill-molnupiravir-treatment-drug"&gt;cheaper than&lt;/a&gt; treatments like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176631/coroniavirus-antibody-treatment-doses-unused-warp-speed"&gt;monoclonal antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which also can keep people from becoming seriously ill. They’re also logistically easier to use — pills can be taken at home, while antibody treatments are given through an infusion at a health center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1Zs75"&gt;The challenge with antiviral treatments like the Pfizer pill is ensuring that people are able to access them in the short window when they’re most effective. If people aren’t able to get a COVID-19 test result or make it to a doctor within the first few days after they start feeling sick, they likely won’t be able to get the same benefits from the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr1t2q"&gt;Medications taken after someone gets sick also aren’t a replacement for vaccines, which can prevent people from getting sick in the first place. But antiviral pills are an important tool to fight COVID-19. “I think getting an oral pill that can inhibit viral replication — that can inhibit this virus — is going to be a real game changer,” former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiPOwV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fake press release claiming Kroger accepts crypto reached the retailer’s own webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Bitcoin Cash logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyVB1-soYz4vdW2pZ2eQTbhgHEA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099845/1234440443.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudencio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vco3YT"&gt;Cryptocurrency and blockchain news presents many headlines that are hard to believe, so when a seemingly authentic press release ties a major retail outlet to second-tier crypto, it can take a moment to find out the truth. That was the case with a fake “Walmart takes Litecoin” release in September, and again this morning as PR Newswire &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-to-accept-bitcoin-cash-this-holiday-season-301417472.html"&gt;published an illegitimate announcement&lt;/a&gt; claiming Kroger will start accepting Bitcoin Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YA3gd4"&gt; Because Kroger’s webpage pulls in the releases from PR Newswire, the fake release actually appeared on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FKroger.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kroger.com&lt;/a&gt; until it was removed. Kroger has been linked to cryptocurrency but does not accept it as payment. A partnership &lt;a href="https://blog.lolli.com/earn-bitcoin-back-at-kroger/"&gt;announced with Lolli late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowed users of that rewards program to earn small amounts of Bitcoin back on purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97j63K"&gt;Kroger PR confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Bitcoin Cash release is fake and quickly issued a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WniJnZ"&gt;This morning a press release was fraudulently issued claiming to be The Kroger Co. that falsely stated the organization will begin to accept Bitcoin Cash. This communication was fraudulent and is unfounded and should be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2PJx1qvniAnlSFT0Tigv_hKtWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988094/coinbase_bch_price.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fbitcoin-cash&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsAkyY"&gt;In less than 15 minutes, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fbitcoin-cash&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Coinbase shows&lt;/a&gt; the price of Bitcoin Cash rose &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/bitcoin-cash-briefly-spikes-on-fraudulent-press-release/"&gt;nearly 5 percent&lt;/a&gt;, going from about $602 to $630, which was likely the point of the hoax. It returned to the previous level almost immediately, but whoever was behind the scheme may have netted a profit already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmlyDc"&gt;Bitcoin Cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16075276/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-coinbase"&gt;arose from a contentious chain split in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, as its proponents made a “hard fork” from Bitcoin, claiming that cryptocurrency hasn’t addressed high transfer fees and block size limitations. Coinbase halted trading for a time under accusations of insider trading, while in the years since the value of Bitcoin Cash has not kept up with the massive spikes seen from Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro is selling for its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lq8_4xTg1mDHuMbfOw-7-nj8J4I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099758/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new $1,399 12.9-inch iPad Pro is selling for $1,249 instead&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932FH25J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWafjgPfUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 512GB, Wi-Fi version of the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for its lowest price yet. Normally $1,399, the retailer is selling it for $1,249 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this the best and nicest iPad out there. Powered by Apple’s M1 processor, the 2021 iPad Pro is a speed demon and it comes with features like Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, Apple Pencil support, as well as Face ID unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd91ge"&gt;As we noted yesterday, if you’re looking for something cheaper and smaller, Apple’s 2021 11-inch iPad Pro (128GB, Wi-Fi) is also on sale, selling for $699 instead of $799 at at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVKgWMaDgM?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527112%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YtmtDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845841"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7Phiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SypmRr"&gt;Supply might sell out sooner than later, but at eBay the reputable seller BuyDig is offering a fabulous deal on LG’s 48-inch C1 OLED TV. Normally around $1,300 while on sale, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324842746233%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22763370%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-gopro-hero-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a four-year accidental extended warranty. Better yet, after you purchase, &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15376480-48-lg-oled48c1pub-4k-smart-oled-tv-100-ebay-credit-4-year-accidental-warranty-w-burn-in-coverage-1099-free-s-h-at-ebay?src=frontpage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that your account will be credited $100, so it’s like getting the TV for $1,000 flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="laDMPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOWsR"&gt;You can also save hundreds on an Intel-powered Apple laptop, if you’d prefer one over an iPad today. And even though it doesn’t come with the M1 processor, it’s still a fast, powerful MacBook in its own right. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mid-2020 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, and a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor for $1,500 instead of $1,999. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised this MacBook Pro’s keyboard and build quality, calling it a “competent, dependable laptop.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2O5aOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VKBXx"&gt;For Android users who are eager to snag a folding phone, Amazon has a great deal on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. Released just a few months ago in August, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 touts a more durable screen than its predecessors, with 120Hz refresh rate displays, support for the S Pen, and IPX8 water resistance. Its main drawback, usually, is that it can be very expensive, but today’s deal shaving $200 off makes it more affordable. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097CMYTLD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is the selling the 256GB foldable phone for $1,600&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HGBG94S?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $80 extra&lt;/a&gt;, you can also add an S Pen case to your order. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TKYAPK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lDfUD"&gt;Best Buy is taking $200 off of one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $529 for the previous-gen model with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of SSD storage, and an Intel 10th Gen Core i3 processor, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it now for $329&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found this Chromebook outperforms many others when it comes to features, build quality, and performance. Although it lacks Intel’s 11th Gen processor and Thunderbolt 4 support, we found that it boasts slightly better battery life than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEq0RM"&gt;However, if you’d prefer the latest version with an Intel Evo-certified 11th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and Thunderbolt 4 support, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling that&lt;/a&gt; one for $529 instead of $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hwmpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKPznw"&gt;If you’re going on an adventurous vacation soon and want to take great photos and video clips, check out this GoPro Hero 9 deal. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; last year, we called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt; the “biggest, baddest action camera out there.” The portable action camera is capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos, and it can also be used to record in a variety of settings, including underwater. Right now, the GoPro Hero 9 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVPVzIXaMN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $350, the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ElvxWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="seU8L7"&gt;Best Buy is taking $100 off of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVSQ4vPqZp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 32-inch UltraGear QHD Nano IPS display&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $500, you can buy the gaming monitor for $400 instead. This monitor features thin bezels and a 16:9 aspect ratio with a sharp 2560 x 1440 resolution. It’s fast, boasting a 165Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time, and it’s also compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync technologies. We might see slightly lower prices come Black Friday, but those who are in the market for a capable 32-inch gaming market should check this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEwZtz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846505"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9u2IVi"&gt;PC or Xbox gamers can now now enjoy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt; for $38 instead of $45 when they buy it off of Amazon. With the subscription, you can get access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, for a multitude of devices. This deal is particularly good for existing subscribers as you can use it to add three months to your existing subscription. Eneba’s also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/xbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global/best-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; for $29, but that price often fluctuates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IudFYC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Dune movie flushed away a chance to talk about wastewater</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Stillsuits reclaim more than just sweat and tears&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tRxXMt"&gt;Nearly an hour into the new &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; film, our favorite colonizing scamps, the Atreides boys, are introduced to a Fremen technology staple that allows them to survive Arrakis’ harsh desert environment. In the original 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, the stillsuit is full-body attire that recycles potable water from literally every drop of moisture produced by the wearer, including sweat, tears, feces, urine, and even breath (it would also theoretically work as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dune-stillsuits-maxi-pad/"&gt;period-recycling apparatus&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypCjLm"&gt;In 2021, it appears that Denis Villeneuve is not a fan of drinking recycled pee. “A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system,” explains Dr. Liet Kynes (played by Sharon Duncan-Brewster), the Imperial Ecologist tasked to work with House Atreides. “It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat. Your body’s movements provide the power. Inside the mask you’ll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.” In a later scene, after Paul and Jessica have a cathartic family cry in their Fremen tent — an efficient structure that works similarly to the stillsuit — Paul urges his mother to drink. “It’s recycled water from the tent,” he says, “sweat and tears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRHDQZ"&gt;A few criticisms of Villeneuve’s movie have been that it was too flat, too beige, too sanitized, and didn’t seize the opportunity to get sufficiently weird with the source material. I’m usually a simple moviegoer with simple needs. My umbrage with the new &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is far more basic: removing a real-life sustainable solution from a pioneering work of climate fiction is peepeepoopoo erasure, especially when our disintegrating planet has so little left to give us. It’s time to destigmatize recycled piss water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UQ6Mmt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dune review: a movie that puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UzwZE7"&gt;I first tried drinking recycled sewage water in 2005, when the Singapore government introduced &lt;a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/fournationaltaps/newater"&gt;NEWater&lt;/a&gt; to the population; the idea of recycling municipal wastewater has been around since the 1970s when it was clear that the country didn’t have enough clean water sources of its own. Most Singaporeans grow up acutely conscious of the fact that half the country’s potable water supply comes from &lt;a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/fournationaltaps/importedwater"&gt;an agreement with Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; that expires in 2061. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re9bp8"&gt;“The PUB (Public Utilities Board), for many decades, sat down in meetings that are organized in community centers,” says &lt;a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/interdisciplinary/staff/ceciliatortajada"&gt;Cecilia Tortajada&lt;/a&gt;, a former adjunct senior research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Water Policy who has advised numerous international environmental organizations and is currently based at the University of Glasgow. “And they would take notes of anything that referred to water and then bring it back to the planning table and to the policy table ... and this is how they found out that scarcity was a concern of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1bngSxKOu1WA0FLt04ePxBYmWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985791/rev_1_DUN_T2_0040r_High_Res_JPEG__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EeLWLR"&gt;I couldn’t tell you whether NEWater tastes noticeably different from “normal” water, even with the preexisting knowledge of its origins, because 16 years later, I don’t care. I do remember, though, the jokes and outright disgust expressed at the time NEWater rolled out, but more importantly, how quickly everyone accepted it and moved on. When you grow up surrounded by constant ambient rhetoric about water scarcity, even in a hyper-efficient capitalistic wet dream like Singapore, recycled drinking water is just fine. What I do know is that I can turn on the tap, stick my head under it like a cartoon, and drink whatever comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmu6Iz"&gt;“I find it very progressive, very enlightening, the idea of using all the resources you have,” says Tortajada. “If you have fresh water, if you have the rainfall and you have somewhere to store it, that is the best option and the cheapest option,” she says. “But there are places where there is water scarcity, so what is the next option? You use the resources available.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="n15xlp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These innovations, many times, come out of bright ideas or out of necessity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LauPy"&gt;Tortajada points out that when it comes to technological innovations, the United States is, more often than not, first. But in the world of recycled drinking water, it’s Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia, which built the first large-scale recycled drinking water system in 1968. Even today, Windhoek is still the only place in the world where recycled drinking water can be piped directly into people’s homes. &lt;a href="https://www.ocwd.com/gwrs/"&gt;In Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt; and Singapore, there’s still a “middleman” step where a percentage of recycled wastewater gets blended in with reservoirs and aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDUURh"&gt;“These innovations, many times, come out of bright ideas or out of necessity,” Tortajada explains. As such, recycled drinking water is usually only accepted by the people who actually need it. If you hadn’t already guessed by now, the thought of drinking recycled wastewater — a varietal blend of strangers’ pee and poop — is too disgusting for many people to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA8z0S"&gt;Ching Leong, an associate professor at the Institute of Water Policy who specializes in “irrational environmental behavior,” unpacked the finer points of this particular sentiment in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/548"&gt;a 2016 paper&lt;/a&gt; that compared the resounding success of Windhoek with a failed water reclamation project in LA’s East Valley. “The ‘yuck’ factor has been found to be the only statistically significant factor in empirical studies variously defined as ‘psychological repugnance,’ ‘disgust,’ or ‘profound discomfort,’” she wrote. “Implementation of [recycled drinking water] is still rare, despite its existence for more than 40 years, and despite policy makers and international agencies lauding it as a sustainable option for water supply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJjKv9"&gt;It doesn’t help that much dystopian sci-fi and pop culture humor leans hard into this disgust. Kevin Costner in &lt;em&gt;Waterworld&lt;/em&gt; faces the ultimate mockery of being surrounded by ocean, yet must scavenge for clean water and use his own spit to water his sole plant. Survivalist Bear Grylls is best known for drinking his own urine as an act of survival (something that then-President &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obama-refuses-to-drink-his-own-pee-shows-his-human-side-on-bear-grylls"&gt;Obama declined to do&lt;/a&gt; on Grylls’ show), though the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/05/is-it-a-good-idea-to-drink-urine-when-water-is-scarce.html"&gt;Army Field Manual&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t recommend it. Since 2009, NASA astronauts have used a Urine Processor Assembly that can reclaim &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/34688-recycled-astronaut-pee-boosts-deep-space-travel.html"&gt;75 percent of water from their urine&lt;/a&gt;; today the tech has improved to the point where astronauts can safely drink it, but space travel is still far from being a comfortable experience for the average person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Nb_FYKAJgy_Wg3CuizIk_XP9iI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985793/rev_1_DUN_T2_0092_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMz0Ex"&gt;It’s especially interesting to think about our collective cultural reaction to drinking pee-water within the context of Leong’s research on emotions. Recycled water is objectively one of the cleanest things on the planet and is held to extremely rigorous standards. Yet, we only really see fictional instances of it in dire situations where survival is paramount. Leong’s case study of the East Valley water recycling failure points to a fundamental failure in communication, as in this line of work, good information campaigns are critical to helping people understand and accept recycled drinking water. Tortajada holds up the PUB’s NEWater rollout as a success story where transparency was key — there was a carefully planned campaign and the government opened a visitor’s center where people can take a tour and try bottles of NEWater for themselves. Most importantly, it was always clear what NEWater is: recycled wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGOsTI"&gt;“[Recycled drinking water] is the best alternative we have,” Tortajada says. “Not the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;— is the &lt;em&gt;best &lt;/em&gt;alternative we have. Because acceptance also comes in terms of pricing. So you cannot produce a source of water that would be so expensive that people would have to choose between paying [for their children’s school] or having water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0q7if"&gt;Even if you aren’t falling over backward to drink recycled sewage, you should probably know that it’s just really goddamn clean. “It is through recycling that you get the cleanest water,” Tortajada says, explaining that the PUB does double the number of quality checks than the standard parameters. According to her, water today is more polluted than ever, and that most people prefer bottled water despite the fact that the quality of bottled water often tests poorly compared to tap water in developed cities (and in some cases, bottled water is simply &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/truth-about-tap"&gt;repackaged tap water sold without oversight&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FgBzPD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fremen relationship with water is marked by respect, practicality, and a hint of subdued reverence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn8MCZ"&gt;As to whether pop culture plays a significant role in the general public’s acceptance of recycled water, Tortajada says yes. “It depends on how communication is managed,” she says, pointing to failed projects in Queensland, Australia and San Diego where people weren’t given enough information, the public balked, and the projects were canceled. Within these sentiments are threads of classism, exceptionalism, and a deeply ingrained idea of what near-future dystopia looks like. For instance, in Leong’s East Valley case study, the strong “yuck” factor was associated with a sense of social justice — the perception that wealthier west LA would be getting “good” water, while poorer people were left with toilet water. Wildly fictional narratives in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fury Roa&lt;/em&gt;d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIfMAhK7Boo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tank Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aren’t quite as silly when real-life cartoon villain CEOs claim that &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/waterbarons/water-and-politics-fall-suharto/"&gt;water should be privatized&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/waterbarons/cholera-and-age-water-barons/"&gt;corporations take advantage of corrupt governments to control clean water supplies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YXozG"&gt;Public acceptance is a problem for governments, policymakers, and science communicators, but it should also be addressed in the softer, subtle language of film, literature, and television. On the cultural front, perhaps it’s time we also shifted away from thinking of recycled toilet water in a dystopian context into one about positive long-term sustainability. The Fremen relationship with water is marked by respect, practicality, and a hint of subdued reverence for its properties, even when it’s been recycled from poop collected in your stillsuit’s thigh pads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="062m0Q"&gt;Like Paul Atreides, his cursed descendants, and even the Bene Gesserit, long-term planning seems to be the name of the game when you want people to accept an unpalatable reality. The real narrative of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is an eons-long cycle of reshaping a planet and toying with inevitability, with a lot of proselytizing and preaching in between. We don’t have the luxury of that kind of time, nor do we have magic spice powers to make anything happen. But in the parlance of Leto Atreides — lord of air and sea power and would-be harnesser of desert power — perhaps the trick to conquering water scarcity is actually toilet power, and we need to stop being weird about it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code suggests Google’s folding Pixel will return to 12-megapixel camera next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UDdpgPW5i6DLdApNvtrnMrWNRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099537/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhPdxC"&gt;Google’s rumored foldable device could release next year with similar camera hardware to what older Pixel phones used prior to this year’s big Pixel 6 overhaul, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reports about the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;first emerged this summer&lt;/a&gt;, at which point it was expected to launch before the end of the year. Now the device, whose codename appears to have changed from “Passport” to “Pipit,” seems to be on track for a launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD9huF"&gt;These latest details have emerged thanks to code discovered in the Google Camera app. In particular, they suggest that the foldable will use a 12.2-megapixel IMX363 sensor for its main camera. That suggests the foldable won’t be equipped with the same 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 camera sensor Google used on this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the IMX363 is the sensor Google used for the Pixel 3 through 5. Its lower resolution suggests the foldable might struggle to match the excellent camera quality of the Pixel 6 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z77dsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google switched to a 50-megapixel main sensor with the Pixel 6&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwxnjy"&gt;Aside from the main sensor, the code snippets suggest the Pixel foldable’s other cameras will be more in line with the Pixel 6. There’s a 12-megapixel IMX386 that’s expected to handle ultrawide shots and two 8-megapixel IMX355 sensors for its selfie cameras. Two selfie cameras appear to be necessary to allow selfies to be taken while the foldable is both open and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sfjZd"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, it’s not uncommon to see companies equip foldables with less powerful camera hardware than their flagships. The recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, for example, had a 12-megapixel sensor rather than the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But it might be a disappointment for anyone expecting Google’s rumored foldable to match the camera quality of its latest flagships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYy3l"&gt;A release date of next year makes sense for the foldable given what we know about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;Android 12L&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming Android update that’s due to launch early next year and is designed to offer a range of improvements for devices with larger screens, including foldables. The update, which has previously been referred to as Android 12.1, also contains code suggesting Google might have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;second foldable device in development&lt;/a&gt; under the codename “Jumbojack.” It’s unclear when, or even if, this second foldable may be released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s latest overkill gaming phones arrive in Europe with up to 18GB of RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwUsM0jHvmwjR7mNiHB8BMW66kI=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099241/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro, which has a small display on its rear.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPFt5t"&gt;Asus has announced pricing for the ROG Phone 5S series in Europe, following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;launch in Taiwan in August&lt;/a&gt;. The ROG Phone 5S costs €999 for 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, while €1,099 gets you a step-up model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The top of the line 5S Pro has an excessive 18GB of RAM and the same 512GB of storage and retails for €1,299. Meanwhile in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/asus/158977-asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket-Lint&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 16GB model will cost £999, and the 18GB Pro model will set you back £1,099, but there’s no mention of pricing for the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhmTIR"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro are functionally minor updates to the ROG Phone 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that Asus released earlier this year. They have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus processor and their screens have a more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate (their 144Hz refresh rates are unchanged), but the core specs remain the same. They still have 6.78-inch 1080p displays, 6,000mAh batteries, and triple-rear camera array with 64-megapixel main sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GF2DBifVWw0Z2mNXy6H_kAYIcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22987984/h732.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJJAmG"&gt;Although European pricing for the phones has now been announced, exact release dates seem to vary from country to country. In the UK, for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fuk%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ online store&lt;/a&gt; currently doesn’t offer links to preorder the phones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ffr%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In France&lt;/a&gt; the 16GB model of the ROG Phone 5S is available to buy now, but the 12GB and 18GB RAM variants are due to ship on November 19th. We’re yet to hear about any US release plans for the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will finally let you join multiplayer games without an invite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTBbUTWOJVT_cmI_OPIf1jAESRA=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099126/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cMmzYF"&gt;Google is finally allowing Stadia players to join multiplayer games without needing an invite. This basic feature is available on most console platforms and PC launchers, but it has taken Google nearly two years to add it to Stadia. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9611855?p=privacy_settings&amp;amp;visit_id=637716624789453781-1844496392&amp;amp;rd=1#currentgame"&gt;A new support page&lt;/a&gt; confirms the feature is live in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6 &lt;/em&gt;on Stadia&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; so friends can join you without you having to dig into menus and issue an invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVkjAH"&gt;Google mentions the feature is only available in “select games,” and is disabled by default. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/stadia-join-game-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature is actually enabled by default, and we’ve confirmed it’s also been enabled on one of our Stadia accounts. The join without an invite feature is also available in the Stadia app for Android, and is available through the web version that runs on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8d0JX"&gt;Google has been gradually adding features to Stadia over the past two years since its launch, including a new 30-minute game trial for &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/details/e85d550899de407e996a8a2d9dfbc7efrcp1/sku/4db0c5af19c74032beb90d083dfb9431p?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month. The future of Stadia still looks more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;like a whitelabel service&lt;/a&gt; for game developers and other companies looking to stream games, and last month AT&amp;amp;T started offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;browser-based version of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;using Stadia’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government offers $10 million bounty for information on Colonial Pipeline hackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fuel Storage On Canvey Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJmTlyO1covQpVQ0AnQxuQw0VaU=/0x3:4579x3056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70098956/1332362213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Colonial Pipeline attack targeted key fuel pipelines, like these pipes seen in Canvey Island, in the UK. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPC0iY"&gt;In May, a ransomware attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;shut down a pipeline&lt;/a&gt; carrying 45 percent of the fuel used on the US East Coast. The Colonial Pipeline incident led to panic buying and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;heightened fears&lt;/a&gt; about the threat posed by simple hacks to national infrastructure. Now, the US State Department is &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/reward-offers-for-information-to-bring-darkside-ransomware-variant-co-conspirators-to-justice/"&gt;offering a bounty of up to $10 million&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who can supply the “identity or location” of the leaders of the group responsible — an outfit known as DarkSide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W1NvE"&gt;In addition to the $10 million bounty, the state department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction “of any individual conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a DarkSide variant ransomware incident.” What exactly that means isn’t clear. Is a “DarkSide variant ransomware incident” one that involves the group’s hacking tools? What if the software has been altered slightly? It seems deliberately ambiguous, allowing the State Department to cast as wide a net as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Afky6O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fighting ransomware with bounties&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UNxtZV"&gt;The offer is the latest example of the US using monetary rewards to try and fight serious cybercrime. These bounties are offered under the &lt;a href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/about-rfj/frequently-asked-questions.html"&gt;Rewards for Justice (RfJ) program&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally established in 1984 to target international terrorism. The US evidently thinks cybercriminals now warrant the same level of attention and, in &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the State Department began offering bounties of up to $10 million through RfJ for information on individuals who participate in “malicious cyber activities against US critical infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXuFUC"&gt;(For anyone interested, the State Department has a Tor-based tip line, accessible at he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion. This URL requires the use of a Tor browser and won’t work with ordinary browsers like Chrome or Firefox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsprAa"&gt;The ambiguous nature of the State Department’s latest bounty is related to the fluid nature of hacking groups. These outfits can dissolve and reform under different monikers and identities as easily as someone creating a new username, but they often use related methods and software that can be used to trace a common lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5PZzp"&gt;DarkSide, for example, ceased all activities after the Colonial Pipeline incident. The group seemed caught off-guard by the magnitude of the attack, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;issued a formal apology&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of what they did. But according to US cybersecurity experts, members of the group &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a"&gt;may have simply rebranded&lt;/a&gt; as an outfit named BlackMatter, which appeared on the scene weeks after DarkSide dropped off the radar, wielding similar weapons and tactics. Presumably, the state department’s bounty will apply to them, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter makes it easier to search tweets from specific accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OF4Q2DtfOnqfs_h9dlOFmc1HmNA=/0x0:848x565/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70098948/IMG_1632_crop.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search button appears on the top right of a user’s profile page on iOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LXvr0Q"&gt;Twitter has added a new search button on profile pages that makes it easier to search through tweets from a specific user. Social media consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1447556138145394692"&gt;Matt Navarra&lt;/a&gt; noted that the button had started appearing for a small number of users last month, but now &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/twitter-making-it-easier-dig-into-tweet-history-ios/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; that the feature has rolled out widely in the service’s iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk5RPM"&gt;Being able to limit a search to a single user’s tweets is not a new Twitter feature. You can achieve the same result by using the format “from:[Twitter handle] [search term]” in the regular Twitter search box. So, for example, if you wanted to search my (bad) tweets for every time I mentioned the word “keyboard,” you could tap the search icon in the app and enter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I0Idvj"&gt;from:jonporty keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0oT7Nf"&gt;The new button makes life just a bit easier. It could be helpful if, for example, you want to find an article you vaguely remember someone tweeting about months ago but can’t remember the specifics of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7zfX0"&gt;The new search button is a small example of the flurry of new features Twitter has been adding to its service in recent months. Just last week the platform rolled out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753072/twitter-super-follows-subscription-ios"&gt;iOS users globally to Super Follow Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they’re now able to pay for access to bonus content from creators on the platform. That same month, Twitter also started letting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;anyone host one of its an audio-only Space chatrooms&lt;/a&gt;. Other new features include its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF1SkN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwr2Dp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI releases new flagship Mavic drones — Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZ4JJvdA5RvBp2r2JTc8KCPwAwk=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70097389/DJI_Mavic_3___Forest_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BQd9yt"&gt;One of the most anticipated drone releases is finally out. Actually, it’s two drones. Today, DJI has released the Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN7LO3"&gt;There are a few big headline features shared between both of the new drones, but let’s start with the one reserved for the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine. The Cine model is capable of filming Apple ProRes 422 HQ footage at 5.1K up to 50FPS, and it has a built-in, but not user-replaceable, 1TB SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okX7Tn"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="DJI_Mavic_3_YTSHORT|104685" data-volume-uuid="6f17a3597" data-volume-id="104685" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-690" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLDbq"&gt;The cheaper $2,199 Mavic 3 doesn’t come with ProRes or a built-in SSD but shares the same dual-camera system powered by a 4/3 CMOS sensor. Both drones are capable of filming in 4K at up to 120fps and capturing 20MP photos. In addition to the main 24mm lens, there is also a hybrid zoom lens capable of 28x digital zoom. In focal length terms, that equates to 162mm at f/4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0DYLQwUh17DqMllJ_3cUjlErQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983162/DJI_Mavic_3___Canyon___Mountains_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both drones have the same camera module, except Cine version can shoot 5.1K ProRes video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4p362e"&gt;Both drones have batteries rated for 46 minutes of flight time, which is a significant upgrade over the Mavic 2’s 31-minute battery and even the Mavic Air 2s &amp;amp; 2S, which could fly for 34 and 31 minutes on one charge, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKiG1H"&gt;The two drones are successors to DJI’s Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom released in 2018, which also introduced the first Hasselblad camera to be used in DJI drones after it acquired a majority stake in said company in 2017. But since 2018, we haven’t seen much Hasselblad branding in DJI products — until today. And just like in 2018, DJI is including &lt;em&gt;Hasselblad Natural Color Solution&lt;/em&gt;, which promises incredibly natural colors straight out of its camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZEhyK"&gt;But if you don’t want the built-in color profile, the Mavic 3 is also capable of filming footage in 10-bit D-log for more control over color in post-processing. In addition to ProRes encoding, you can all shoot in standard H.264 and H.265 profiles, but there is no HDR video on this drone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1gPJbh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10844021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vg0o53"&gt;Aside from all the camera improvements, DJI has also upgraded its autonomous features for the Mavic 3. Just like its predecessor, the Mavic 3 also shares omnidirectional obstacle sensing, except the sensors are now capable of detecting objects even 200m (650 feet) away, compared to 20m (65 feet) before. I’ve always found the sensor to be a bit too sensitive, so I’m curious to find out how they act now while near objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzXary"&gt;But that extra reach does enable some new improvements — &lt;em&gt;Advanced RTH &lt;/em&gt;(return to home), APAS 5.0 and ActiveTrack 5.0. Advanced RTH helps the drone plan out a more intelligent route on its way back to the launching position. And the APAS 5.0 does exactly that, except when you’re the one operating the drone. ActiveTrack 5.0, which won’t be available on release, promises great improvement over tracking and following subjects. Such as the ability to fly in any direction while following a subject and taking advantage of visual sensors on the camera body to continue tracking subjects if they go out of frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzvNvrfevY_fTfZEVnI6t6fOvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986400/DJI_Mavic_3___KV_02__desert_standard_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;DJI’s updated ActiveTrack 5.0 promises better autonomous flying and filming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6oGHkZ"&gt;Both drones also come with updated versions of DJI’s proprietary transmission technology, OcuSync 3+, which promises 15km of range (in ideal conditions) and 1080p at 60fps live feed transmission to your smartphone or controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfZj2G"&gt;If you’re interested in buying this drone, there are three bundles to choose from. The standard version, which includes the drone, carrying strap, remote controller, charger, a set of extra propellers, and a joystick, will cost you $2,199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DonFRT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10846229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BMdw1T"&gt;The Fly More Combo adds two additional batteries, a charging hub, four sets of propellers, a carrying case that also transforms into a backpack, and a set of ND filters (ND4, ND8, ND16 and ND32). The Fly More Combo will cost you $2,999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIKe5i"&gt;And the final bundle is the Cine Premium Combo, which means you won’t be able to buy the Cine version of the Mavic 3 without spending more money on the accessories that come with it — including a completely brand new DJI RC Pro. It’s a remote controller similar to the DJI Smart Controller that features a bright built-in screen. The Cine Premium combo also includes an additional set of ND filters (ND64, ND128, ND256, ND512) that you won’t find in the Fly More Combo. Again, the Cine Premium Combo bundle will cost you $4,999. All three bundles are available to order starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypGQTc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go938h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
