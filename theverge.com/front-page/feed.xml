    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra might have a tiny rear-facing display as a treat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rzry1JyEJDhay7pYddsSyxQ1QF4=/233x0:2633x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810744/screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A YouTuber claims to have the unannounced Mi 11 Ultra featuring a 1-inch rear-facing screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ" target="_blank"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0lkk74"&gt;A YouTuber has posted a video featuring what he claims are two prototype Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra devices, suggesting the phone might have an unusual feature: a 1-inch rear-facing screen right next to the cameras. The video shows this small screen displaying what looks like an image of the phone’s home screen, only... you know, microscopic. A more practical application might be for selfies using the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIr9WI"&gt;The video, since taken down, comes from a little-known Filipino vlogger who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-11-ultra-leak-120x-zoom-secondary-screen/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; the device model number checks out, and certain details align with previous leaks. Other details from this alleged leak include 67W fast wireless charging, a 6.8-inch curved OLED with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, a 5,000mAh battery, and IP68 water and dust resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHZ7Z5MDhlVBwSfjD6KkPn5m6QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300240/cameras.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tech Buff PH&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device shows three cameras, including a periscope-style lens with 120x hybrid zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7iJtUE"&gt;The alleged devices include a huge camera bump with a 120x hybrid zoom camera, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a 50-megapixel main camera. If this phone is indeed the Mi 11 Ultra, then it looks like Xiaomi ditched the 2x telephoto lens on the previous model, offering just the longer periscope-style zoom lens instead. There’s also a 12mm ultrawide, which Tech Buff PH claims has a 48-megapixel sensor, upgraded from 12 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bseVcE"&gt;Xiaomi announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Chinese variant&lt;/a&gt; of the standard Mi 11 at the end of 2020, and more recently, it unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;international version&lt;/a&gt;. Both feature a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor offering 5G connectivity. With those versions announced, Xiaomi will likely follow with other variants such as the alleged Ultra version featured here. Whether this device will shape up to be the real deal remains to be seen, but it’s an interesting concept to consider in either case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s $329 RTX 3060 graphics card is launching on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHFJDDfAxVVuOMjFuruygt6xecM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810679/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1ooUb"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Nvidia was making a $329 RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, and today, the company announced that it will make its most affordable GPU in the RTX 3000 series available at retailers beginning on February 25th. Retailers will open orders for the RTX 3060 starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will not be creating a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060 graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fstpRG"&gt;Designed to succeed the aging GeForce GTX 1060 Pascal cards, the RTX 3060 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory. Like the other products featured in the RTX 3000 series, the RTX 3060 will also support DLSS and Nvidia’s suite of RTX applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qXPsa"&gt;With a new RTX 30 card coming later this month, we anticipate that the RTX 3060 GPU will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. These cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;have been difficult to purchase&lt;/a&gt; since last fall when the RTX 30 series first debuted. In January, Nvidia said it anticipates supply for its GPUs to both consumers and partners “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;will likely remain lean through Q1&lt;/a&gt;,” which doesn’t end until late April. To alleviate the short supply and sky-high prices, Nvidia confirmed yesterday that it plans to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;back its older RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches an augmented reality app to promote For All Mankind on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRlv6-X2STPR9kjJD-TEpNuZrJg=/167x0:2066x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810589/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wzhgrz"&gt;Apple is gearing up for the release of &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; season 2 on Apple TV Plus. It’s kicking things off with a new augmented reality app, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Ffor-all-mankind-time-capsule-a-new-augmented-reality-experience-based-on-the-apple-tv-space-drama-is-available-today-in-the-app-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22278780%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;, that looks to fill in the gap between the two seasons using AR artifacts from the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYaejE"&gt;The app itself is a fun promotional gimmick to help promote the second season of one of Apple’s higher-profile original shows. It’s the broader strategy at play that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-A2SPv3VJ5iEzKRt16P48rg6ZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300211/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.26_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JJNJeK"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple is interested in AR. The recurring AR demos at the last several iPhone and iPad product announcements, the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185200/apple-ipad-pro-lidar-sensor-ar-hardware-solution-software-apps-augmented-reality"&gt;AR-focused LIDAR cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro devices&lt;/a&gt;, and the persistent rumors of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;pending VR / AR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are all clear evidence of that. And Apple has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/apple-plans-augmented-reality-content-to-boost-tv-video-service?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on the tie-in app for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcDepD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7Jd0Y0"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule is one of the first indications of Apple tying all of its hardware, content, and service ambitions together. It’s an augmented reality app downloaded from the App Store that prompts users to subscribe to Apple TV Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, with additional content for LIDAR-equipped Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ChQU3"&gt;It’s the kind of cross-promotional content that spans Apple’s wide array of businesses. It could also offer a glimpse at the kind of integrated hardware, software, and service bundle that Apple could be considering for any future AR devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex and the City is now available in HD for the first time on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAnpitTvj8WmQx7KLbDDvFRfW-8=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810387/cq5dam.web.768.432.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v5P22e"&gt;A newly remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; is now available to stream on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced on Friday. Thanks to the remaster, you can watch the hit show in a high-definition 16:9 aspect ratio for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enIPUF"&gt;“The series was originally shot on film and mastered in standard definition as high definition capabilities were unavailable at the time of filming,” &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/media-release/newly-remastered-hd-version-sex-and-city-now-available-hbo-max"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the past year, the series was updated from scratch as film negatives from the show were meticulously scanned at 4K to create HD masters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIPndy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQN-uyEyuwY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JfZzgH"&gt;The new HD remasters arrive ahead of a “new chapter” of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; coming to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, called “And Just Like That...” Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis are set to reprise their roles as Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, but playing the characters in their 50s. WarnerMedia has already given the series a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/sarah-jessica-parker-cynthia-nixon-and-kristin-davis-star-max-original-series-and?language_content_entity=en"&gt;10-episode order&lt;/a&gt; and says it will begin production in New York City this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is available now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvgRQTxM0NLQWTBSTeifLDgYgTM=/486x0:5736x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808878/SM3DW_Lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo Switch Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwoMeU"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, several retailers have a Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition Switch game console available for purchase. You can buy one right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Red-Blue/dp/B08M8YQMH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732041273955221131" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-and-blue-edition%2F11114028.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-38-blue-edition%2F-%2FA-82242753%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGb5kj"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;-themed Switch released last year&lt;/a&gt;, this limited-edition console stands out from other models, with the entire Switch and its accompanying accessories based on the outfit typically worn by the mustached plumber. Retailing for $300, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AvudIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10338949"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HC5Y2"&gt;Additionally, for $300, the Mario-themed Switch also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case that includes various symbols associated with the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; franchise at no additional cost. The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;, which includes two more hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg2C5x"&gt;If you are planning to buy this console, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the device does not include a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;, despite both products having the same release date. Secondly, these limited-edition Nintendo Switch consoles tend to sell out quickly, and there’s no telling if and when it will be restocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xSUolY"&gt;The title of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftech%2Fannals-of-technology%2Finside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22280003%2Ffacebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-feature-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new feature in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;written by law professor Kate Klonick, implies that the answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. The story is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGpKKX"&gt;The feature is called “Inside the making of Facebook’s Supreme Court,” and it’s an unprecedentedly detailed look at the Facebook Oversight Board, a Facebook-funded semi-independent panel that can overrule Facebook takedown decisions. The Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, and it issued its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first decisions in January&lt;/a&gt;, saying Facebook had made the wrong call on four removed posts. In the coming months, it will make its highest-profile decision to date: whether Facebook should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;restore the account&lt;/a&gt; of former president Donald Trump. But as Klonick lays out, its actual power is complex and contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5dFK6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees worried a powerful court could accidentally kill Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hHWm0"&gt;Klonick writes candidly about months of heated debate over how the Oversight Board should function. Internally, Facebook employees worried that if the board could write policy, it might make a decision that destroyed Facebook: what if, one person speculated, it told Facebook to get rid of the News Feed? Externally, it faced pressure from conservative politicians. One group reportedly asked Facebook to add Trump’s children to the Oversight Board, and when the members were announced, Trump apparently called CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rail against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P2nXp"&gt;But the biggest power struggle in the story isn’t any individual policy decision; it’s the protracted attempt to legitimize a Facebook quasi-government. Interestingly, Klonick &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Klonick/status/1360257727671468032"&gt;mentioned on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook “hated” the Supreme Court framing — even if “that’s how the public thinks of it.” But Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17187974/mark-zuckerberg-community-content-removal-appeal-vox-interview"&gt;mused about a system&lt;/a&gt; “like a Supreme Court” in 2018, and Klonick notes that the board’s charter was referred to internally as a “constitution.” In perhaps the story’s funniest detail, members “used pens topped with a feather, to evoke the quills used by the Founding Fathers.” (Sadly, “topped” implies they wouldn’t commit to &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; quill pens.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50iwJQ"&gt;Parts of the story’s framing have drawn objections from some critics and legal scholars. After all, the board doesn’t have formal legal power — it exists because Facebook is voluntarily abiding by its rules. “Facebook and others have been appropriating legal/civic language and frameworks from the beginning. It has always, ALWAYS been about declaring legitimacy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwherrman/status/1360247786197901313"&gt;tweeted &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; John Herrman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OrNT79"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Should we use the language of government for Facebook?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPc2EG"&gt;That legitimacy comes partly from Facebook’s ability to pull critics into its orbit. Knight First Amendment Institute director Jameel Jaffer tells Klonick he turned down a spot on the board, and he’s anxious that Facebook is “co-opting” people who might push for change from the outside. Journalist and professor Zeynep Tufekci &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1360249282645929985"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; the Oversight Board could meaningfully improve moderation, but “it is being rolled out BY FACEBOOK as part of a PR push, with Facebook trying to elbow it into a position where we treat it as a ‘Supreme Court’ despite the obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKAsYR"&gt;The Trump case will put the Oversight Board and its limitations in the spotlight. (The Knight Institute has asked it to delay the decision &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/facebook-oversight-board-should-delay-ruling-on-suspension-of-trump-knight-institute-says"&gt;for an outside review&lt;/a&gt;.) And it will do so as Congress looks at whether to regulate Facebook the old-fashioned way — with a government the social giant &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; build.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Notion was having technical issues, so I have no idea what my schedule is today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3IReCnAx8bGX_0yMHSZ0T1y1mc=/0x62:1000x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810108/akrales_180824_2908_0071_squ.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This shows what Notion looks like when it is working | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBKAre"&gt;Online organization app Notion was experiencing technical difficulties this morning and students, project managers, and other users — like me — who rely on it to organize our calendars are having minor freak-outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20MJIG"&gt;The company said in a tweet around 8:30AM ET that it was “experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users.” The company didn’t provide much additional detail, but some speculated that it may have to do with Notion’s web address: notion.so. The “so” suffix is the domain for the country of Somalia, and a deleted tweet from Notion asked if anyone knew people in Somalia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iC4zji"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users. We are actively looking into this issue.&lt;/p&gt;— Notion Status (@NotionStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360220589743480838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuDIdy"&gt;The app is mainly used as a workplace collaboration tool, but it has become popular among casual users — including teens on TikTok, who use it to organize their class schedules. Users complaining about not being able to access Notion on Friday morning suggested now might be the time for the company, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/"&gt;valued at $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, to make offline access a priority in future versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="513mQB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok teens’ latest passion is enterprise software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3TqG3z"&gt;Around 11AM ET, the company said the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360257098781659137?s=20"&gt;DNS issue was resolved&lt;/a&gt; and users should begin to see service restored. The company confirmed it was putting protections in place to prevent future issues in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tRBvd6"&gt;The reason for the downtime this morning was a very unusual DNS issue that occurred at the registry operator level. Our engineers jumped on it immediately and resolved the issue - we’re back up now. We’re in touch with the registry operator and registrar putting protocols in place so that we can avoid this type of incident from repeating in the future. This was a very rare chain of events to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLnDQ"&gt;So far my Notion page is still down, so if I’m late to a Zoom meeting today, sorry boss, I tried. I mean, what are we supposed to do, write down our to-do lists on paper like olden times? (I do that, too, tbh. I have organization issues). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOx9X7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTHLcX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9Ulx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this article about how we got duped into cooking with gas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue natural gas flame on a domestic cooker gas hob." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zAcZu8JJGaQumdYHygC_AA95qxo=/0x0:4689x3126/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809927/971550326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue natural gas flame on a domestic cooker gas hob. | Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl00lP"&gt;I spend a lot of time fretting about how my home might be slowly killing me. As an environmental journalist, it’s part of my job to be hyper aware of any toxins that could be lurking around me. Lately, my gas stove has me especially worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFfwQe"&gt;I didn’t think much about the hazards of cooking with a gas stove in the past because, like a lot of people, I’ve been bombarded with ad campaigns from the natural gas industry since I was a kid. &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/how-the-fossil-fuel-industry-convinced-americans-to-love-gas-stoves/"&gt;Recent reporting from Rebecca Leber at &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposes how insidious that influence has been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tIpZTA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gas stoves actually unleash indoor air pollutants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fj2aqN"&gt;Gas stoves actually &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/5/7/21247602/gas-stove-cooking-indoor-air-pollution-health-risks"&gt;unleash indoor air pollutants&lt;/a&gt; like soot, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Beyond that, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like natural gas drive climate change. That’s why there’s a push now to electrify homes; electric stoves can run on clean energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esi8pN"&gt;The history of how “cooking with gas” campaigns have made a source of fossil fuel combustion in our homes seem completely innocuous gets pretty ridiculous. Leber dug up a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJRQo5aawho&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;rap video&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 that spends an entire four minutes hyping up gas stoves in rhyme. “Gas is so hot, it’s not on when it’s off / it’s the only way to cook, that’s what I was taught,” the rap starts off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvkA7h"&gt;Fast forward to about two minutes into the video, however, and there’s a disclaimer in the lyrics that my colleague Sean O’Kane noticed: “Safe cooking begins with range location / avoid main traffic paths and also isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QTSseV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;gas groups pay social media influencers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="izOhnj"&gt;Today, gas groups pay social media influencers to advertise the supposed benefits of cooking with the fossil fuel, &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/06/gas-industry-influencers-stoves/"&gt;Leber reports&lt;/a&gt;. A public relations representative even posed as a resident in a neighborhood to stir up backlash against building codes that would discourage natural gas hookups in new construction, she writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXr4f8"&gt;You have to read the truly bizarre and alarming history of gas that Leber traces in her article. With many of us spending more time working and hanging out at home during the pandemic, it’s more important than ever to be aware of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325753/spending-time-at-home-health-effects-pandemic-great-indoors"&gt;what we’re exposed to inside&lt;/a&gt; the place that’s supposed to be our refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ONORB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q8HrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon sues to block state investigation of New York warehouse labor fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLZDiIu9XPDmy1dgbgLeiIX3iKE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809816/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PC8hRT"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299769/amazon_vs_letitia_james.pdf"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the New York state attorney general’s office as a preemptive effort to prevent legal action over the company’s handling of COVID-19 conditions at a Staten Island warehouse last spring. Amazon is seeking an injunction preventing the attorney general’s office from trying to exercise “regulatory authority over workplace safety responses to COVID-19 and claims of retaliation against workers who protest working conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse said last March that they didn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;necessary protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; and were not informed when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;co-workers tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Chris Smalls, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organized a walkout in March&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGfROt"&gt;The company said Smalls was fired for violating social distancing guidelines, not for protesting. New York &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/ag-james-statement-firing-amazon-worker-who-organized-walkout"&gt;Attorney General Letitia James called Smalls’ firing “disgraceful”&lt;/a&gt; at the time and pushed for an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. In April, five US Senators &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/8/21214117/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-senator-booker-chris-smalls-senators-letter"&gt;wrote a letter to Amazon&lt;/a&gt; questioning its handling of Smalls’ dismissal. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the workers “were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions” but for violating safety policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hvBXA"&gt;In its complaint, Amazon argues that James’ office “lacks the legal authority” to demand legal remedies such as surrender of profit, instead claiming that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has jurisdiction over any workplace safety claims brought under New York labor laws. In addition, the lawsuit claims, the National Labor Relations Board would have authority over Smalls and other employees’ claims of retaliation, not the attorney general’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqrn9T"&gt;The lawsuit claims the Staten Island facility passed an inspection by the sheriff’s office of New York on March 30th, which found that the workers’ safety complaints were “baseless.” The company claims it conducts regular temperature checks, provides staggered shifts, and promotes social distancing at the warehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jmk35"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, James called Amazon’s lawsuit “nothing more than a sad attempt to distract from the facts and shirk accountability for its failures to protect hardworking employees from a deadly virus.” She added her office would “not be initimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XC52Fl"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said Friday that since its complaint was very detailed it was not providing further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xK8C9t"&gt;During its second-quarter earnings announcement last April, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243112/amazon-q1-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;pledged to spend $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the impact of COVID-19, but complaints from warehouse and other Amazon workers continued; in May, a French court shut down Amazon’s warehouses in the country after labor unions said the company wasn’t doing enough to protect them from the virus. And in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246284/amazon-vp-resign-whistleblower-firings-warehouse-workers"&gt;a prominent Amazon vice president resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the company, accusing it in a scathing public blog post of ignoring the “the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqgpG8"&gt;Amazon said in its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this month that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;full-year 2020 net sales were up 38 percent&lt;/a&gt; to $386.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon — especially from OnePlus — but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best budget phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hEmpY9"&gt;Best midrange Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eI71VU"&gt;Last year’s Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a Goldilocks phone. It is much more capable and powerful than budget phones like the Pixel 4A 5G, but it still costs significantly less than the newest flagship phones. Even though it came out in October 2020, it still is a completely competent device with an excellent screen, good cameras, and fairly good battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5nZhS"&gt;The “FE” in the name stands for “Fan Edition,” but the reality is that this is a phone for anybody, not just Samsung fans. To bring the price down from its flagships, Samsung changed the screen resolution to 1080p and simplified the build materials — it has a plastic back. Don’t let that last detail throw you, though, as the plastic back feels quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65JwyR"&gt;The successor to the S20 FE really is the “flagship” Galaxy S21, which has essentially the same camera system as this phone. As we’ve noted with most Samsung phones, the whole game is whether or not you can find a good deal. If the S21 and S20 FE are about the same price, go with the S21. If you can find a great price on the S20 FE, it’ll do right by you as a very solid Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: at $2,000, the Fold 2 is literally twice as expensive as other high-end phones. You’re paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
