    <title>Big tech companies including Intel, Nvidia, and Cisco were all infected during the SolarWinds hack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v8gXS1"&gt;Last week, news broke that IT management company SolarWinds had been hacked, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/19/22190371/pompeo-russia-hack-us-agencies-solarwinds-microsoft"&gt;possibly by the Russian government&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security departments have been affected — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html"&gt;two of which may have had emails stolen&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the hack. Other government agencies and many companies are investigating due to SolarWinds’ extensive client list. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;is now reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/solarwinds-hack-victims-from-tech-companies-to-a-hospital-and-university-11608548402?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;some big tech companies have been infected, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pN0u9m"&gt;Cisco, Intel, Nvidia, Belkin, and VMware have all had computers on their networks infected with the malware. There could be far more: SolarWinds had stated that “fewer than 18,000” companies were impacted, as if that number is supposed to be reassuring, and it even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;attempted to hide the list of clients&lt;/a&gt; who used the infected software. Today’s news takes some of SolarWinds’ big-name clients from “possibly affected’’ to “confirmed affected.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gWH3w"&gt;At the moment, the big tech companies have the same story, boiling down to “we’re investigating, but we don’t think this has impacted us.” But as we’ve repeatedly learned in instances like the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dea73efc01594839957c3c9a6c962b8a"&gt;2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee’s email&lt;/a&gt;, it can take a long time for the impacts of a hack to be fully realized. Once hackers are inside a system, it can also be difficult to tell if they’re fully gone. As &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hacking-russia-bafff5557a8941aa1a5ef239d36c4e28"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; report explains&lt;/a&gt;, it can be difficult to fully trust a network after a hacker has been inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKAAVx"&gt;In this case, investigators have a lot of data to look back through: the hack is still ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;and has been for months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hhUi8"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that investigators found &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-second-hacking-group-has-targeted-solarwinds-systems/"&gt;another hacking group&lt;/a&gt; that had broken into SolarWinds using a similar exploit. This attack, dubbed Supernova, was at first thought to be part of the main attack (aka Sunburst), but investigators now think it was executed by a second, less sophisticated group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HA28"&gt;There are all sorts of reasons why a hacking group might want to get into a big tech company’s systems, including access to future product plans or employee and customer information that could be sold or held for ransom, assuming they actually went looking for that info. But it’s also possible these companies were only collateral damage as these hacking groups went after government agencies, ones that happened to share the same SolarWinds-provided IT management systems. At the moment, it doesn’t seem like any of these companies are particularly worried. Compare that to the US government’s computer security organization, which announced that &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network"&gt;every federal agency should power down&lt;/a&gt; its SolarWinds systems immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants to build its first car in 2024, Reuters says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhU4W60hCQ5McMPuRNpxKJYdzMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562849/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCaIgR"&gt;Apple once again appears to be seriously looking at making a car. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is pursuing production of a passenger vehicle by 2024 as well as the creation of self-driving systems and a “breakthrough battery technology.” The report is vague on how it all comes together — it’s not clear that all of this tech is going into the first passenger vehicle Apple hopes to make — but it indicates that Apple is considering vehicle production, after previously shutting down plans to make a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7fxC"&gt;There have been rumors of Apple developing a car going &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"&gt;back to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2016, the project was scaled down significantly, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;development of a full car being scrapped&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s team refocusing on providing software that could be licensed out to car manufacturers, according to reports at the time. Around 200 people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;were laid off&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s car team just last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZo6Yh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of vague details still, including whether this will actually happen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qhcXN"&gt;Now it seems that Apple has renewed its focus on building an actual vehicle — though there’s a lot of uncertainty on when (and even if) it will happen. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says 2024 is the production goal for an Apple-made passenger vehicle, though it could be pushed back “into 2025 or beyond” because of pandemic-related delays. There is also still a chance Apple could scale its efforts back to just autonomous driving tech, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHKZEu"&gt;The report says that Apple is relying on third parties to provide some components of its self-driving tech, including its LIDAR systems. Apple’s battery technology reportedly relies on a “monocell” design that allows more capacity to be fit into the overall battery unit by not dividing it up into discrete cells. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that it could allow for “a potentially longer range” and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAvXzX"&gt;Apple declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GuZwn"&gt;If Apple is planning to manufacture a self-driving car, it may also face regulatory hurdles before it can hit the road. There are no true self-driving vehicles available today, though some cars, like those from Tesla, offer a degree of advanced driver assistance driving in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrVaW"&gt;Earlier this month, Apple handed control of its self-driving car project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;over to John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s head of AI. Giannandrea was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;brought on board&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 to work on Siri, after previously working at Google as head of search and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzA2Mv"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/20/sketchy-report-says-apple-car-coming-2021/"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;em&gt;Economic Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in Taiwan, said that an Apple-made car could be released as soon as 2021 in what would be a stunningly ambitious timeframe if true. Back in 2018, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the launch of a car between 2023 and 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/14/ming-chi-kuo-apple-car-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, though, the impression has been that Apple was focused on self-driving technology for the past several years, rather than production of an actual Apple-branded vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy Chromebook 2 is oranger than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jhDht9-t5s5BVe0ElpEhEM2PEa8=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562779/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgEl32"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Chromebook 2 has been revealed in a new leak, showing off the return of the company’s unique bright orange coloring in an otherwise similar-looking design, &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122"&gt;via Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLhkdU"&gt;There are some visible changes to the new model, including minor adjustments to the port layout and the extension of Samsung’s application of the orange color. The keyboard on the second-generation model has been made a more neutral black, even as the orange hue has extended to the sides of the laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uSps3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Chromebook review: beautiful to a fault","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R7n8Gr"&gt;But any more substantial changes will likely be found in the internal specs, which presumably will see some sort of improvement from last year’s model — especially considering that there are new 11th Gen Intel laptop chips out. Combining the improved battery life and graphics performance from those chips with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;already good-looking Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; sounds like an intriguing possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT9x7D"&gt;The original Galaxy Chromebook was a premium device, with a design — and price tag — to match. But in her review, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chen was disappointed with the poor battery life and cooling — areas Samsung will hopefully be improving on in this newly leaked model. CES 2021 is right around the corner, so odds are that we’ll get an official reveal from Samsung in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley’s jam-packed 1.5 update reminds us why it’s our forever game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdpxVihGwv5XufbehERSDZaQwn8=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562581/StardewScreenshot_1.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XABTSp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;is an idyllic digital space to escape to after a long year — and thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-out-now-on-pc/"&gt;1.5 update available today on PC&lt;/a&gt;, you can now bring friends and family along to your farm with local split-screen co-op. The &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/30/17304754/stardew-valley-multiplayer-mode-co-op"&gt;multiplayer update&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of years back made it possible to play and share farms online, but this local co-op addition lets you do the same with the people you actually live with, even if they don’t have their own copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pTGhk"&gt;You can add the ability for local co-op by having Robin the Carpenter build cabins on your farm, or if you’re starting from scratch, you can select to have the cabins already built when you make a new game. Once the cabins are built, you can start local co-op for up to three other people from game menu. The 1.5 update also adds a new “Beach Farm” map that includes sandy soil that can clog up sprinklers, and “Advanced Game Options” in character creation that let you randomize bundles in the Community Center and rewards in the Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4p17ZhPA7IRI-I7vy26njscNq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188656/StardewValley_NewGameOptions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New game options in the 1.5 update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BK148w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-full-changelog/"&gt;full release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the update contain even more surprises. The notable ones that had &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;fans at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; excited to return to the game are the ability to sit on chairs (yes, really), a change to the social tab in-game so that it shows you who you’ve already talked to each day, and a new coffee maker item that brews a fresh cup every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5CQN"&gt;The special thing about &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s so full of features and so consistently updated that every little change could mean something to someone. Having a routine that you follow each day in-game makes it easier to appreciate the little things that streamline those processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFl46C"&gt;It was an updated social tab and a coffee maker in this update, but it could just as easily be something else next time. No matter how small the feature or fix, &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;updates are a reminder that the game is always exciting and surprising to return to. It’s a comfortable “forever” game in a normal year and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178215/games-quarantine-coronavirus-play-pokemon-shield-sword-stardew-valley-pubg-persona"&gt;nice cure to pandemic blues if you need it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5562PE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s 1.5 Update is available now on PC. The update will come to consoles in early 2021 and mobile phones sometime after that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweeping new copyright measures poised to pass in spending bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelosi And Schumer Speak To Press On COVID-19 Stimulus And Omnibus Spending Bills" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cGBrmxDUNkC2v0ZKWwsBJwgQPw=/0x0:4100x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562461/1292321546.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXILH2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/floor/Default.aspx?date=2020-12-21"&gt;congressional leaders unveiled&lt;/a&gt; their massive spending and coronavirus relief measure, including a handful of controversial copyright measures civil liberties activists fear could penalize internet users for everyday online behavior. Congress is expected to vote on the package as early as Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC24OH"&gt;Congress’ $2.3 trillion spending and relief package includes controversial measures previously introduced as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20703742/case-act-copyright-office-online-designers-congress-bill"&gt;the CASE Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Trademark Modernization Act, and a &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/tillis-releases-text-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations"&gt;felony streaming proposal&lt;/a&gt; — all significantly expanding the rights and powers of intellectual property owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGcuTF"&gt;Most controversially, the CASE Act would create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca"&gt;a quasi-judicial tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of “Copyright Claims Officers” who would work to resolve infringement claims. As outlined in the bill, copyright holders could be awarded up to $30,000 if they find their creative work being shared online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V89GY0"&gt;Proponents of the CASE Act, like the Copyright Alliance, argue that the bill would make it easier for independent artists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca"&gt;to bring about copyright claims&lt;/a&gt; without having to endure the lengthy and expensive federal courts process. Still, critics of the bill, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future, argue that the CASE Act could fine ordinary internet users for engaging in everyday online behavior like sharing memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Cr4GB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The CASE Act is a terribly written law that will threaten ordinary Internet users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pSfSE"&gt;“The CASE Act is a terribly written law that will threaten ordinary Internet users with huge fines for everyday online activity. It’s absurd that lawmakers included these provisions in a must-pass spending bill,” Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, said in a statement Monday. “We’re facing a massive eviction crisis and millions are unemployed due to the pandemic, but Congressional leaders could only muster $600 stimulus checks for COVID relief, but managed to cram in handouts for content companies like Disney?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSupEh"&gt;The multitrillion-dollar package also includes a provision authored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) that would allow the Justice Department to charge businesses for felony copyright infringement if they intentionally stream copyrighted material online. The &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-year-end-parting-shots-at-big-tech-e26aede2-6566-49dd-94e6-3301e25904ca.html"&gt;Trademark Modernization Act&lt;/a&gt; would allow third parties to request the Patent Office to reject trademark applications in an effort to combat “trademark trolls” who make money off of trademarks they never planned to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3LuC9"&gt;As congressional leaders have worked to finalize this package over the last few weeks, a coalition of tech trade groups and advocacy organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Internet Association urged lawmakers to refuse inclusion of these measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li616T"&gt;These groups claimed that the proposals could “have negative impacts on small- and medium-sized businesses, creators, libraries and their patrons, students, teachers, educational institutions, religious institutions, fan communities, internet users, and free expression,” in a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/amp/copyright-provisions-in-spending-bill-2649260098"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoOnTy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbeSG0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slavery and overfishing on the high seas can’t hide from these researchers</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish are seen after being unloaded from a boat at the port in Songkhla on February 2, 2016. Around 100 people have been arrested by authorities in a recent crackdown on abuses involving Thailand’s multi-billion dollar seafood industry. The deep-rooted problem caused the huge global brand, Nestle in 2015 to admit that it had discovered clear evidence of slavery at sea in parts of the Thai supply chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paula Bronstein / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPTCzS"&gt;A tracking system designed to help ships avoid crashing into each other has become an important tool for spotting bad behavior on the high seas. Researchers can now put a spotlight on corporations that dominate fishing in unregulated international waters where it’s easier to get away with overfishing. And it’s giving us a better idea of how widespread slave labor could be on fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGwzLM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8VutY"&gt;Two recently published papers use this technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), to make high-seas fishing a little less mysterious. The first study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt; on December 18th, traces the origins of thousands of high-seas fishing vessels back to big-time corporations that keep store shelves stocked with seafood. Other researchers use AIS to reveal telltale markers of forced labor on fishing boats, which were published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;). That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlqfRq"&gt;The technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), has actually been around for about two decades. Basically, vessels carry around a box that sends out radio signals that anyone else can pick up on. Those radio signals share information about the ship, an identifying number, and other things like its size, course, and speed. That’s supposed to help vessels spot each other so they don’t get in each other’s way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZIHS6"&gt;Satellites can pick up on those radio signals, too, giving researchers a new set of eyes on the vast high seas — international waters that make up almost two-thirds of the world’s oceans. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7219261/global-fishing-watch-map-tracks-illegal-fishing-across-the-globe"&gt;In 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Google and environmental nonprofit organizations Oceana and SkyTruth launched Global Fishing Watch, an initiative to track fishing vessels around the world as a way to potentially prevent and hold vessels accountable for abusive practices. Global Fishing Watch, which is now its own nonprofit, uses AIS and smaller national vessel tracking systems to create a near-real time map tracing the movement of about 60,000 commercial fishing boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWX999"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game-changer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ubRZh"&gt;That was a game-changer for Jennifer Jacquet, an associate professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies. She turned to Global Fishing Watch to identify for the first time seafood companies that own vessels fishing on the high seas. “Just in the course of my project, new technology enabled the research in a way that wasn’t there when the project began,” Jacquet tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Her team put together a list of the top 10 corporate actors in high-sea fishing in 2018, which includes Dongwon Group, which owns the popular tuna brand StarKist.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwoFo"&gt;“There are few laws and regulations that apply to the high seas, and that is being used by these companies to do whatever they want,” says Daniel Pauly, an acclaimed marine biologist who has documented the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419307644"&gt;demise of fish&lt;/a&gt; populations around the world. He has pushed for a &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-global-ban-on-fishing-on-the-high-seas-the-time-is-now#:~:text=the%20High%20Seas%3F-,The%20Time%20Is%20Now,of%20the%20fishing%20industry%20itself."&gt;complete ban&lt;/a&gt; on fishing on the high seas. (Pauly is on the board of directors for Oceana but was not involved in Jacquet’s study.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgMu14"&gt;Modern-day slavery is another problem on the high seas. Up to 26 percent of 16,000 industrial fishing vessels were likely to use forced labor, the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; study published today found. As many as 100,000 people are estimated to work on those ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUjwYn"&gt;The study authors used AIS data from 2012 to 2018 to study the behavior of vessels that had already been documented using slavery. That allowed them to see how those ships behaved differently from other vessels: they stay away from ports and spend a lot more time on the high seas, for example. The researchers used that information to build a computer model that can identify vessels showing behaviors that suggest that they might also rely on forced labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQfVBv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It could not have been done five years ago.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jkDJWt"&gt;“This research, this paper, it could not have been done five years ago,” says Gavin McDonald, lead author of that study. “There would have just been no way to track this many vessels at a global scale without Global Fishing Watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BM2hL"&gt;There’s still a lot of elbow grease that goes into turning the data from AIS into research that can have an impact on how responsibly the fishing industry operates. Data scientists at Global Fishing Watch had tried to automate this process in the past, but scraping the internet couldn’t get the same results. “You end up with one level, but you actually need to dig deeper,” says Nate Miller, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch who was a co-author with Jacquet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWYz8E"&gt;Jacquet and Miller’s team for this project did just that. One of their colleagues found that several high-seas fishing vessels shared the same address, even though they listed different owners. She searched for the address on Google Maps, zoomed in to see the sign on the building, and tied all those ships to Pacific Fishing &amp;amp; Supply based in Hawaii. It fulfilled one of Jacquet’s hopes for this study, which was to identify new players on the high seas since a lot of the spotlight so far had been on Asia-based companies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eEUx4M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7tNg0"&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act. The Walmart Foundation funded McDonald’s study after a 2015 investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/-sp-migrant-workers-new-life-enslaved-thai-fishing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/29784df39a66431a83e7c4ba2d2fcaaa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Walmart sold shrimp tied to slave labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrWVGj"&gt;If the high seas aren’t so lawless in the future, we may have researchers like these to thank. Their work could inform a new treaty being negotiated by the United Nations. If it comes to fruition next year, it could establish protected areas in the high seas to safeguard marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdBPJ6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxaPHG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile won’t claim it has a more reliable 5G network following ad board decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/931zRO0Gh-AIwkcC0fag7OjUwyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562292/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWEAvQ"&gt;T-Mobile has been asked to stop advertising its 5G network as more reliable than the competition by the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which investigated T-Mobile’s claims made primarily in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F405228998&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F21%2F22193839%2Ftmobile-5g-reliability-claims-verizon-competition-nad#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad featuring celebrity scientist Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; after complaints from Verizon earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koZpLU"&gt;But the NARB also says T-Mobile shouldn’t have to mention the speed of its network when broadly discussing coverage superiority in future ads. T-Mobile has said it will comply with the recommendation. But it cast the recommendations as a partial win in a statement saying it “appreciates that the panel agreed that T-Mobile can continue to advertise its superior 5G coverage without qualification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2X7Y2"&gt;T-Mobile’s compliance is notable because telecom giants don’t have to follow the recommendations offered by the NARB, which, as a self-regulatory body under the umbrella of a nonprofit organization, has no governmental regulatory power. For instance, AT&amp;amp;T flatly ignored a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;request it stop using its misleading “5G E” logo&lt;/a&gt; to reference a superior form of 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m4kXop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile was using Bill Nye to tout its 5G networks as more reliable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TTIJbG"&gt;Today’s decision from the NARB breaks partly with the recommendation from the National Advertising Division (NAD), the other half of the self-regulatory body that oversees telecom advertising in the US. (The NARB is the appellate division, designed to settle disputes that arise when a company appeals a recommendation, as T-Mobile did.) The NAD &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/t-mobile-advised-to-stop-claims-about-5g-reliability"&gt;ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that T-Mobile should have to disclose the speed of its network when claiming its 5G network offers superior reliability. T-Mobile appealed, kicking the decision to the NARB and resulting in a slightly more favorable outcome for T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aewelk"&gt;The video in question, one of a few starring Nye after he was hired by T-Mobile to be a king of 5G spokesman for the brand, features claims from Nye that Verizon’s 5G coverage, because it’s based on mmWave technology, has abysmal range equivalent to about the size of a bus stop. T-Mobile, because it was using much slower but more reliable low-band 5G, said its network had more reliable coverage while also making claims about superior reliability when compared to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqHc8g"&gt;“Other carriers have 5G signals that drop if you move two feet. That’s because their 5G is based around millimeter wave, otherwise known as high band. For instance this is how far 5G reaches with our carriers,” Nye says in the video, showing a small red circle around an outdoor bus stop filled with mannequins. Nye then shows how moving the arm of one of the mannequins holding a smartphone from within the red circle to outside it would switch coverage from 5G to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6en6Ft"&gt;The NARB says T-Mobile should “discontinue claims and an accompanying demonstration that imply that other carriers’ 5G coverage is so limited in any area as to cover only the space taken up by a single bench.” The board also recommended T-Mobile “discontinue claims that imply that its 5G service is generally available in locations that have traditionally been challenging for cellular service” unless it’s willing to say what speeds it can achieve in those locations. Lastly, T-Mobile can’t imply that its 5G coverage is more reliable than 4G coverage, either its own or that of competitors’ networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Yahy7"&gt;Here’s a more in-depth explanation from the NARB as to how it came to the conclusion that T-Mobile’s claims were misleading: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zYegPw"&gt;The NARB panel determined that T-Mobile’s express reliability assertions would be understood as comparing its 5G network to 4G networks, and that this message cannot be supported based on coverage, as T-Mobile’s 5G network does not equal or surpass its own 4G coverage or that of competitors. Further, the panel concluded that, in context, the claim that T-Mobile’s low-band 5G signal is more reliable than competing 5G signals should be evaluated with at least some insight concerning network performance beyond coverage. Because T-Mobile offered no such support for its 5G network reliability claims, parity or otherwise, the panel recommended that T-Mobile’s 5G reliability claims be discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSteVE"&gt;Much of this is semantics-based arguing that arises as a result of just how messy and confusing the 5G rollout in the US has been. Because 5G has been distributed across different wireless bands, each with its own trade-offs between coverage and speed, the major US telecoms have gone to great lengths to cast their own networks as superior to the competition. This often coincides with the same ads trying to mask the complexity of what type of 5G is being delivered and just how materially different from 4G it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwUWP"&gt;This has led to quite a few advertising disputes between the major telecoms, with T-Mobile and Verizon sniping at one another in ads and in complaints to bodies like the NAD / NARB. By the time most consumers are actually using 5G, which requires they have a newer phone and live in an area with reliable coverage, most of these pointless ad squabbles will likely have been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvLFiN"&gt;But that won’t stop these corporations from nitpicking one another’s advertising spots for any little discrepancy they can find, nor will it stop those same companies from complaining about inaccuracies from probably peddling one of their own in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civil rights groups move to block expansion of facial recognition in airports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlVLf6TwX4b3-NdL-Il6OICYKRI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561466/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNcmW4"&gt;A coalition of civil rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union have &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/cbps-plan-to-expand-face-surveillance-at-airports-is-a-civil-liberties-disaster-in-the-making/"&gt;filed an objection&lt;/a&gt; to the proposed expansion of Customs and Border Protections facial recognition at land and sea ports. The National Immigration Law Center, Fight for the Future, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are also participating in the motion, alongside twelve others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8N6QX"&gt;Filed in November, CBP’s proposed rule would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188526/airport-facial-recognition-us-customs-biometric-exit-expansion"&gt;expand the biometric exit system&lt;/a&gt;, authorizing the collection of facial images from any non-citizen entering the country. But in a filing on Monday, the final day of the comment period, the coalition argued that those measures are too extreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJAsA4"&gt;“CBP’s proposed use of face surveillance at airports, sea ports, and the land border would put the United States on an extraordinarily dangerous path toward the normalization of this surveillance,” said Ashley Gorski, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, in a statement to reporters. “The deployment of this society-changing technology is unnecessary and unjustified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9LCfJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The program “could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” says ACLU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0sd2bL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/comment-civil-society-organizations-opposition-cbp-nprm-expanding-biometric-data-collection-us"&gt;The filing&lt;/a&gt; raises a variety of legal objections to the expansion, in particular arguing that Congress did not intend to authorize long-term facial recognition when it mandated biometric exit tracking in 1996. At the time, Congress left the specific method open to interpretation, but the technology for algorithmic facial recognition from a video feed was not yet developed enough to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sz5yo"&gt;The filing also points out that CBP’s proposed collection is more invasive than a simple photograph. Maintaining a facial recognition system will mean creating face prints from the collected images, which will be stored for 75 years and “may be used not only by DHS, but by foreign governments and federal, state, and local law enforcement to identify individuals for a variety of purposes, far removed from the reasons for CBP’s initial collection,” the filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3XMQp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-december2019.pdf"&gt;CBP’s privacy assessment&lt;/a&gt; for the project details some of those additional purposes, stating that photographs collected by the program will also be scanned against the terrorist screening database, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/tecs-system-cbp-primary-and-secondary-processing-tecs-national-sar-initiative"&gt;TECS alerts&lt;/a&gt;, and outstanding warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVDm8o"&gt;“CBP’s collection of faceprints could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” the filing argues. “It could expose where people go, who they associate with, and even what they believe, based on the religious services, protests, or meetings they attend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ya70m"&gt;On a procedural note, the civil rights groups also argue the proposal is unlawful because of broader concerns over the appointment of Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. In November, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/federal-judge-rules-acting-dhs-head-chad-wolf-unlawfully-appointed-n1247848"&gt;ruled that Wolf’s appointment to the position&lt;/a&gt; violated the order of succession for active appointments, and overturned a memorandum from Wolf’s office as a result. It’s unclear whether this same logic could be successfully applied to CBP’s rule-making motion, which was not issued directly from Wolf’s office. Still, the issue is likely to shed further doubt on the proposed rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Zoom escape button is the holiday gift everyone actually needs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnrsryHO39ZZ1Jm9BEcMN28hfNc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561178/staples_easy_button.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Staples&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kz896u"&gt;The worst part of most Zoom meetings is the end. Not because it’s the moment when we have to lose human connection after being isolated for months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end of a Zoom meeting is the worst because it’s so dang hard to quickly and gracefully end a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyzbZ"&gt;With a typical not-Zoom call on a smartphone, you bring the phone down from your ear and tap the end call button. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKW4Qh"&gt;On a Zoom meeting, you say your goodbye pleasantries, put your hand on your mouse, find your mouse on your screen, move it in the right direction toward the end call button, overshoot said button in your desperation to leave the meeting as soon as possible, and then finally click the button, all on video, where anyone who is still in the meeting can see the growing desperation in your eyes as you go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeJmDx"&gt;Brian Moore, a creative director at Anomaly, took it upon himself to make leaving Zoom meetings easier. He made a way to use a physical lamp cord that he can pull on to instantly leave the meeting. Just watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656"&gt;this thing of beauty&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2fQWMX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always awkwardly struggle to get to the end call button on video calls. So I made this &lt;a href="https://t.co/4z4zsxNkeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4z4zsxNkeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Moore (@lanewinfield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kL5Xjc"&gt;And if this looked like something you want to have for yourself, I have good news for you: Moore shared all of the files you’ll need &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanewinfield/zoomout"&gt;to make something like it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cbVhJ"&gt;Now I’m imagining other ways I could quickly escape Zoom meetings. Perhaps smashing a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FStaples-Easy-Button%2Fproduct_606396&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F22193417%2Fzoom-escape-button-holiday-gift-brian-moore-cord-github#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples Easy Button&lt;/a&gt;? Throwing a giant switch like what you’d see in a &lt;a href="https://gifteee.com/products/frankenstein-light-switch-plate-3d-printed-turn-any-room-into-a-mad-scientist-lab"&gt;campy horror movie&lt;/a&gt;? Or, like David Zhou, making a way to end calls &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893"&gt;after sighing loudly&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;inspired by this, i made a script that automatically quits &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@zoom_us&lt;/a&gt; when i sigh really loudly &lt;a href="https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L"&gt;https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jzsh5BCi8p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jzsh5BCi8p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Zhou (@dz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1X5Pls"&gt;The possibilities seem endless here, and I hope more people create fun ways to quickly get out of their Zoom calls. Maybe they will be the 2021 trend that replaces having a creative Zoom background.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EGPxlT"&gt;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate and the creators of Netflix movie &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?tnc_pvfw=ZmlsZT1odHRwczovL2NvcHlyaWdodGxhdGVseS5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjAvMTIvQ29uYW4tRG95bGUtRXN0YXRlLXYuLVNwcmluZ2VyLVN0aXB1bGF0aW9uLXRvLURpc21pc3MtV2l0aC1QcmVqdWRpY2UucGRmJnNldHRpbmdzPTEwMTEwMDExMDEwMTAxMTExMDAmbGFuZz1lbi1VUw==#page=&amp;amp;zoom=&amp;amp;pagemode=none"&gt;agreed to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; a copyright lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;over Sherlock Holmes’ emotions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/enola-holmes-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright Lately&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the outcome today, noting that the court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, possibly indicating that the parties settled. So unfortunately, we don’t know if &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes’&lt;/em&gt; take on Doyle’s famous detective violated copyright by showing a wider range of feelings and greater respect for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHWDOP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; case hinged on Sherlock Holmes’ complicated copyright status. Most Holmes stories sit in the public domain, and stories like &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; — which reimagines Holmes (played by Henry Cavill) having a younger sister — can freely repurpose their elements. But 10 of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are still protected by copyright, and the Doyle estate argued that they depict a meaningfully different version of the character. (He’s more caring, less overtly contemptuous of women and friendship, and generally less of a jerk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVDrtC"&gt;Doyle’s estate claimed that &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; unlawfully used this copyrighted version of Holmes. And it sued author Nancy Springer, who wrote the original &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; series of books, along with Netflix, Springer’s publisher, and the film adaptation’s production company. The lawsuit’s defendants &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/enola-holmes-producers-blast-copyright-infringement-suit-from-conan-doyle-estate"&gt;argued that Doyle’s estate&lt;/a&gt; was trying to copyright “generic concepts like warmth, kindness, empathy, or respect” — rather than any specific plot or character elements contained in those stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD6kWN"&gt;This lawsuit has revived a complicated legal debate over Sherlock Holmes. But the detective likely won’t be under copyright much longer: Doyle’s final stories are set to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-sherlock-holmes-public-domain-20140805-story.html"&gt;fall into the public domain&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
