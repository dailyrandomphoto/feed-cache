    <title>H&amp;R Block is suing Block, formerly Square, over its new name</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ejWGQN"&gt;Tax preparation service H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrblock.com%2Ftax-center%2Fnewsroom%2Faround-block%2Fabout-us%2Ftrademark-infringement-lawsuit%2F%3Fcid%3Dsf252192484%26amp%3Bsf252192484%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841182%2Fsquare-block-hr-block-trademark-lawsuit-jack-dorsey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) for trademark infringement on Thursday, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/hr-block-sues-over-squares-new-name-block.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIYMvH"&gt;“Today’s filing is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we built over more than six decades,”  said H&amp;amp;R Block president and CEO Jeff Jones in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1JB7q"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block claims that Square’s new name competes directly with Block in several areas of financial services, including a recently purchased tax service named &lt;a href="https://cash.app/taxes"&gt;Cash App Taxes&lt;/a&gt; — previously Credit Karma Tax — a $0 tax filing service similar to H&amp;amp;R Block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2FfMBt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are protecting the reputation and trust we have built over 65+ years. This morning, we filed a trademark infringement lawsuit, seeking to prevent Block, Inc.—formerly Square, Inc.—from improperly using the Block name and family of trademarks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6mF55e32GR"&gt;https://t.co/6mF55e32GR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0bRGp2tyk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/L0bRGp2tyk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— H&amp;amp;R Block News (@HRBlockNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HRBlockNews/status/1471458878428782598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zS4Pc"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block said that the company experienced numerous indications that consumers are drawing a link between the companies due to their names being similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m4pDQ"&gt;Block, Inc., co-founded by Jack Dorsey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the company’s name change on December 1st, saying it “acknowledges the company’s growth.” The company cited numerous inspirations for the name change in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004?s=20"&gt;Twitter post&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement, saying that the name represents the neighborhood blocks where the company finds its sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: James Webb Space Telescope’s launch next week, cool gadgets launched this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TlDmxMkjAYLTw81dcegolRoVcAk=/238x0:7375x4758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286240/jwst_mirror.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaRYTM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories. On the final Vergecast of 2021, Nilay and Dieter invite &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior space reporter Loren Grush to the show to cover the last bits of news before the holiday break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cDmYt"&gt;Next week on Christmas Eve, we will see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722559/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-arrives-kourou-french-guiana-launch"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; — successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope — finally launch into space. Loren explains what the JWST will be used for, how the telescope will launch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;the complications with its launch&lt;/a&gt; along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAVg7d"&gt;In the second half of the show, Nilay, Dieter, and Alex go through all the gadgets and software updates announced this past week — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834645/sony-glass-sound-speaker-lspxs3-review"&gt;a Sony speaker that looks like a bong&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;latest phones that fold in half&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly under investigation for how it treats Black female workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Epj5Q0OE89KtNR5QR6Y0E7w5Y_0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286219/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOWJzZ"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is looking into how Google treats its Black female employees, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-california-probes-googles-treatment-black-female-workers-2021-12-17/"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says that the regulator has been asking employees questions about harassment and discrimination, after receiving formal complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ3Fub"&gt;The report doesn’t make any mention of the DFEH bringing charges against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;as it did with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and says that the interviews being conducted don’t necessarily mean that Google could face charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JnxmW2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Black women made up 1.8 percent of Google’s workforce in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw0bFE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560628/google-diversity-report-departures-black-women"&gt;a diversity report Google released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Black women make up around 1.8 percent of its workforce and departed the company at a higher than normal rate. In the report, the company said it had “room for improvement” when it came to keeping underrepresented talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M2DmA"&gt;We’ve heard about issues relating to equity from former employees. Earlier this year, a lawsuit brought against Google by four former female employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457421/lawsuit-former-google-women-class-action-gender-bias-pay-disparity"&gt;was given class-action status&lt;/a&gt;, with the women claiming that they received lower bonuses and salaries than male counterparts. The company also made headlines after AI ethicist Timnit Gebru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;claimed she was retaliated against and fired&lt;/a&gt; for asking the company to be more transparent with its paper publishing process. (Gebru says she faced pushback from the company about her work criticizing its language models.) Another female member of Google’s AI ethics team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;was also fired&lt;/a&gt; after she says she searched her email for evidence of Gebru facing discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bVjCus"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgWI1l"&gt;Google didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment about the DFEH investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horseshoe crabs are in danger because everyone wants their blood </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dis1QT_SK7-LoMVSA34PdjTIHeQ=/81x0:1191x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286162/Horseshoe_Crabs_Fadek_059_e1554413653315.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Horseshoe crabs are bled at the Charles River Laboratory in South Carolina. | Timothy Fadek&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfLf3M"&gt;Conservationists fear that horseshoe crabs, a 450-million-year-old living fossil, will be pushed to the brink of extinction because of the value of their blood to the pharmaceutical industry. Horseshoe crab blood provides a natural source of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/limulus-lysate-test"&gt;limulus amebocyte lysate&lt;/a&gt; (LAL) which is used to test vaccines, drugs, and medical devices to ensure that they aren’t contaminated with dangerous bacterial toxins called endotoxins. With hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs captured and bled of their milky-blue blood each year, conservation groups are now stepping up their advocacy efforts and taking legal action to help save horseshoe crabs and the other species that rely on them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K16qe2"&gt;Fortunately, there’s already an alternative to horseshoe crab blood: in the late 1990s, biologists at the University of Singapore created a synthetic version of the LAL called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28733334/"&gt;recombinant Factor C&lt;/a&gt; (rFC). Multiple &lt;a href="https://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.2144/btn-2020-0165"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that rFC is just as effective as horseshoe crab-derived LAL, and it is currently commercially available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EF4eCt"&gt;Some 60 countries have approved rFC for use, including the EU countries and China. But in the US, conservationists were dealt a setback last year when Maryland-based US Pharmacopeia (USP), an organization that sets guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry, &lt;a href="https://www.uspnf.com/notices/bacterial-endotoxin-test-gen-announcement-20200529"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; it needed to see more data before it would put rFC on equal footing with LAL. Companies can still opt to use rFC as a substitute for LAL (Eli Lilly already does) — but only if they go through additional bureaucratic processes first. Many environmentalists see the lack of approval by USP as short-sighted and unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzDLDU"&gt;“We’re going to live in a world where we have more and more pathogens and the trend is for more pharmaceuticals requiring endotoxin testing,” says Ryan Phelan, executive director and co-founder of the environmental nonprofit &lt;a href="http://reviverestore.org/"&gt;Revive &amp;amp; Restore&lt;/a&gt;. “At some point, that’s going to put pressure on the supply of a non-sustainable product. Why would you not ensure your supply line?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3rjKc"&gt;The global pharmaceutical and medical industry uses LAL to make sure that vaccines and a wide variety of medical devices and products are free from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-technical-guides/bacterial-endotoxinspyrogens"&gt;endotoxin contamination&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause fever, anaphylactic shock, and diseases like the bubonic plague. During testing, LAL clots around endotoxins, flagging their presence and quantifying the level of contamination. High demand for the compound can cause a quart of LAL to sell for $15,000 or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahnjAY"&gt;As a result, the business of bleeding horseshoe crabs is thriving. Today, American biomedical companies capture some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006607"&gt;500,000&lt;/a&gt; horseshoe crabs a year, a practice overseen by the &lt;a href="http://www.asmfc.org/"&gt;Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission&lt;/a&gt;. But there are few laws or regulations in place to protect or limit the take of horseshoe crabs. And although the horseshoe crabs are eventually returned to the sea, conservation groups estimate that up to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006607#sec002"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of them die in the process. Due to pressure from the biomedical industry, along with habitat loss and the harvest of horseshoe crabs by commercial fishermen to use as bait, populations both in the US and worldwide have plummeted in recent decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HExETd"&gt;In the Delaware Bay, home to the largest population in the US, horseshoe crab numbers have declined from &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a67c452bff2004b42a313d9/t/5e3e0869c0b9914844db6a6a/1581123692672/1990+HSC+Survey+Report.pdf"&gt;1.24 million&lt;/a&gt; in 1990 to less than &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a67c452bff2004b42a313d9/t/5e3e07c5f875f52b5637a9b6/1581123528301/2002+HSC+Survey+Report.pdf"&gt;334,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. Although the population appears to have stabilized, conservationists worry that increased demand for American horseshoe crab blood by the pharmaceutical industry could force it to go the way of the Asian horseshoe crab, &lt;em&gt;Tachypleus tridentatus&lt;/em&gt;, which is rapidly disappearing in China and which the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists as &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/21309/149768986"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the American horseshoe crab is listed as a &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11987/80159830"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dDjhYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re actually one of the most valuable marine species on the East Coast.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M80j59"&gt;Relying on horseshoe crabs for pharmaceuticals has knock-on effects to other species. As part of the bleeding process, &lt;a href="https://www.criver.com/"&gt;Charles River Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, one of the primary producers of LAL, sequesters crabs in holding pens away from the beach from May to June — the season when they lay eggs. During that window, a female horseshoe crab can lay as many as 80,000 eggs. &lt;a href="https://defenders.org/blog/2021/11/work-remains-safeguard-south-carolinas-horseshoe-crabs"&gt;Environmentalists&lt;/a&gt; contend that removing horseshoe crabs from the beach decreases the availability of horseshoe crab eggs as a food source for shorebirds such as the migratory red knot. The population of red knots, a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, has &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/elly-pepper/red-knot-listed-threatened-under-endangered-species-act"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 80 percent in recent decades. Conservationists maintain that this decline is linked to a diminished supply of horseshoe crab eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UodH4g"&gt;As a result of this linkage, the environmental nonprofits &lt;a href="https://defenders.org/"&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.coastalconservationleague.org/"&gt;Coastal Conservation League&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/press-release/state-sanctioned-horseshoe-crab-confinement-threatens-shorebirds/"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Charles River Laboratories of their intent to sue both entities for alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuit seeks to protect the red knot’s food source and habitat by asking the state to end Charles River Labs’ practice of penning horseshoe crabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7Qx8P"&gt;“The ponds maintained by agents of Charles River Labs further imperil the existence of red knots, a species whose fate already hangs in the balance,” Lindsay Dubin, staff attorney for Defenders of Wildlife, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtEmlg"&gt;South Carolina’s Department of Natural Resources declined to comment on the lawsuit. Charles River Labs declined to provide specific responses about their horseshoe crab penning practices or its effect on red knot populations. Sam Jorgensen, a spokesperson for Charles River Labs, wrote in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company doesn’t see merit in the lawsuit and that it has taken strides to “protect and preserve a healthy and growing horseshoe crab population,” including by supporting an effort to ban the use of horseshoe crabs as fishing bait in eel and whelk fisheries. Jorgensen also noted that horseshoe crabs play a “vital role” in the healthcare system and that synthetic alternatives to LAL are “not readily available” or FDA-approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxKJ4"&gt;But despite the bureaucratic obstacles that currently stand in the way of widespread adoption of rFC in the US, advocates continue to urgently press for a switch away from a reliance on horseshoe crab blood. In addition to being more humane, rFC is lab-produced, so companies don’t have to worry about variance in the size of individual crabs or changes in their population, factors that can affect the production of LAL. If demand increases, manufacturers could produce more rFC at scale, which could lower the cost of production and make it less expensive. Critics of rFC like Charles River Laboratories — which, notably, stands to lose business if rFC becomes more widely used —&lt;a href="https://www.criver.com/eureka/recombinant-factor-c-under-the-microscope"&gt; maintain&lt;/a&gt; that rFC needs further study and testing to prove that it is completely safe and fully establish its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="umNd2m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a win-win for any pharmaceutical company that adopts this technology.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIZ8vY"&gt;The debate is particularly critical today; the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a huge surge of &lt;a href="https://www.bio.org/policy/human-health/vaccines-biodefense/coronavirus/pipeline-tracker"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; into vaccines and potential COVID-19 treatments which rely on the use of LAL to ensure product safety. As demand for vaccines and other medical products increases, conservationists worry that without a rapid switch to rFC, strain on the American horseshoe crab and the other creatures that rely on them will only get worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvX57N"&gt;Larry Niles, a wildlife biologist and expert on the environmental issues of the Delaware Bay, says there is an inherent contradiction in the way state and federal agencies view horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs are not a protected species and therefore they don’t see them as valuable, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QCjsO"&gt;“Yet they acknowledge that there’s a $500 billion industry for their blood, so they’re not worthless,” Niles says. “They’re actually one of the most valuable marine species on the East Coast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re6UNd"&gt;It remains to be seen if lawsuits and increasing pressure from the public and environmental groups will force state and federal agencies to more rigorously regulate and protect horseshoe crabs or promote the adoption of rFC. However, Phelan hopes eventually labs and other pharmaceutical industry players will recognize the benefits of rFC, both in terms of cost and reliability. Adopting rFC will benefit companies as well as horseshoe crabs, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feGXbQ"&gt;“It’s a win-win for any pharmaceutical company that adopts this technology because they are going to have better quality control, better scientific output,” Phelan says. “Also, their employees, their stakeholders, or shareholders will feel better since they’re doing the right thing for the ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The only Christmas tradition I care about is Sweden’s arson goat </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COMBO-SWEDEN-TRADITION-CHRISTMAS-GOAT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmj0zzY2B_-n92joJT3P3Inf0ko=/148x0:3748x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286131/1237282875.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWSDvt"&gt;If you’ve never heard of the Gävle Goat before, there are just two critical pieces of information you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeSqe1"&gt;First: the Gävle Goat is a giant straw statue of a goat erected every Christmas in the Swedish town of Gävle. It’s essentially a massive Yule Goat, a traditional symbol of the Yuletide season in areas of Scandinavia and Northern Europe, and was first installed in the town in 1966. The most recent incarnation stands 42 feet high and weighs 3.6 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdhcWE"&gt;Second: every year, someone tries to set the goat on fire. And most years, they succeed — including this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBoFCP"&gt;As the BBC reported &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59696442"&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;: “A giant straw goat that has become an annual highlight in the Swedish city of Gavle has been burned by an arsonist. A man in his 40s was arrested after the structure was set alight in the early hours of Friday. The goat has been attacked many times before but survived every festive period since 2016 under 24-hour security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXhAi3"&gt;I know this sounds sad, but it’s also, I think, the actual spirit of Christmas. Not the arson itself, but what the arson represents: the eternal battle between goat-erectors and goat-burners; between the forces of cozy commercialization, eager to smother the season in ribbons, presents, and sparkly lights, and the contrasting, primeval urge to set something huge on fire because &lt;em&gt;the sun has disappeared and who knows when it’s coming back&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SWEDEN-CHRISTMAS-GOAT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_TEgkLfo0Mp48nRiFBVGXH2riH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23103785/499140902.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gavle Goat in 2015. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cOLPqE"&gt;This timeless struggle between humanity and nature plays out beautifully on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat#2020%E2%80%932029"&gt;Wikipedia page for the Gävle Goat&lt;/a&gt;, which records the beast’s fate every year as well preventative measures taken by the authorities and the manner of its demise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9D6f5"&gt;Since 1966, the goat has been “stolen,” “hit by a car,”  and “kicked to pieces,” but the most popular method of dispatch is undoubtedly arson. Drunken teenagers, Norwegians, and even a passing American have all been blamed for attacks over the years, but it’s curious to me how ill-prepared these culprits often seem. It’s as if they hadn’t actually planned the attacks but were simply compelled in the moment by forces beyond their reckoning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0ZVR0"&gt;Consider, for example, in 2015, when a 26-year-old was arrested for torching the goat and fined 100,000 kronor ($10,989) in damages. The man was seen fleeing the scene right after the statue went up in flames and, when detained by a guard, was &lt;a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20161111/trial-of-drunken-christmas-goat-burner-begins-in-sweden/"&gt;quickly identified&lt;/a&gt; as the guilty party because he had “a singed face, smelled of gasoline, and was holding a lighter in his hand.” This, I think, sounds less like a hardened criminal and more like a man possessed by the spirit of his pagan ancestors to restart the fires of the world — to bring warmth and light back into the universe — one goat at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3Cgcg"&gt;Okay, so, I know that burning down a statue is no fun at all for the people whose job it is to fund and protect it. As &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported, a spokeswoman for the goat (A goatswoman? A spokesgoat?), one Rebecca Steiner, was devastated by this year’s attack. She told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;: “It’s just a week before Christmas, and I cannot understand how a person can carry out this kind of attack to a Christmas symbol known all over the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acVbyG"&gt;But come on. At this point in time, the Gävle Goat is more famous for being burned down than it is for being left intact. And the authorities certainly aren’t afraid of, shall we say, playing with fire. An &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken"&gt;official Twitter account for the goat&lt;/a&gt; has been practically goading would-be arsonists, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken/status/1471182248485474309"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, “Half way through and this goat is still standing and looking so good!” and then again &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken/status/1471597216511021061"&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Chesney Hawkes, “I’m the one and only...” Those sound like fighting words, and I know that if I lived in Gävle, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; topic of conversation in the pub would be “who’s going to get that bastard goat this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AzjoXb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Half way through and this goat is still standing and looking so good!  &lt;br&gt;#gävlebocken#smashing &lt;a href="https://t.co/2Sp7ovMYH9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2Sp7ovMYH9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gävlebocken (@Gavlebocken) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken/status/1471182248485474309?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqnbgj"&gt;Well, this year, they got him. The fire-worshippers won, and the goat-erectors will have to console themselves with the international publicity they attracted. But we shouldn’t mourn the Gävle Goat any more than we mourn barren trees and empty fields. For if winter teaches us anything, it’s that life is cyclical, that good times follow bad, and that although the sun has disappeared and things look bleak, if we keep warm and dry, things will get better in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUBH2k"&gt;Yes, the goat has gone, but it’s only a matter of time before it comes back — and only a matter of time before someone tries to burn it down again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon shareholders are calling for independent audit of how the company treats workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dcy0kPRHTQrBx04wku0idvCYiYU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70285873/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon investors want an audit of the company’s workplace safety  | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gzrjrm"&gt;Citing the recent scrutiny on its employees’ working conditions, a group of Amazon shareholders has filed a resolution asking the board of directors to commission an independent audit on workplace health and safety at the company. The resolution calls for the audit to be conducted with input from Amazon employees and experts in workplace safety and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzRTkk"&gt;“As Amazon strives to be ‘the Earth’s Safest Place to Work,’ a review is needed of the practices that have made the company a leader in workplace injuries and a target for criticism and regulation,” the shareholders’ resolution reads. “With surveillance and productivity quotas linked to high injury rates, we urge Amazon to commission an independent audit of these practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoxBwO"&gt;If Amazon doesn’t challenge the resolution, shareholders will vote on it at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wcn8p"&gt;Mary Beth Gallagher is director of engagement at Domini Impact Investments, which filed the resolution. She said Amazon needs to evaluate its business model, as well as its high turnover and injury rates. Gallagher pointed to the numerous safety &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810754/amazon-new-york-ag-reinstate-fired-worker-health-safety-covid"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783988/amazon-ordered-pay-500000-hiding-covid-case-numbers-california-workers"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; about Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188292/amazon-workers-coronavirus-essential-service-risk"&gt;workplaces&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and the deaths of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"&gt;six people at an Amazon warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois that was struck by a tornado on December 10th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWhSun"&gt;All the incidents “have raised serious questions and drawn scrutiny from legislators, regulators, and the public,” Gallagher said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. She said Domini wants the audit to examine “the way in which employee productivity metrics and surveillance contribute to a less safe and stable work environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m9mrJ"&gt;Courtenay Brown, a worker at an Amazon Fresh warehouse in New Jersey and leader of workers’ group United for Respect, testified before Congress on December 7th about work conditions at her facility. She said she sorts up to 50,000 groceries for delivery daily, stepping in and out of temperatures as low as minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the warehouse is understaffed, there are few opportunities for breaks. And, she said, workers are monitored from the moment they pull into the parking lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKFvNR"&gt;“If we fall behind in any way during our 11 hour shift, we risk being disciplined,” Brown said before the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth. “We are pushed to our limit to the point where we can’t even take regular bathroom breaks. Often we have to run to and from the bathroom in under two minutes so we don’t get in trouble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAJ01B"&gt;The shareholders want the audit to evaluate the company’s productivity quotas, surveillance practices, and the effects of these practices on injury rates and turnover. Amazon did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x779SH"&gt;Gallagher says her company’s hope is that a thorough evaluation “will produce corporate policy changes that make workplaces safer for associates and cement Amazon as the industry leader in health and safety it states it wants to be.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoqTQy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="behdFk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FedEx receives its first electric delivery vans from GM’s BrightDrop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6peY-grffxSPDGCSthqewv6pNz0=/0x157:8509x5830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70285627/BrightDrop_EV600_with_FedEx_Express_Branding.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yMlHaq"&gt;FedEx is the first customer to receive electric delivery vans from General Motors’ new EV-focused company BrightDrop. The logistics giant says it will integrate the EVs into its fleet starting in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckuDR6"&gt;BrightDrop, which is GM’s new dedicated electric delivery van spinoff, said it delivered five of its larger-sized EV600 delivery vans to FedEx, the first in a planned 500-vehicle order. The EV600, which went into production last fall, has 600 cubic feet of cargo space, can travel up to 250 miles on a full battery, and has a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k04xJ"&gt;The vans were delivered to FedEx’s facility in Inglewood, California, where they will be housed and maintained. FedEx plans to begin deploying BrightDrop’s vehicles on the roads making deliveries in Los Angeles starting in the first half of 2022 and will add more vehicles as BrightDrop makes them available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="71hYh8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx has more than 200,000 motorized vehicles in its fleet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S6c2zX"&gt;FedEx has more than 200,000 motorized vehicles in its fleet. As of 2019, the company had 2,944 electric vehicles in service, which included electric and hybrid delivery trucks, forklifts, and airport ground service equipment. The company has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;spending $2 billion to become carbon neutral&lt;/a&gt; by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdJlv6"&gt;When GM first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;creation of BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;, it brought up FedEx’s interest in buying electric vans from the company as a point of validation. What it didn’t mention was that FedEx has been on the hunt for a reliable EV supplier for a long time. The company had a deal with erstwhile EV startup Chanje to buy 1,000 electric delivery vans but was left in the lurch when Chanje failed to make good on its promise. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822775/chanje-fdg-electric-delivery-vans-investigation-amazon"&gt;FedEx is now suing Chanje&lt;/a&gt;, which officially shut down earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArV6ih"&gt;GM also partnered with FedEx Express on a pilot last year to test out the EP1, an electric pallet that can be used to transport packages from a delivery vehicle to a customer’s front door. Using the electric pallet allowed FedEx workers to handle 25 percent more packages a day, GM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW5cDq"&gt;Meanwhile, GM decided to spin off a new EV-focused logistics business as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536601/gm-ev-investment-increase-amount-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;a massive, $35 billion pivot to electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Could a Witcher-style multiverse really exist? We asked a physicist  </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnbGbnC-buBXg5hZJWaLkSfXFlA=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70285584/W_207_Unit_01998_RT.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Toss a coin to the physicist who agreed to this interview&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="LJQakt"&gt;Those who plan on watching the second season of Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;can look forward to plenty of epic monster battles, character development, and Henry Cavill staring broodingly into the middle distance. But season 2 also reveals a lot about the broader world that &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; takes place in — or more accurately, the many worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ierZlS"&gt;Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;this darker and more serious&lt;/a&gt; chapter in the epic fantasy saga zooms in on a seminal event in the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; lore known as the &lt;a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Conjunction_of_the_Spheres"&gt;conjunction of the spheres&lt;/a&gt;. During the conjunction, which took place approximately 1,500 years before the events of the show, a bunch of different spheres of reality collided with one another, causing elves, dwarves, humans, and monsters to all get mixed up together on the same continent, much to their mutual discontent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMkcqt"&gt;While this cosmic collision is pure fantasy, there is a potentially scientific idea at its core: some physicists have proposed that our universe may really be just one in a much grander multiverse of realities. If that’s true, it may even be possible for different universes to interact to some extent. These ideas are wildly controversial, with one camp of physicists arguing that the multiverse is more a matter of philosophy or religion than a fruitful terrain for scientific inquiry. Others say that since we can’t rule out the existence of a multiverse, there’s no harm in speculating about its nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9lKOY"&gt;With season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; dropping on Netflix today, it felt like an apt time for some rampant speculation. To keep things as scientifically grounded as possible, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;chatted with University of California, San Diego&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cosmologist &lt;a href="https://briankeating.com/"&gt;Brian Keating&lt;/a&gt; about some of the most mind-bending multiverse ideas physicists have proposed, where pop culture stretches these ideas beyond recognition, and the cosmic horizons we may never see past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVXrJq"&gt;This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1kELg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Witcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is not alone in popularizing the idea of the multiverse. It’s a big theme in the Marvel cinematic universe now, it’s in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Some physicists would say the multiverse is nothing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; science fiction. But could you tell us a bit about why others think it might really exist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTd53q"&gt;Yeah. So the multiverse is kind of a natural extrapolation of what we call the Copernican principle, which is that where we are and who we are and what we are shouldn’t be significant or aberrant. It should be kind of representative of the properties throughout all of reality. And just as there’s many planets, there are many stars, there are many galaxies, and there are many clusters of galaxies, so, too, the logic would have one believe there is no reason to suspect that there should be only one universe. In fact, one of the foremost proponents of the multiverse paradigm, &lt;a href="https://sitp.stanford.edu/events/andrei-linde-universe-or-multiverse"&gt;Andrei Linde&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a professor at Stanford, claims that we shouldn’t be biased in favor of a universe. That we should, in fact, start from this [idea] that there probably is a multiverse. And the notion has been extended by other people to really encompass all the different types of possibilities for the existence of more than one universe: A universe that is characterized by laws of physics, constants of nature, intelligent or conscious beings, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oi16Tk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no doubt in any physicists’ minds that there are regions of our universe which are unobservable to us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R7E52d"&gt;The multiverse comes as directly as a consequence of two very different branches of physics. One is cosmology, in particular what’s called inflation, the theory of the ultra-high energy origin of the expansion of space and time that would later become our observable universe. And also from string theory, which predicts sort of a landscape of possible values for different fundamental constants and forces. So these two different fields, which aren’t really associated with one another, both imply that there is the possibility for a multiverse. And as yet, there is a vast disagreement as to whether or not the multiverse actually is part of physics, or if it’s pure philosophy. And if it’s part of physics, how could one go about testing it or even falsifying its existence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ObRPK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So to be clear, we have no direct evidence for the existence of a multiverse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0l8URu"&gt;So the question is whether or not it’s even in principle &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to provide evidence that supports a multiverse. And if such evidence can’t be found, is it possible to rule out the existence of the multiverse? Because you might be living in a multiverse, but then you might not be able to detect that you’re living in a multiverse the same way that bacteria in a petri dish can’t detect that they live inside of a laboratory inside of a building inside of a planet. It’s too remote from the sphere of reality that they have access to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZA0wmC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like eating cosmic Wonder Bread.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vD9iIz"&gt;Now, there are people who propose there are ways to measure the possibility that we are in a multiverse. The one particular signature would be looking for an impact, or a collision with another universe, that would produce an observational pattern in the oldest light in the universe called the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is what I study. And that theory, or conjecture, is pretty wildly contested. It’s not at all clear if you could categorically detect and therefore motivate the existence of the multiverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRfJ9W"&gt;But there’s no doubt in any physicists’ minds that there are regions of our universe which are unobservable to us. And in that sense, you know, we already believe in a sort of multiverse. But then, extending and adding new features onto that multiverse, from inflation or from string theory, that’s where things get very controversial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC6jvU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I said a moment ago, we’ve seen a lot of depictions of the idea of the multiverse in pop culture. I think what makes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Witcher &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stand out a little bit is it’s not just positing there are all these different universes out there in their own separate bubbles, but that universes have collided with each other. There’s a historical, cataclysmic collision that sort of sets the stage for the events of the series. In the context of a multiverse, do physicists have any ideas as to whether, or how, different universes might interact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIVspt"&gt;First of all, physicists aren’t in agreement that the multiverse is a serious scientific paradigm worthy of discussion. A lot of people believe it’s not. On the other hand, if you do take it seriously, then you can ask questions about it. But then it’s not clear whether or not there’s any evidence, or set of evidence, that could prove it wrong. Because you could say, well, we thought this was evidence for the multiverse. But actually, in the multiverse, since anything is possible to happen, you can get any range of predictions that you want. And so it’s kind of unsatisfying. It’s like eating cosmic Wonder Bread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giG1h4"&gt;In the context where these universes collide, it could be just as light travels at a finite speed, the Sun could disappear right now, and we wouldn’t see it for eight minutes. So it’s not possible to say something is ruled out just by not seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4s8oN"&gt;So there could be a multiverse. It could be one light-year away from us, in a certain sense, in which case next year we’ll see it. It could be 10^50 light-years away from us, in which case we’ll never see it. So it could turn out, yes, tomorrow we impact a universe that’s one light-year away from us. But the thing I would gently push back on is that the notion of a collision nucleating some vast explosion is not at all clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2AnPLv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just because something is mathematically possible doesn’t mean it has any physical relevance.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuNoHR"&gt;For example, we know for sure we will eventually collide with the Andromeda galaxy, which is our nearest neighbor galaxy. It’s almost like a twin sister of ours, and it has almost the same number of stars, hundreds of billions of stars. It’s even more massive than ours, and it’s one of the few galaxies we’re moving towards rather than expanding away from, according to Hubble. That galaxy will someday crash into our galaxy, but it’s not like every single point will collide and each star will hit another star. In fact, they’ll mostly pass right through each other. So if a galaxy, which is billions of times more dense than the universe on average, can pass right through another galaxy, all the more so a universe could pass through another universe in a certain sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TympVk"&gt;So I think it’s artistic license to suggest that that could nucleate some fireworks. But I admit it’s pretty cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElySmS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could there be any sorts of interactions between different universes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtdCiu"&gt;Yeah, in fact, one of the ways you might see the impact of a universe adjacent to ours is that it might have a gravitational force that deflects the light traveling in our universe. But all of this would be taking place at the boundary of what we can see just today. In other words, it wouldn’t be happening to us. It would be happening 45 billion light-years away from us and we would just be seeing it now [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: 45 billion light years is the approximate radius of the observable universe&lt;/em&gt;]. Unless you’re talking about some interdimensional wormhole between different universes, and that’s incredibly speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S0fnQ"&gt;And some of the problems with these physical phenomena when applied to science fiction, like wormholes and other things, is that they’re barely at the level of speculation. They’re completely removed from testability in laboratory settings. They’re mathematical possibilities. But as I always say, mathematics allows the possibility for infinity. You know, just divide one by zero. But there is nothing that we know about in the universe that’s infinite. Nothing that has infinite temperature, density, pressure, energy, etc. So just because something is mathematically possible doesn’t mean it has any physical relevance. So I don’t want to be a downer. But the reality is, yes, it is possible to witness the effects of another universe interacting with ours. But it would be occurring not here, but a very, very distant there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbQJu8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So it sounds like a physically plausible story about the multiverse would not have a lot of cool stuff to look at. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErRgiq"&gt;Well, yeah, it’s like saying, you know, a black hole or a wormhole as is possible. Of course, we measure black holes, but we don’t measure any near us, right? There’s not one that we can kind of play with and jump into and then pop out, you know, in the Andromeda galaxy, even, let alone in another universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iGR8ME"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no reason to be chauvinistic, to think it would be like our universe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HsLeWG"&gt;And by the way, if the laws of physics change from universe to universe, it’s not at all clear that the laws of mathematics, or the laws of logic, would be forbidden from changing. In other words, you get into a wormhole in our universe. You pop out in another universe. Well, the laws of wormholes are based on the laws of black holes, which are the consequence of general relativity, which is a consequence of partial differential equations, which is a consequence of calculus, which is a consequence of real numbers. And who knows if there’s such a thing as real numbers in another universe? Just as the old joke goes, an old fish swims by two young fish and says to them, “How’s the water?” And they say, “What’s water?” They have no concept of it. It’s so alien to their existence that they can’t even contemplate it. And there’s no reason to be chauvinistic, to think it would be like our universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abgE0F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like we see that idea represented at least a little bit allegorically in science fiction — and this true in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Witcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as well — in how when beings move from universe to universe, they often can’t survive in the other universe for an extended period of time because it’s fundamentally so different.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8vJQa"&gt;In my first book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Losing-Nobel-Prize-Cosmology-Ambition/dp/1324000910?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Losing the Nobel Prize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I made this kind of analogy which I called the petriverse. So imagine there’s some bacterium and it’s in a petri dish and it starts making a colony. That bacterium, if it was very smart, could realize that there’s a possibility for another colony really far away from it to exist because it has the agar gel and it has gravity and sunlight and whatever. It could deduce that there is a possibility for another universe in the petriverse, and actually some of these other colonies when they do form, even though they are only a couple of centimeters away, they produce toxins that prevent other bacteria from invading their space. So it’s like, a barrier that makes it inhospitable and hostile to the existence of hopping between universes, just like what you described. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9auN2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of advances in physics could we make in the coming decades that might shed light on this question of whether the multiverse is real? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNBLLN"&gt;I think the field that I’m studying, which is the cosmic microwave background, the key observable, and what we’re trying to discover, is unequivocal evidence that inflation took place. And if inflation took place, that would come concomitantly with the multiverse in most physicists’ anticipation. They go as a direct consequence. If you discover these waves of gravity embedded in the cosmic microwave background, then you would get a very strong piece of evidence that would seem to mandate the multiverse exists. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Keating later clarified that this would be ‘perhaps the strongest circumstantial evidence possible’ for a multiverse.&lt;/em&gt;] On the other hand, it may be that inflation took place, but it’s too weak to produce observable gravitational waves, in which case you might need to wait till a future version of the &lt;a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/"&gt;LIGO&lt;/a&gt; [the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory] experiment in space called &lt;a href="https://lisa.nasa.gov/"&gt;LISA&lt;/a&gt;. And that could potentially take us back and show us evidence of the fundamental origination from, perhaps, the surrounding multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OENgck"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The multiverse ensures full employment for cosmologists for years to come.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlbpWs"&gt;And I should point out there’s other ways that multiverses [could exist]. There’s a quantum mechanical version of the multiverse called the “many worlds interpretation.” And that’s that at every possible moment of time, every possible choice, every possible observable, is instantiated. But we only observe one particular outcome for each observation because we’re sort of coherently oscillating with those quantum mechanical wave functions, and therefore we can observe them. Those are kind of parallel universes going on right now. So if I turn my head to the right or the left, there’s a whole universe where Brian turned his head to the left. So that’s a version of the multiverse. There’s also a version of the multiverse where the universe is cyclical in a certain sense; it’s coming into existence, it’s coming out of existence in a collapse. It’s reemerging, and it’s kind of growing, and then that universe collapses. So that’s kind of a temporal multiverse. And those kinds of models have been around since antiquity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwFLPA"&gt;I would say, it’s hard to find a model of cosmology that doesn’t have some version of a multiverse in it, whether that’s temporal or spatial, or spatial and temporal, or quantum mechanical. So there are hopes that one could get some confidence from measuring aspects of quantum mechanics. And then there’s the cosmic and gravitational wave experiments that I do. And then, perhaps if string theory were to make much more concrete predictions. So I think there’s a lot more theoretical advances that need to be made, a lot more experimental [advances]. But fundamentally, we may never be able to prove it wrong. In other words, you ruled out 10^499 different universes but you didn’t rule out this one. And these observations therefore become what’s called unfalsifiable. In which case you can’t prove that inflation’s wrong, but you also can’t prove that the alternatives are right. And in that case, all hope would be lost. You can’t prove it using an experiment or evidence, you can only prove it on Twitter or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTteDx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like the multiverse is going to continue to fuel physics beef for many years to come. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAMqKc"&gt;Yes. I always say, inflation for economists means one thing. But for us, the multiverse ensures full employment for cosmologists for years to come. And for science fiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4T149q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJ4Tko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taUbu3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZcvUK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wT2vtr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVg2bK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50G7Gn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayEPk1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg9tsT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Jfk2b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPEhlh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHb7Av"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru68b8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bY7DTW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh3SuA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gZHdF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLmuSr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWyeRt"&gt;Peloton has removed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831861/peloton-and-just-like-that-big-commercial-response"&gt;viral ad starring Chris Noth&lt;/a&gt;, the actor who plays Mr. Big in HBO Max’s &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;and its sequel series &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That, &lt;/em&gt;after Noth was accused of sexual assault. Peloton says it’s stopped promoting the videos until it “learns more” about the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ9Xia"&gt;In a story &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/chris-noth-accused-of-sexual-assault-1235063596/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, two women alleged that Noth assaulted them in 2004 and 2015 respectively. One of the women said that “seeing that [Noth] was reprising his role in Sex and the City set off something in me.” She added: “For so many years, I buried it,” but decided it was time “to try to go public with who he is.” Noth has denied the allegations against him and claims the sexual encounters were consensual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0a6YW0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every single sexual assault accusation must be taken seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KR6FHx"&gt;A spokesperson for Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/peloton-chris-noth-sexual-assault-allegations-1235063871/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was unaware of the allegations when it made the commercial. “Every single sexual assault accusation must be taken seriously,” said a spokesperson for the company. “We were unaware of these allegations when we featured Chris Noth in our response to HBO’s reboot. As we seek to learn more, we have stopped promoting this video and archived related social posts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GovZT5"&gt;The ad essentially resurrected Noth’s character after he was killed off in an episode of &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That &lt;/em&gt;after a 45-minute Peloton workout. It was made in collaboration with actor Ryan Reynolds and his marketing company, Maximum Effort. Reynolds supplied a voiceover for the commercial, which extolled the benefits of Peloton’s exercise bikes for healthy living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49l2v8"&gt;The ad has now been deleted from social media accounts belonging to Peloton, Maximum Effort, and Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt;
