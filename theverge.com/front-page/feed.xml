    <title>Second judge says Trump can’t ban TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gx9fDf"&gt;A federal judge has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297117%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-59-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;granted a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; that should keep the US Commerce Department from banning transactions with TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BycUMg"&gt;The Trump administration issued an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; that would have blocked transactions between US companies and TikTok and WeChat’s Chinese parent companies, ByteDance and Tencent. Trump declared TikTok and WeChat a “national emergency,” citing privacy and security concerns. That order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law that allows Trump to ban transactions between the US and foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQVgoy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lozD"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297119%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-60-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in his opinion&lt;/a&gt; accompanying today’s decision, US district judge Carl Nichols said that “the government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.” He granted TikTok’s motion for a preliminary injunction against each item the Commerce Department was attempting to prohibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3HpvQ"&gt;Nichols also previously granted a preliminary injunction on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458375/tiktok-judge-trump-china-ban-app-bytedance"&gt;September 27th&lt;/a&gt; that allowed people to continue downloading the app in the US. At that time, he didn’t rule on the Commerce Department’s other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj0xF3"&gt;A Pennsylvania federal judge had already effectively stopped TikTok from shutting down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542641/tiktok-ban-commerce-department-blocked-november-12-influencers"&gt;on October 30th&lt;/a&gt;, in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators. The Commerce Department had already conceded the matter last month, saying it wouldn’t enforce the shutdown order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562947/tiktok-us-government-no-shutdown-china-trump-security"&gt;on November 12th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DluYYd"&gt;“We’re pleased that the court agreed with us and granted a preliminary injunction against all the prohibitions of the Executive Order,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re focused on continuing to build TikTok as the home that 100 million Americans, including families and small businesses, rely upon for expression, connection, economic livelihood, and true joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0I9Vcd"&gt;The Commerce Department hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1bABR"&gt;The Trump administration had set a December 4th deadline for ByteDance to sell or spin out TikTok’s business in the US, but the government said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154801/us-government-tiktok-ban-deadline-bytedance-trump-administration-cfius"&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt; that it would not extend or enforce the deadline. President Trump has said he approves of a bid by Oracle and Walmart “in concept” that would create a US-based entity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21437850/president-trump-approves-oracle-tiktok-partnership-bytedance-china-ban"&gt;TikTok Global&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear how that would address some security risks, and the deal has not received final approval from China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With guns drawn, police raid home and seize computers of COVID-19 data whistleblower</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ZjnLP"&gt;Eight months ago, Deborah Birx of the White House Coronavirus Task Force &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-deborah-birx-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-april-19-2020/"&gt;praised Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard&lt;/a&gt; as an example of “the kind of knowledge and power we need to put into the hands of the American people.” That dashboard was built by Rebekah Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwXwwE"&gt;But in May, Jones was fired by the Florida Department of Health for reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;refusing to manipulate that data to justify reopening the state&lt;/a&gt; — and now, Florida state police have raided her home and taken the equipment she was using to maintain a new, independent COVID-19 tracker of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUXgIo"&gt;Jones posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; about the incident, including a video of police entering — with guns drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YjXZgx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1/&lt;br&gt;There will be no update today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 8:30 am this morning, state police came into my house and took all my hardware and tech.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were serving a warrant on my computer after DOH filed a complaint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They pointed a gun in my face.  They pointed guns at my kids.. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DE2QfOmtPU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DE2QfOmtPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HnS2GZ"&gt;Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247680010.html"&gt;to the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/12/07/agents-raid-home-fired-florida-data-scientist-who-built-covid-19-dashboard-rebekah-jones/6482817002/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Tallahassee Democrat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that police had a search warrant and had seized her equipment. Here’s the department’s full statement as provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Txnc2f"&gt;“This morning FDLE served a search warrant at a residence on Centerville Court in Tallahassee, the home of Rebekah Jones. FDLE began an investigation November 10, 2020 after receiving a complaint from the Department of Health regarding unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system which is part of an emergency alert system, to be used for emergencies only. Agents believe someone at the residence on Centerville Court illegally accessed the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBuLx"&gt;When agents arrived, they knocked on the door and called Ms. Jones in an attempt to minimize disruption to the family. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter.  Ms. Jones family was upstairs when agents made entry into the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="isKyMx"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/11/27/floridas-emergency-communications-channel-hacked-according-to-state-officials/"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, someone mysteriously sent an unauthorized message to the state’s emergency public health and medical coordination team, reading “speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL9ZCf"&gt;According to an affidavit provided to us by the FDLE, law enforcement believes that Jones or someone at her address was the one who sent it. We’re not publishing the affidavit because it contains lots of personally identifying information, but the FDLE claims the message was sent from a Comcast IP associated with her home address and email address, and the affidavit asks permission to seize and search all computer equipment police might find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivIi6Z"&gt;While there was a suggestion last month that the system might have been hacked, it apparently didn’t have particularly strong security anyhow: the affidavit says all of the registered users shared the same username and password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZMdGD"&gt;Jones didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255"&gt;she says&lt;/a&gt; she’s getting a new computer and will continue to update her new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NT73MJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Desantis thought pointing a gun in my face was a good way to get me to shut up, he's about to learn just how wrong he was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll have a new computer tomorrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I'm going to get back to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to help, my website is still at &lt;a href="https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv"&gt;https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine monitoring program may be at risk of false reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2bN1V-7rVSBcskEe-E541V0GYc=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473745/1229760024.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SroJ7n"&gt;A text-messaging program to monitor any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine may be open to manipulation, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/07/v-safe-tool-covid-vaccine-side-effects/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Experts worry that the newly-developed system focuses more on ease of use than security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxcaDH"&gt;The program, called v-safe, is being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check in with people after they’ve received a COVID-19 vaccine. After getting a shot, they’ll be given a piece of paper with a QR code, which lets them sign up to receive texts. The texts will direct them to online surveys that ask questions about any symptoms someone experienced after receiving the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebx9WX"&gt;Other vaccine safety monitoring systems that have been in place for decades, including the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), will also be used to follow COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Those are passive systems, and rely on patients or doctors reaching out to make a report. V-safe is intended as an early, active way to understand people’s experience with the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVgS7o"&gt;“It’s going to start collecting data immediately on day zero, and collects data out to 12 months after the second vaccination,” said Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, during the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-04-Shimabukuro.pdf"&gt;meeting last week&lt;/a&gt;. Any serious side effects reported through v-safe could trigger a follow-up call from experts in the call center at VAERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clPpUV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCNJh3"&gt;Asking people to access the system through a QR code, though, may leave it vulnerable. Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site, and QR codes could be posted online. Anyone picking up that sheet of paper or finding the code could register and submit false responses to the system, unnamed officials told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post. &lt;/em&gt;The anti-vaccine movement organizes online, and officials worry those groups could flood the system. Verification of concerning reports would be time consuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb5TWQ"&gt;In a statement to the &lt;em&gt;Post, &lt;/em&gt;the CDC said the system, “is in the final stage of development, which includes security testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcnJ3l"&gt;The simplicity of the program has benefits, and unlike other vaccine safety reporting systems, could collect information from people who don’t directly seek medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gShTpG"&gt;“With any widely available technology, there’s an opportunity for people to use spoofing and other nefarious techniques,” said Ed Simcox, former chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. “That would undermine what is so potentially valuable about this system — going directly to patients, or citizens, to get their feedback about multiple vaccines administered in diverse settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2K51hH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google’s COVID contact tracing tech is finally coming to their home state of California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KgYcPpAYyppTXI5dXs4jNWVGPyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473379/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQmGdz"&gt;After a month of testing on university campuses, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1336006920923013122"&gt;California’s governor just announced&lt;/a&gt; that the state is launching its &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/"&gt;COVID contact tracing app&lt;/a&gt; to the public this Thursday, December 10th. The app is called CA Notify, and its launch makes California &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/coronavirus/states-with-contact-tracing-apps/758717/"&gt;the 18th state&lt;/a&gt; (plus Washington, DC) to release a contact tracing app. It’s also the largest to have done so since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;technology was announced&lt;/a&gt; in April. The first app of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355500/virginia-apple-google-contact-tracing-app-covid-alabama"&gt;released in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; back in August, so it’s been quite a long time coming, especially considering California is home to Apple and Google, the two companies that developed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;contact tracing technology&lt;/a&gt; the app uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSNLgb"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have tweeted in support of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dOJSYC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we work together to fight the rise in cases in California, exposure notifications will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and put our neighbors’ health first. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; for helping bring CA Notify to Californians while putting privacy at the very center. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD"&gt;https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1336026658201997318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z33EIl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;California is facing one of its biggest challenges yet in its fight against COVID-19. CA Notify with the exposure notification technology we developed with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; will be a helpful tool as we work together to slow the spread. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; for your leadership. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb"&gt;https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1336010297883066368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gfRhj"&gt;The app uses the contact tracing API that was added to iOS and Android back in May, and it requires an iPhone with iOS 14.2 or a phone running Android 6.0 or above with Bluetooth Low Energy. Basically, your phone will automatically exchange a private key with another phone if they’re within Bluetooth range. (The key doesn’t contain location or any personally identifying information.) When someone tests positive, they can press a button to send a notification to every other person using the app whose phone virtually bumped into theirs, letting them know that they should get tested and quarantine. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth noting that the exposure notification won’t include any information about who exposed whom or when and where it happened. It will only say that you’ve been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7K8rN"&gt;If you have an Android phone, the CA Notify app will be available on December 10th for download on the Google Play Store. California’s site &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/#section4"&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone users, but it’s pretty simple: go to the Settings app then to Exposure Notifications. Tapping “Turn on Exposure Notifications” will let you select California as your region and turn on the tracing. (iPhone owners won’t need a separate app.) It also seems like iPhone users will be able to turn it on before the official launch, as shown in the tweet bellow. I’ve tested it, and it does let you add it, but warns you that “you will not be able to share a COVID-19 Diagnosis with other users until CA Notify is fully enabled statewide”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iypq5x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;br&gt;If you live in California, and have an iPhone running iOS 14.2 or newer, you can turn on Exposure notifications ahead of the official launch this Thursday. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/zsMA1w2Af5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zsMA1w2Af5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ericjboyd (@ericjboyd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericjboyd/status/1336045941288095745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZeafs"&gt;Since California is home to the tech companies behind the tracing technology, I’m hoping we’ll see a high rate of adoption. It’s just unfortunate that it’s taken seemingly tech-forward states like California (which is currently seeing a spike in cases) this long to roll out the app. Washington state, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/more-than-1-million-sign-up-for-covid-19-exposure-app-in-washington-state/281-45e39f68-2663-49f4-a8e9-ef0ac8398a6d"&gt;just rolled out its app last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzRO87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 5:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet showing how you can turn on exposure notifications early on iOS if you live in California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Blade 15 Base model is just $1,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 15 Base sits on a stand on a table with a pair of headphones and a mouse." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leQolvdkLYpUJeJk_sX0lHli2q0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473475/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model___GTX_1660_Ti__Late_2020__Setup.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUVaxL"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 is one of the best 15-inch gaming laptops. It’s far from a budget purchase, but Razer has released the most affordable model you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4qnBu"&gt;As of today, there’s a new &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; model up for preorder that is just $1,499. It’ll ship on December 25th. The model includes a Core i7-10750H, 15.6-inch 120Hz screen, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage, plus an open M.2 slot. For ports, you’ll get two USB 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, and an HDMI 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfMdD4"&gt;Note: these are almost the exact same specs as the $1,599 Blade 15 Base that you can already buy. The biggest difference is that more expensive model has a 144Hz display. As of this writing, that model is on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03289E21-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,499&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. That means there’s little reason to preorder the upcoming Base model when you can get a better screen right now for the same amount of money. (Both of those prices will likely change down the line.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uWZMnNurDUy_p2ZtqZCUzfTzpkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151755/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model_GTX_1660_Ti__Late__2020__01.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="vPwpsI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced review: runs fast, runs hot","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pKR4gF"&gt;Another thing to note is the storage. Let’s face it, 256GB is not a lot of storage for a gaming laptop. You won’t be able to fit a ton of titles on there. The expandable storage means the 256GB is more forgivable, but you’ll still need to go through the hassle of buying an additional drive if you plan to upgrade. Alternatively, a Blade 15 Base with a 512GB SSD is currently on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03286E22-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599 on Razer’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which is only $100 more than the base model. As long as it stays at that price, it’s certainly better value. (You’ll also get the 144Hz screen, as well as a GeForce RTX 2060, and you can buy the model right now rather than having to preorder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw8EJ1"&gt;But if $1,499 really hits the sweet spot for you, and you’ve missed the sale on the 144Hz model, you can preorder the &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Blade 15 Base model&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast extends offer of free Wi-Fi hotspots through June 30th, 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="comcast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yul-6KM4eWRpUy39cofQPGInG0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473280/comcast.1419979278.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLxDP6"&gt;Comcast is extending its COVID-19 support programs &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/covid-support-extended"&gt;through June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, including free access to public Wi-Fi hotspots and discounts on internet service plans. The company says this is the third time it has extended its programs during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ka57rH"&gt;Comcast’s Internet Essentials plan for low-income households is currently free for the first 60 days for new subscribers. With this extension that offer will be available through June 2021. Additionally, access to free Xfinity WiFi hotspots will be extended as well, regardless if you’re a Xfinity subscriber or not. Comcast’s “Lift Zones” — its name for local community centers wired with Comcast internet — are also continuing as an ongoing project. Lift Zones are meant to reach low-income students who might have inconsistent internet access at home. Switching to remote learning or a combination of in-person and online instruction has made internet access critical for students, so having a place to log on that’s theoretically close to home helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5wXPV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Switching to remote learning has made internet access critical for students&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="34RGdj"&gt;Comcast isn’t alone in offering discounts during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Finternet%2Faccess%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Access from AT&amp;amp;T” program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers discounted internet service for families that participate in certain government assistance programs, was expanded to include families that meet a basic income eligibility during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T is also waiving data overage fees for all of its home internet plans, though both changes are currently slated to end on December 31st, 2020. Verizon’s offerings are slightly different. The company has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fupdate-verizon-serve-customers-covid-19&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $20 discount on monthly payments for new Fios subscribers&lt;/a&gt; who qualify for the Federal Communications Commission’s low-income Lifeline discount program, along with 60 days of free router rentals. Sign-ups are accepted through the end of 2020, and customers can keep the discount as long as they qualify, according to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbPbhP"&gt;All three companies signed on to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178451/fcc-coronavirus-keep-americans-connected-pledge-att-comcast-charter-att"&gt;“Keep Americans Connected” pledge&lt;/a&gt; created by the FCC in March when the main focus at the time was not terminating internet service for 60 days, whether or not customers were able to pay their bills. Those 60 days have long been up, and despite the pandemic continuing to infect wide swaths of the country, there’s currently no equally expansive measure to protect customers. AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast are all offering ways to maintain your connection — but not without subscribers taking action first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDBX2L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article suggested that “Lift Zones” were also being extended through June 30th, 2021. Lift Zones are an ongoing project with no end date. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC awards SpaceX $886 million for satellite internet network</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzNvoC"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-368588A1.pdf"&gt;announced $9.2 billion in awards&lt;/a&gt; to companies providing broadband internet to rural areas across the US, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX was one of the biggest winners. The company will receive $886 million over the next 10 years for its Starlink satellite broadband project, under the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaVfWg"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s constellation of satellites that will fly at low altitudes around the Earth, providing internet on the ground below. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317082/spacex-falcon-9-starlink-blacksky-rideshare-launch-time-visor-watch-live"&gt;SpaceX already has launched&lt;/a&gt; 900 of the planned 12,000 satellites needed for the Starlink system into low-Earth orbit.

&lt;p id="99Pj40"&gt;Other big winners in the FCC auction included LTD Broadband, which will get  $1.3 billion; Charter Communications, which will receive $1.2 billion; and the Rural Electric Cooperative Consortium, which is getting $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s fraught and deadly pursuit of self-driving cars is over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGkruYQlihoV3tvv9WkPJ-AmZAA=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68472998/__CA9908_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qX93lZ"&gt;Uber is selling its autonomous vehicle business to Aurora Innovations, a San Francisco-based startup founded by the former head engineer of Google’s self-driving car project, the two companies announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUknaS"&gt;As part of the deal, Aurora’s self-driving cars will eventually operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform. Uber will invest $400 million in Aurora and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join the startup’s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYMTLE"&gt;It’s unclear whether the acquisition will result in any layoffs. “Aurora has committed to making offers to the majority of ATG employees,” an Uber spokesperson said. “We are working through the details with Aurora and will notify our teams in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu8vzv"&gt;The deal marks the end of Uber’s ambitious dream of replacing it’s fleet of human-powered taxis with robot drivers. The ride-hailing company believed that by pouring millions of dollars into developing its own technology, it could eliminate its main cost factor — drivers — and take over the world of transportation with cheap, plentiful autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6juUR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal marks the end of Uber’s fraught pursuit of a fleet of robot taxis to replace its human-powered one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tidyDF"&gt;Instead, Uber faced one disaster of its own making after another. The company was sued by Waymo for allegedly stealing the Google offshoot’s trade secrets. The companies eventually settled, but Uber’s former star engineer (and ex-Googler) Anthony Levandowski was recently sentenced to 18 months in jail for the crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvvjNz"&gt;More troubling than that, though, was the death of Elaine Herzberg in March 2018. The 49-year-old woman was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber vehicle while walking her bike across the street in Tempe, Arizona. It was likely the first known fatality by an autonomous vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GotU3P"&gt;After a lengthy investigation, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972584/uber-fault-self-driving-crash-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board split the blame&lt;/a&gt; between Uber, the safety driver, the victim, and the state of Arizona in a blistering official report that also took the federal government to task for failing to properly regulate the industry. The company was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by local authorities. Uber settled a lawsuit with Herzberg’s family for an undisclosed sum. Police later filed criminal charges against Uber’s safety driver, claiming she wasn’t watching the road but was instead streaming &lt;em&gt;The Voice &lt;/em&gt;on her phone at the time of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI9KDC"&gt;After the crash, Uber resumed testing its self-driving cars but in a much diminished capacity. The company’s Volvo SUVs were only allowed to operate in a closed loop in downtown Pittsburgh, where the Advanced Technologies Group is headquartered. The company recently unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662626/uber-volvo-self-driving-car-safety-autonomous-factory-level"&gt;its third-generation vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to begin testing in Washington, DC, and its hometown of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMQFYe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the coronavirus pandemic has pulled the rug out from under Uber&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="khhpOb"&gt;But the coronavirus pandemic has pulled the rug out from under Uber, which has never had a profitable quarter in its existence. With the evaporation of demand of its ride-hailing business, Khosrowshahi has been pushing to sell off the money-losing parts of the business in his pursuit of profitability. Most recently, Uber reportedly sold its air taxi division to a California-based startup called Joby Aviation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxmxiU"&gt;Aurora is an interesting choice for a buyer. The startup was founded in 2016 by former lead engineer for Google’s self-driving project Chris Urmson. His co-founders are Sterling Anderson, who helped lead Tesla’s Model X project, and Drew Bagnell, who ran a research lab at Carnegie Mellon then left to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber. The company is pursuing autonomous semi trucks (which Uber was also working on but eventually abandoned) as well as self-driving taxis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO7abD"&gt;To date, Aurora has raised $690 million in funding, and Urmson has been hailed as the &lt;a href="https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-aurora-a-safe-path-to-scale-autonomous-vehicles-bd0680fa4fe0"&gt;“Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles,”&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his work helping to pioneer Google’s self-driving car initiative. Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, and EV startup &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/aurora-will-power-byton-evs-autonomous-driving-features/"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt; are also Aurora customers. The company raised half a billion dollars last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215575/amazon-innovation-self-driving-car-startup-google-tesla-executives"&gt;in a funding round led by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvemQm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;This year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B08LX6M79Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is by far the most adorable smart speaker on the market right now. The Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version, but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audio books and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LY7VXZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you purchase it on Amazon, you can also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shape design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;If you are looking for just one Amazon Echo, it is down to its lowest price ever of $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $140&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $60 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device for at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;Last year, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYZJ868?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds, plus six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited, for just $80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a new Echo Studio, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Health care is coming to grips with its pollution problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An ambulance drives down a road in Brooklyn on December 01, 2020 in New York City.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16NbqPvK7BvkE1_DqfM4F0klQHk=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68472975/1288910280.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukc6hl"&gt;Pollution from the health care industry is harming the communities it serves, says a study published today in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you count up how many fewer healthy years people in the US lived as a result of all the pollution the industry pumped out in 2018, it would add up to a collective sum of 388,000 years, the research found. That’s similar to the number of years of life lost due to preventable medical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j86AaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wBFkX3"&gt;“I feel like I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and lead author of another article also published in &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; today that urges health care policymakers to consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;threats posed by climate change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zj1hwm"&gt;Salas is already seeing the effects in her practice, from older adults suffering from heat strokes to patients struggling to breathe because of pollution and &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/climate-change-and-allergies/#:~:text=Burning%20fossil%20fuels%20releases%20carbon,can%20make%20allergy%20symptoms%20worse."&gt;seasonal allergies&lt;/a&gt; that have gotten worse as the planet heats up. “I can try to open their lungs back up with treatments in the emergency department,” Salas said. “But then I send them back out into the very same environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8eTOX"&gt;The problem is only growing over time, with greenhouse gas emissions from health care rising 6 percent between 2010 and 2018. That’s why health care providers are increasing pressure on their industry to tackle its environmental footprint. The new research is part of an entire December issue of &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;climate change and public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rX5mEX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwqeF1"&gt;Overall, health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The biggest source of health care pollution was its supply chain, which accounted for 82 percent of health care-associated emissions. That means the way medicines, medical supplies, and equipment are made could be contributing to pollution that’s making people sick. The numbers in the study on greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollutants are estimates based on how much money health systems spent on goods and services. Since this method doesn’t account for gases used for anesthesia that escape operating rooms, the true environmental footprint could be even larger. Anesthetic gases are &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/anesthesia-greenhouse-gas/"&gt;even more potent&lt;/a&gt; than carbon dioxide when it comes to heating up the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXCjQR"&gt;Instead of simply sending patients back out to an unhealthy environment, health care providers need to step up and eventually eliminate their contributions to climate change, Salas tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Salas and the authors of the emissions study both recommend that Medicaid offer incentives to health care providers to cut down pollution. Medicaid reimbursements, for example, could be tied to climate efforts in the same way they were tied to efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690142/"&gt;desegregate hospitals&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. The emissions study also recommends mandating that health care systems report on how much pollution they’re generating and make plans to cut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNUmO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The health care system should be the first.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNNTxs"&gt;England is the only country in the world that mandates reporting already, according to the study. In October, England’s National Health Service declared that it would become the first national system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497815/uk-nhs-national-health-service-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;to slash emissions to net zero&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzENfn"&gt;“I personally believe that the health care system should be the first to try to reach net zero [carbon dioxide emissions] because we have to practice what we preach,” Salas says. The global economy needs to get to net zero emissions — a combination of cutting down pollution as much as possible and then offsetting whatever is left — by the middle of the century to avoid the worst effects of climate change, according to climate scientists. “Climate action is a prescription for health; we have to lead and fulfill that prescription for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtH1Gq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
