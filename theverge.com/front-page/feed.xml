    <title>Ford recalls Mustang Mach-Es over risk of glass roof flying off</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l80R44"&gt;Ford is recalling the Mustang Mach-E out of concern that the windshield and panoramic roof could leak or, worse, come flying off during a crash or while driving. Nearly 18,000 of the electric SUVs sold to date are at risk of the former, though Ford says only around 13,000 of them run the risk of the roof detaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjAEyo"&gt;The company will start providing owners with recall instructions in late October, and it says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Ford initially started recalling Mustang Mach-E SUVs last week in Canada, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5svfw"&gt;Ford told the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/FORD/MUSTANG%252520MACH-E/SUV/AWD#recalls"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it had become aware that the windshield and panoramic roof of the Mustang Mach-E may not be properly bonded to the car. The company said it does not yet know the cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4QVES"&gt;The recall is just the latest hiccup in the rollout of the Mustang Mach-E, which is the Detroit automaker’s first mass-market electric car. Ford recalled dozens of the first Mach-Es sold in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;after discovering loose subframe bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the first deliveries were delayed, too, while the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;tightened up its quality checks&lt;/a&gt;. Some early vehicles were also plagued by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;software problem that led to the 12-volt battery dying&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiKktf"&gt;Panoramic glass roofs have become a popular feature in new electric vehicles, especially after Tesla started making them standard on its cars. Tesla is familiar with the problem Ford is running into now, too, as the company dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502379/tesla-modely-roof-flies-off-convertible-quality-issue"&gt;glass roof problems&lt;/a&gt; with the Model Y SUV, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/second-tesla-model-y-owner-reports-roof-issue-glass-adhesion-2020-10"&gt;one that literally blew off on the highway&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Ford’s head of electric vehicles even took an indirect shot at Tesla after this happened, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/ford-recalls-mustang-mach-e-risk-of-glass-roof-falling-off-mocking-tesla-same-issue/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it has passed 1 billion users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFyWKyxAQEu4YpAXcP-ZNZdKxz8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915415/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok has passed 1 billion users | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUsfUE"&gt;TikTok said Monday it has passed 1 billion monthly users. It’s a remarkable number for a platform launched in August 2018 that has been scrutinized by governments — including the US — that are worried about the data collection practices of its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srkr7J"&gt;TikTok’s popularity soared during the pandemic, becoming the most-downloaded app in the world in the first quarter of 2020, with some &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/05/20/inside-the-hunt-for-tiktoks-new-ceo-and-whats-next-for-the-worlds-hottest-app"&gt;315 million downloads&lt;/a&gt; in that quarter alone according to app analytics company SensorTower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IqY9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/chinas-bytedance-tiktok-owner-saw-revenue-surge-111percent-in-2020.html"&gt;ByteDance reportedly saw its 2020 revenue&lt;/a&gt; more than double from the year prior, to $34.3 billion. From its launch to date, SensorTower says TikTok installs have reached 3.2 billion, which includes information from Douyin, the Chinese version of the app. TikTok’s monthly average users in August were up 25 percent from August 2020. In June of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/36Kr-KrASIA/TikTok-creator-ByteDance-hits-425bn-valuation-on-gray-market"&gt;ByteDance was valued&lt;/a&gt; at $425 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUNdUe"&gt;And other apps, seeking to duplicate TikTok’s enormous success, created short-form video products of their own. Facebook-owned &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/76ed0392-a59c-4e20-adeb-2d1e87983ddd"&gt;Instagram launched Reels&lt;/a&gt; last August; Snapchat introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;in-app TikTok clone Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; in November, and even video behemoth YouTube got into the short-form game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;debuting its YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt; in the US earlier this year. But TikTok continued growing; a report earlier this month found &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660516/tiktok-average-watch-time-youtube-us-android-app-annie"&gt;TikTok users spend more&lt;/a&gt; time watching its content than YouTube users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WHrjy"&gt;On Monday, TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas thanked users in a video on TikTok for “making TikTok a truly special place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CmdukK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7012606652008402182" data-video-id="7012606652008402182" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;✨ 1 billion✨ people on TikTok! Thank you to our global community  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7012606465961757445"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYSDN3"&gt;ByteDance reportedly postponed its plans for an initial public offering indefinitely amid a crackdown on tech firms by Chinese regulators over the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;past few months&lt;/a&gt;. China is scrutinizing what it considers anti-competitive practices from its big tech firms and how the firms handle customers’ sensitive data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO1KeK"&gt;ByteDance and TikTok were among the Chinese tech firms targeted by the Trump administration last year via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; blocking their apps from US app stores. None of the orders ever took effect, and in June, President Joe Biden signed an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoking the Trump-era bans&lt;/a&gt;. Biden directed the commerce secretary to investigate apps with ties to foreign adversaries like China, that may collect sensitive data from US consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDHibO"&gt;But TikTok also saw some novel bright spots during the pandemic, not the least of which was the fan-made, crowdsourced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; TikTok musical&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a one-off bit based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film that Broadway fans, composers, choreographers, and others added to, one TikTok at a time. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; debuted as a one-night-only streaming concert on January 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210416/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-1-million-actors-fund-disney-pixar-broadway"&gt;raising more than $1 million&lt;/a&gt; for The Actors Fund, which supports performers and workers in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s5h3C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 27th 12:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The first name of TikTok’s COO is Vanessa, not Veronica. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is negotiating with music publishers after settling a copyright lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5JP4nKmdv8WxuS1qUVx2lZ7iI0=/43x0:1663x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915389/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WHnD8"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has settled a lawsuit with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and is negotiating potential deals with individual music publishers. Roblox announced the news this morning, saying it was “committed to partnering with the music industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6B6tS"&gt;The NMPA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued Roblox in June&lt;/a&gt; for letting users upload copyrighted songs into its shared library of game-building assets. Roblox quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;signed individual deals with BMG and Sony&lt;/a&gt;, but the new agreement settles all claims involving NMPA members. According to a press release and the NMPA, Roblox and the organization have agreed to the terms of an industry-wide settlement that individual music publishers can decide whether to opt in to, and the agreement also “opens a negotiation period for members to engage individually in new go-forward licensing deals” with the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nEKGN4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roblox announced new ‘listening parties’ last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9nzws"&gt;Music is a major element of Roblox. The platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;hosted concerts&lt;/a&gt; by artists like Lil Nas X, and &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/09/roblox-launches-listening-parties-new-way-release-music/"&gt;last week, it launched&lt;/a&gt; “listening parties” where artists premiere an album by streaming it across a variety of individual Roblox worlds. But the NMPA accused Roblox of deliberately overlooking or obscuring the range of pirated music on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW0XmR"&gt;Roblox has yet to sign broad-ranging deals that cover users legally adding songs to their experiences — something platforms like YouTube have done — although it offers access to some tracks through &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000927163-Using-Licensed-Music-on-Roblox"&gt;a licensing agreement&lt;/a&gt; with APM Music. While this settlement news doesn’t explicitly discuss those kinds of deals, it seemingly opens the door to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVmpgS"&gt;“Roblox will work closely with the global music publishing industry to help them unlock new ways for music to be more meaningfully integrated into the global Roblox community of more than 48 million daily active users. The deal paves the way for innovative partnerships between Roblox and publishers that will offer songwriters new ways to monetize their songs and catalogues,” a press release says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yA70h8"&gt;This settlement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686404/twitch-national-music-publishers-association-nmpa-agreement-music"&gt;separate NMPA agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Amazon-owned broadcast platform Twitch. That deal was similarly open-ended, but it included an explicit change to how Twitch handles copyright violations, something Roblox and the NMPA’s announcement doesn’t mention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding Director’s Cut makes the most of the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qUguCENQb5zcHfnfTQ5PCU_EUo=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69915169/51298386042_570941bddd_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UuTgs"&gt;Okay, I’ll make the obvious joke: was there really anything cut from &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;? For better and worse, Hideo Kojima’s deeply indulgent post-apocalyptic delivery simulator did not feel like it had been subject to heavy editing. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/12/22573731/death-stranding-directors-cut-hideo-kojima-missions-name-debate"&gt;Kojima himself has said&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t like the name of this new PlayStation 5 version of the game, dubbed a “director’s cut,” arguing instead that it has simply had new content produced for it. So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQBEUp"&gt;In any case, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more worthwhile PS5 upgrades out there. For $10 (if you own the PS4 release), this new edition comes with extra missions, improved visuals and performance, more tools and items, DualSense-powered haptic feedback, and 3D audio support. It all adds up to one of the better showcases of the PS5’s hardware we’ve seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XDkOPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Death Stranding is so good that it shouldn’t have a sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953031/death-stranding-hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-sequel"},{"title":"Death Stranding is a long, bizarre journey that’s both breathtaking and boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JXZwBN"&gt;Already a beautiful game on the PS4, Kojima Productions didn’t have to do a whole lot in order to make &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; seem at home on the PS5. The technical upgrades are largely related to resolution and performance: there’s a 4K quality mode and a slightly less sharp 60fps performance mode, though the former usually sticks to 60fps, and the latter is still fairly high resolution. I normally play games in their performance modes, but a quality mode that doesn’t limit you to 30fps is very welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3jeMm"&gt;Another notable addition is the ability to play the game in an ultrawide aspect ratio. This gives you a wider field of view at the expense of screen real estate — you have black bars on the top and the bottom of your screen, but you can see more of your character’s surroundings. It’s a great fit for &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;’s sweeping vistas. On my 55-inch TV, though, the picture does feel a little small at couch distance. I think the mode would work better on a bigger set — especially if it’s OLED, where the black bars will be less distracting — or for anyone using a smaller TV like the 48-inch LG CX as a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9IW6y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EV53lnCzP1w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v8VBqk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; was the first game I thought of when Sony announced the PS5’s DualSense controller, which has triggers that can provide variable levels of resistance. In &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, you spend a lot of time carrying heavy cargo on your back and using the trigger buttons to balance the load. With the DualSense, the weight is reflected in how difficult it is to pull the trigger, giving you a better indication of when you might end up overexerting yourself and tumbling down a mountain. The increased precision of the haptic feedback also helps convey the feeling of the ground underfoot, as well as weather conditions like rain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; is still the best DualSense demo&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is almost as impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nzFP2"&gt;This release also includes one of the best implementations of 3D audio I’ve heard to date. I’ve found the feature to be a little underwhelming on most PS5 games so far, for all that Sony has touted the console’s Tempest sound engine. But in &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, it really adds to the immersion. Characters speaking in cutscenes sound like they’re accurately placed around you, and you can hear where ghostly enemies are trying to stalk you from. It’s definitely worth playing this one with headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGirKB"&gt;The extra content appears to be quite slight, though I haven’t been able to play through the entire game a second time yet. Many of the additions are typically quirky, from a full-on racing mode to a catapult that lets you launch heavy cargo across the scenery, while there are some more fundamental tweaks like new melee combat moves. I don’t think any of this will change anyone’s mind about the game, but there’s enough new here to make a replay feel fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrnwmM"&gt;A free 60fps patch as seen in games like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; would have been appreciated, but I think the $10 upgrade is worth it for any PS5 owner who enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; on the PS4. At $49.99 for new players, it’s also a reasonable time to get on board with a game that is truly unlike anything else. &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding &lt;/em&gt;certainly isn’t for everyone, and that remains the case here, but with this version, you’re getting a very well-rounded package that makes the most of its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MA1IXp"&gt;The MacBook Pro remains Apple’s top-end option for notebooks with speedy M1 processors. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags"&gt;talks of new models with a rumored M1X update&lt;/a&gt;, but as of now, if you’re looking for the best the M1 has to offer in the shape of a laptop, it’s the late-2020 MacBook Pro. Today, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1753149462504113622#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,150 with 256GB of storage or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,350 for 512GB&lt;/a&gt;. This is the second-best price of all time on the popular laptop from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw6COf"&gt;We often offer praise for its MacBook Air counterpart, which goes on sale more often and is still &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $850&lt;/a&gt;, but the MacBook Pro is a great upgrade for those seeking a bit more performance with a better, brighter screen. You also get the touchbar with the Pro model, a polarizing feature for some, but while it has that holdover from prior generation Intel-based Macs, we’re thankfully well past the butterfly keyboard era — plus it has a proper Escape key. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zPbxfO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Where are Apple’s new Macs? Here’s what we’re still expecting Apple to announce this year   ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="HlfqJn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5swWS8"&gt;In the world of Chromebooks, there are many low-cost options but nothing quite like the Lenovo Chromebook Duet. It’s hands-down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite budget pick in the entire Chromebook world&lt;/a&gt; for its value proposition, and it somehow got even better with a new all-time low price of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1753150478798220762#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This edges out the previous historical low by an additional $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HjFd2"&gt;The Chromebook Duet offers an incredible amount of capability if you want a small machine for light productivity on the go or around the house, and if you appreciate a detachable keyboard form factor. Its replacement, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chromebook Duet 5&lt;/a&gt;, is due out next month. However, with a higher starting price of $430, it will not be seeing sales this good for a long time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UrQQz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3T26M4"&gt;Did you just get a new iPhone 13 or 13 Pro? Are you in need of some chargers, magnetic or otherwise? Amazon has a slew of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/a9f54be4?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_dcell_tlt_0_a9f54be4_dt_slot-15_39f3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; on its Deal of the Day for up to 45 percent off. Its offerings include a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-PowerWave-Compatible/dp/B097Y5PMC4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic charging pad&lt;/a&gt; akin to a MagSafe puck for $20; a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Charging-PowerWave-Magnetic/dp/B094FMWPPM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic 2-in-1 charging stand&lt;/a&gt; for an iPhone 12, 13, or wireless charging AirPods for $27; and even a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-PowerCore-Delivery/dp/B083NPZYXD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10,000mAh power bank&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an 18W USB-C charger for $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrT54R"&gt;For the recent iPhone adopters out there, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Foldable-PowerPort-Included/dp/B08T67HDH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W USB-C charger&lt;/a&gt; ($12) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-PowerWave-Compatible/dp/B097Y5PMC4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;magnetic wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt; ($20) together for less than one MagSafe puck — sans charger — from Apple. The only thing to keep in mind if you’re going this route or opting for the 2-in-1 stand is that the maximum charging output to the phone will be 7.5W and not the full 15W of Apple’s MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DoukGj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10775923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6A7Cm"&gt;Also available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/79d41d02?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_dcell_tlt_1_79d41d02_dt_slot-15_39f3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Deal of the Day&lt;/a&gt; is up to 57 percent off on the August Smart Lock Pro (third-generation). This is the slightly older model smart lock from August, which requires a plug-in Connect hub, but you can get it for a new all-time low price of $99 in either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0752V8D8D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark gray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikXmDw"&gt;One of the Smart Lock Pro’s helpful features is that it works with your existing deadbolt, minimizing the amount of work required to smarten up the entry of your home. There is also an optional keypad bundle, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Connect-technology/dp/B0846DCVJ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $159 today&lt;/a&gt;, for access via code entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UOQAKe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10775970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R8qDIQ"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22690309/amazon-fall-hardware-event-rumors-news-announcements" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon fall hardware event about to take place&lt;/a&gt;, and with it might come a cavalcade of new products, which is why we might be seeing such good deals on products like the August Smart Lock Pro and Amazon’s own first-gen Echo Show 5. The latter is the smallest Echo Show smart display that was released in 2019 and is now available for its best price ever: just $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76526131%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals092721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bttrGt"&gt;The Echo Show 5 is perfect as a bedside alarm clock, in the kitchen, or even as a bathroom countertop music and media player — since the built-in camera can be blocked by a physical shutter. It’s a helpful little smart display that can fit just about anywhere and is quite capable, thanks to its bright touchscreen and loud speakers. There is especially a lot to like for this new low price of $45. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music’s new Wear OS app is coming to older smartwatches after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scsn2o9zrSMFeCO3evBFGBk801w=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914927/4._YouTube_Music.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Wear OS app for YouTube Music.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqxiAT"&gt;YouTube Music’s Wear OS app is rolling out to a handful of older Wear OS 2 smartwatches from the likes of Fossil, Michael Kors, and Mobvoi starting this week, after previously launching exclusively on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642047/google-youtube-music-wear-os-3-app-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;Samsung’s new Wear OS 3-powered Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The app lets YouTube Music Premium subscribers download songs to compatible smartwatches and listen to music offline without needing a paired phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZEED"&gt;The new app was first detailed when Google and Samsung announced they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging their Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to create Wear OS 3, and initial reports suggested it &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;wouldn’t be coming&lt;/a&gt; to devices running the older Wear OS 2 operating system. However, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621394/spotify-wear-os-2-app-offline-playback-smartwatch"&gt;Spotify’s offline support on Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;, the new YouTube Music app will now be available for a broader selection of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y3vOsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Initial reports suggested it would be exclusive to new Wear OS 3 watches&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCvHZ"&gt;The app will be downloadable from the Google Play Store on compatible devices and supports Google’s Smart Downloads feature, which automatically refreshes the songs downloaded for local playback when connected to Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx6k83"&gt;Google says the app will be available this week for Fossil and Michael Kors’ Gen 6 lineup of smartwatches, as well as Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular / LTE, and TicWatch E3. More Wear OS 2 smartwatches are getting the app later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are our favorite MagSafe-compatible cases for the iPhone 13 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xPF2ZE"&gt;Now that your brand-spanking-new iPhone 13 has arrived (or is on the way), it’s time to start thinking about protecting your baby. After all, it’s only a matter of time before your phone falls out of your pocket or makes contact with your keys, so it’s worth the extra investment now to prevent future damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CujTbM"&gt;Although MagSafe as an iPhone accessory standard is already a year old, Apple is off to a slow start building out its accessory ecosystem. Since its October 2020 launch event, Apple has only launched a dozen official MagSafe products: from the iconic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; puck to the 2021 &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM0Q3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Leather Wallet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KebrqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"},{"title":"The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3z5diJ"&gt;Of course, third-party accessory makers are eager to make MagSafe products, too. Unfortunately, Apple is famously tight-fisted with its proprietary technology, even though its &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; is designed to license and control these very products. So third-party accessories like battery packs and chargers can only attach to the official MagSafe products and charge at 7.5W, rather than the 15W wireless charging standard that Apple-approved accessories can achieve. But third-party accessories tend to be cheaper in price and offer more selection than the official lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34HE13"&gt;In case you’re on the hunt for cases that will work with your official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, here are the top 10 third-party iPhone 13 cases that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric car company Polestar is going public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRDEXpyuZZQTSR0obIvA3OLBZxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914754/ahawkins_20210321_4490_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zqN3UU"&gt;Polestar, the Swedish electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, is going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Polestar is the latest EV company — and futuristic transportation company — to go public via a reverse merger with a so-called “blank check” company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyT7pl"&gt;By merging with a company backed by billionaire and “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-with-more-spacs-than-anyone-11620120600"&gt;serial SPAC backer&lt;/a&gt;” Alec Gores and investment bank Guggenheim Partners, Polestar says it will have an “enterprise value” of $20 billion. The deal will also net Polestar a lot of cash: $800 million from Gores Guggenheim’s trust account and $250 million in cash from private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing “anchored by top-tier institutional investors,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQrV3U"&gt;Those other investors include “Volvo Car Group and affiliates of Geely Chairman Eric Li,” and actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio, among others, Polestar says. It is the biggest blank-check merger in the EV sector since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;Lucid Motors struck a $24-billion deal&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ktMnhq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nVf30"&gt;The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;spun out of Volvo in 2016&lt;/a&gt; as its performance sub-brand but has since recast itself as an EV-only marque. Polestar is jointly owned by Volvo and the automaker’s Chinese parent company, Geely. It’s truly an automaker with dual citizenship, with a headquarters based in Gothenburg and an assembly line in Chengdu. Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Polestar 3, an electric crossover SUV, is expected to be revealed in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r6iptg"&gt;Polestar is the latest EV company to go public by SPAC, joining others like Faraday Future, Lordstown Motors, and Lucid Motors. Polestar is distinct from those companies, though, in that it has actually sold its vehicles to customers. The company is the latest in a growing line of EV startups, autonomous vehicle companies, and automotive suppliers to go public by merging with “blank check” companies, which are publicly listed investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OARJ0O"&gt;There have been some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;noticeable flops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;Lordstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; are among the EV companies that have hit some speed bumps after going public. There is a sense that in rushing to take advantage of the SPAC boom, these startups have been left to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrAkBt"&gt;Polestar may have an easier time, though, thanks to its connections to major automakers like Volvo and Geely. The company says it delivered about 10,000 vehicles last year and expects to sell about 290,000 vehicles per year by 2025, with plans to launch three new models by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYDb21"&gt;Post-merger, the combined company will be named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Ltd. and will trade under the symbol “PSNY” on the Nasdaq stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 review: ninth time’s the charm</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Lenovo has nailed the ThinkPad formula&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UOpv2C"&gt;It makes me feel very old to say this, but we are on the ninth generation of Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon. And there have been nine of these for a reason. The X1 Carbon has historically been one of the best business laptops you can get. And that remains the case with its newest iteration. Lenovo has made a few tweaks, but otherwise, it’s the same ThinkPad excellence we’ve come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COATVp"&gt;Before we get into the pricing, I need to make the usual caveat that Lenovo loves to put absurdly high MSRPs on all of its ThinkPads, but they’re usually available for significantly less. So the base X1 Carbon (the Linux model) has an MSRP of $2,336 but is currently available for $1,401.60. That model includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), 256GB of storage, and a 1920 x 1200, 14-inch, 400-nit, non-touch display. Prebuilt models run up to a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $3,479 (listed at $2,249.40). You can add an infrared camera, as well as a touchscreen with Lenovo’s Privacy Guard or a UHD+ panel, but those options are only available with the IR webcam. The IR camera can also come with human presence detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXGnWq"&gt;The specific model I tested is currently listed for $1,829.40 if you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fconfigurator%2Fcto%2Findex.html%3FbundleId%3D20XWCTO1WWUS1%26ecpn%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22691965%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;construct it on Lenovo’s site&lt;/a&gt; ($3.049 MSRP). As a full package, it’s listed for &lt;a href="https://www.cdw.com/product/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-14-core-i7-1165g7-evo-16-gb-ram/6447737"&gt;$2,251.99 at CDW&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sold out there. It has a Core i7-1165G7 (a step down from the most expensive chip), 16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, a non-touch display, no vPro, and no IR camera. It is verified through Evo, which is the program Intel uses to certify top-performing models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lx7glP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771588"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kyZxhF"&gt;The ThinkPad’s biggest update from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Carbon Gen 8&lt;/a&gt; is the new 16:10 display, a feature Lenovo has been adding to X-series ThinkPads across the line. It affords noticeably more vertical screen space than you’ll see from the 16:9 Carbon Gen 8, which means less scrolling and less zooming out while multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaCDEe"&gt;Aspect ratio aside, the screen on this device is quite good. It has a 1920 x 1200 resolution and comes with a new technology that’s supposed to reduce blue light exposure. My unit was slightly dim for the category, maxing out at 297 nits (it’s rated for 400), but the matte texture meant I still saw very little glare in bright indoor settings and could work comfortably. The display delivered a good picture with vivid colors, high contrast, and sharp details. The screen covers 99 percent of the sRGB gamut and 87 percent of Adobe RGB, which is good (though not comparable to what you’ll see on something like an OLED panel). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbZftV"&gt;In addition to this display, you can get a 400-nit FHD+ touchscreen model or a brighter 500-nit FHD+ touchscreen option with Lenovo’s Privacy Guard technology, which makes it harder for potential snoops to peek at your screen from the sides. (This option doesn’t have the blue light filter.) Then there’s a UHD+ 500-nit non-touch screen, which &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;include the blue light filter and also supports Dolby Vision. The FHD+ panel is good enough that I don’t think most people should need the UHD one unless brightess is an isuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl4SoHXkaF2W2GV4Xan_jW2p9FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804712/akrales_210824_4723_0080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, lock slot, audio jack on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zomSQ622h_dz5lY1IVzeMnHYSRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804713/akrales_210824_4723_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, a USB-A, and an HDMI on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZRNut"&gt;The second thing that’s been upgraded: the hinge. Put the Gen 9 next to previous ThinkPad X1 Carbon models and you’ll notice that the former now has a single round hinge connecting the display to the keyboard deck. There are communication antennas inside (so it’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;soundbar hinge&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s something). I like this build a little more, and it makes the bottom bezel look a bit less chunky, but folks will likely take their own views. Speaking of that bottom bezel, the visible Lenovo and X1 Carbon logos that adorned that of the previous model are now gone, creating a slightly more refined and less commercial look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt5WjK"&gt;Third change: touchpad is bigger. 10 percent wider, specifically. Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-8-2020"&gt;reviewers felt&lt;/a&gt; that the Gen 8’s was a bit small. I will say that while the extra width is nice, it’s still a bit cramped height-wise (probably because it needs to accommodate a set of ThinkPad-signature discrete clickers), and I did find myself hitting plastic a lot when I scrolled. Everything else about the touchpad is great, though — it has quite a smooth texture and an effortless click. The keyboard is also snappy, though it is a bit loud and the backspace key squeaked on my model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 on a table in front of a bookshelf, open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays a Verge article." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAWMpVpLqD78bCNRnS0aGM91vMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804716/akrales_210824_4723_0131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have a scissor-lift mechanism “to ensure ergonomics and comfort.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zp2tKk"&gt;The X1 Carbon Gen 9 also has an improved Dolby Atmos audio system. There are new upward-firing speakers on each side of the keyboard. The sound was surprisingly good, with particularly forceful percussion and bass. The device comes preloaded with Dolby Access, which you can use to switch between equalizer presets for games, movies, music, and voice calls, as well as custom profiles. These did make a noticeable difference, though I often find that I prefer to listen to music on the Movies profile since the Music profile makes the vocals stand out a bit more than I like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 on a table in front of a bookshelf, facing away from the camera, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhnfrHM5i43Gz3zieMELa77bQRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804714/akrales_210824_4723_0101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four 360-degree far-field microphones as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9gUwI"&gt;Finally, the match-on-chip fingerprint reader is now integrated into the power button (it was previously next to the touchpad). Sure, that’s a slightly more convenient position. The sensor didn’t quite get my fingerprint every time (possibly due to how tiny it now is), but it generally worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sag8BH"&gt;If you’re not a fan of the fingerprint reader, you may want to spring for a model with the IR camera, which supports Windows Hello facial recognition. Human presence detection enables the computer to automatically wake when you’re near it and lock when you move away. I didn’t have one of these fancy cameras, but the regular one on my unit was serviceable enough — I looked grainy on my Zoom calls, but generally accurate. There’s a physical webcam shutter as well, as is standard for ThinkPads of this caliber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JGYltN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10771614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvlOQq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Carbon is absolutely up there with Dell’s XPS as one of the best-built laptops you can buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="h9gjj4"&gt;Elsewhere, the Carbon Gen 9 has a heck of a lot in common with previous X1 Carbon models. It has the same beautiful black chassis with all of the signature ThinkPad features, from the red TrackPoint to the unique keyboard layout. (Remember: Fn and Ctrl are reversed on ThinkPads.) It’s unbelievably thin and light (2.49 pounds, 0.59 inches) while still being quite durable; Lenovo says it’s undergone MILSpec durability testing. The X1 Carbon is absolutely up there with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS&lt;/a&gt; as one of the best-built laptops you can buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFqukR"&gt;Inside, the X1 Carbon now includes 11th Gen Intel processors with Iris Xe integrated graphics across the board. My test model was a great multitasker, with no problem running Zoom calls on top of Spotify streams on top of heaps of Chrome tabs. Intel’s Core i7-1165G7 delivers some of the best performance you’ll find from a laptop of this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8d0cL"&gt;You wouldn’t want to rely on the Iris Xe GPU for anything super graphics-heavy, but it can lend a hand with all kinds of general video playback, multimedia work, and computational tasks. I got through editing a batch of photos just fine. Anyone who plans on doing a lot of gaming has access to similarly priced and similarly built options with GPUs, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GYLeZy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10771620"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LlYrE5"&gt;For some raw numbers, the ThinkPad took 10 minutes and 22 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That’s about 20 seconds faster than the XPS 13 with the same processor took to complete the same task. It was over two minutes slower than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and took over twice as long as the Dell XPS 15 with a GTX 1650, just to illustrate how much an entry-level GPU can add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUsK7k"&gt;I wasn’t able to run the Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro because it kept freezing. Lenovo is looking into the problem but hasn’t figured out the cause yet. In the meantime, the X1 Carbon tends to score mid-200s (&lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=56480"&gt;248, most recently&lt;/a&gt;) on this test. That also doesn’t approach the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=55783"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it does beat the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the ThinkPad’s graphics performance doesn’t top the category, but it’s solidly in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfXWrT"&gt;I didn’t encounter any bothersome fan noise while using the X1 Carbon. I also had no problem using the device on my lap — it got toasty but never uncomfortably so. The touchpad and palm rests were always downright cool, even under fairly intense loads. No complaints on that front, which is commendable for such a thin device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvZJKD-k_ylJrSYrLu8Ner8Vnxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804707/akrales_210824_4723_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That trusty TrackPoint remains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ja9fA7"&gt;Finally, the ThinkPad’s battery (while running my dozen-tab-plus workload with frequent YouTube and Spotify in the background around 200 nits of brightness) varied a bit based on settings. I consistently got over 10 hours of juice when I was on the Battery Saver profile and had Intel’s battery-saving features on, but I could see as low as five with a more powerful performance profile. I saw an overall average of eight hours and 43 minutes, which is respectable — better than the XPS 15, where I only averaged around six hours, but worse than the XPS 13, where I averaged over nine. I didn’t see any performance penalty from the Battery Saver profile, so I’d use that if you need all-day juice. Also a benefit: The ThinkPad doesn’t ship with McAfee or other crapware that can eat into battery life on consumer models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xES0QJXKpipHpI_ut-YkzTjDSWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804719/akrales_210824_4723_0158.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks like a ThinkPad, runs like a ThinkPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SkEh4C"&gt;Apart from the dim screen (and the lack of an option brighter than 500 nits, when a number of business models now offer 1,000-nit options), the still-slightly-cramped touchpad, and the squeaky keyboard, I have very few complaints about this X1 Carbon. Its price is quite high, of course, so those nitpicks still do give me some pause.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qgw9L3"&gt;Lenovo’s new additions — particularly the 16:10 screen and the upward-firing speakers — are absolutely welcome, and they make the X1 Carbon Gen 9 unquestionably the best iteration of this device so far. It’s a formula Lenovo has perfected to a tee, combining the ThinkPad line’s world-class engineering with exactly the tweaks it needed to stay excellent in the modern market. While the X1 Carbon isn’t the best value for consumers, any deep-pocketed business shopper should give it a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s fall hardware event 2021: rumors, news, and announcements </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Expect new product announcements on September 28th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ktvj5R"&gt;When Amazon announces new products in the fall, it often does it in bulk — fitting for a retailer, maybe, but harder to discern what’s what and which new products are most worthy of your attention. The Verge will try and help with that. We anticipate Amazon announcing a variety of new products coming to its Echo, Fire, and Ring lineups on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIt7I2"&gt;Amazon has already been making some waves with recent announcements of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;its own line of TVs&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;new flagship Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt;. Yet we’re sure to see plenty more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X48Fhn"&gt;But even if Amazon has already made some notable announcements prior to this event, don’t forget how expansive its products are, from Ring to August smart locks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663811/amazon-luna-fire-tablet-chromebook-family-retro-channels"&gt;game streaming&lt;/a&gt; and actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;video game development&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent rumors encompass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691287/amazon-echo-alexa-devices-wall-mounted-soundbar-auto-robot"&gt;a wall-mounted Echo, Alexa-powered soundbars, a second-generation Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
