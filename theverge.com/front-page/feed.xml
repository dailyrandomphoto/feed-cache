    <title>Grubhub will use Russian-made robots to deliver food on college campuses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TO-_5-2J1gun8PXu1PKtINdH5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550815/YanexRoverDeliveryMI_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p4Nktj"&gt;Grubhub and Russian self-driving startup Yandex are teaming up to use robots to deliver food on US college campuses. It represents the latest deal that envisions hundreds of six-wheeled self-driving robots that essentially act as roving lunchboxes in cities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLiXV"&gt;The robot-powered delivery service won’t kick off until this fall when college students return to campus. Yandex, which is often described as Russia’s Google, will operate the robots, as well as handle the entire food delivery process. Grubhub, which has partnerships with over 250 college campuses in the US, will serve as the platform for the delivery transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AAV6pn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating delivery workers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y87zhx"&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating the delivery worker from the equation as a potential benefit from the deal with Yandex — though neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership. “We’re excited to offer these cost-effective, scalable and quick food ordering and delivery capabilities to colleges and universities across the country that are looking to adapt to students’ unique dining needs,” said Brian Madigan, vice president of corporate and campus partners at Grubhub, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76a5yH"&gt;Yandex says that its delivery robots can navigate pavement, pedestrian areas and crosswalks, and reach campus areas not accessible by car. “Such functionality enables the robots to handle delivery tasks traditionally performed by people and provides efficient last-mile logistics automation,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ7Iso"&gt;Food delivery via robot is nothing new in the US. There are many startups operating delivery robots of varying sizes — everything from fully sized minivans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;like Udelv&lt;/a&gt; to robots that look almost identical to Yandex’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"&gt;Starship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139394/postmates-serve-autonomous-delivery-robot-los-angeles"&gt;Postmates has a delivery robot called Serve&lt;/a&gt; that can carry 50 pounds of cargo. There are even some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265397/nuro-robot-delivery-houston-texas-kroger"&gt;like Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, which has made what can be best described as a mini-robotic car, that fall somewhere in between. All claim to be autonomous, but some require human monitors to track their movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGYR6F"&gt;Demand for delivery robots has skyrocketed since the pandemic, though it remains to be seen whether that holds up as the economy reopens and fewer people rely on takeout from restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXbA2l"&gt;Delivery services view the use of robots as one of the many ways they can cut down on labor costs and achieve profitability. Earlier this year, DoorDash acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics. But most seem to be stuck in the experimental phase, with companies unclear on how exactly to scale up the use of these automated helpers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft is reportedly shaking up Assassin’s Creed with new live-service game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8Jk6JTNN5dRm39_Ecxig8h03a0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550726/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wPUuh"&gt;Ubisoft has officially confirmed the existence of &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game codenamed &lt;/a&gt;“&lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;,” after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/assassin-s-creed-infinity-to-offer-live-online-game-service?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the new online service-based game. While Ubisoft’s announcement doesn’t shed much light on what form the new game will take, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that it will be an evolving online game similar to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs1XUu"&gt;Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;marks what is likely to be the biggest change in the franchise’s history since its debut in 2007. Until now, Ubisoft has tended to release a new standalone &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game once every one or two years, each focused on a single location and time period. But according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will feature multiple connected settings that may look and play differently, and this number may expand over time. The new game is reportedly years away from release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MuOfxS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A huge change for the franchise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKdcgG"&gt;The title also marks a shift in how Ubisoft develops &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; games, the company says. While previous titles have generally been led alternatively by its teams in Montreal and Quebec City, the new game is being developed under a “collaborative, cross-studio structure” between the two studios. “Rather than continuing to pass the baton from game to game, we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft’s most beloved franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner that’s less centered on studios and more focused on talent and leadership, no matter where they are within Ubisoft,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLG1C0"&gt;Development of the title has reportedly been impacted by a recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations that emerged against senior Ubisoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21305018/ubisoft-multiple-employees-administrative-leave-sexual-misconduct"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. Employees are reportedly angry that managers accused of misconduct are still in senior positions within the company. A spokesperson for Ubisoft told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; “Any employee that had allegations and remain at Ubisoft has had their case rigorously reviewed by a third party and were either exonerated or underwent appropriate disciplinary actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzfV4F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0u4Eu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna starts human trials of an mRNA-based flu shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grubb’s Pharmacy..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGQTzAzBbrIl9uuhVjWbdCy5h4Q=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550599/1232272941.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uf8Ys7"&gt;Moderna gave its mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine to the first set of volunteers in a clinical trial, the pharmaceutical company &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The start of the trial marks the next stage of the company’s work on this type of vaccine technology after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;overwhelming success&lt;/a&gt; of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was built using the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="274cru"&gt;Before the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines were still largely experimental, even as they were heralded as &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/coronavirus-help-mRNA-DNA-vaccines/98/i14"&gt;the future&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine development. People who get an mRNA vaccine are injected with tiny snippets of genetic material from the target virus. Their cells use that genetic information to build bits of the virus, which the body’s immune system learns to fight against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ktch"&gt;The high efficacy of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;major endorsement&lt;/a&gt; for this type of vaccine. Now, pharmaceutical companies plan to use this technology to fight other types of infectious diseases, including flu. The flu shots available each year in the United States are usually between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm"&gt;40 and 60 percent&lt;/a&gt; effective. The most common shots are made by growing the influenza virus in cells or chicken eggs, and then killing the virus so it’s no longer dangerous. It takes a long time to grow the virus, so companies have to start making the shots around six months ahead of time, based on predictions around which strain of the flu will be circulating that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt33qK"&gt;Pharmaceutical companies hope that mRNA-based flu vaccines can be more effective than the traditional shots. Because they’d be faster to make, production wouldn’t have to start so far in advance, and they could theoretically be more closely matched with the type of flu spreading each season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbzijl"&gt;Moderna is the second group&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to start testing its mRNA flu shot in human trials — &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/sanofi-translate-bio-start-seasonal-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial-gaining-early-lead-over-moderna"&gt;Sanofi and Translate Bio&lt;/a&gt; kicked off a trial this summer. Pfizer and BioNTech have been interested in mRNA flu shots for &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-pays-biontech-120m-to-form-mrna-flu-vaccine-pact"&gt;a few years&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re pushing forward with those plans &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/covid-vaccines-pfizer-scientist-says-mrna-technology-could-create-more-potent-seasonal-flu-shots.html"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dxkqG"&gt;Moderna says it hopes to eventually create combination vaccines that could protect people against flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections with one shot. “Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWGrAR"&gt;If flu shots using this technology prove to be safe and effective, it could also make us more prepared for a potential pandemic flu in the future. It’s a fairly simple process to design a shot that could target&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a new influenza virus. “[mRNA] gives us a very strong platform for a rapid response,” Rosemary Rochford, an immunologist at the University of Colorado, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Wireless headset includes Game Pass Ultimate at eBay for $107</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RzkjakZ7g_tcYzrMXSx5Dd12c5k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550449/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HutEmf"&gt;Over at eBay, the seller antonline (with a 98.7 percent positivity rating) has Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset in stock. This accessory has been tricky to find in stock, and what’s notable is that the price isn’t inflated. What’s more, you’re getting a better deal here since it includes a free one-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. All in all, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F124796256296%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’ll cost you $107 for the headset and the subscription&lt;/a&gt; (usually $115 together). The eBay listing says “limited quantity available”, so act fast if you want to snag a headset before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T76BgH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;This is the best wireless headset for Xbox owners to get&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs effortlessly with your Xbox One or Series S / X console (as well as PC via a USB adapter that’s not included), and you can also pair a phone to them with Bluetooth. Their easy-to-use dials let you adjust volume and tweak the game / chat audio mix to your liking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbvf2t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxi0dd"&gt;Over at B&amp;amp;H Photo, the last-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro (space gray) with 256GB of storage is discounted. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag it for $949&lt;/a&gt;, down $150 from its usual $1,099 price. That makes for a $250 price difference between the last generation tablet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the latest model that has the faster M1 processor, support for Thunderbolt, and a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;. Those might be nice features to have for some, but for those who don’t want to spend that much, this might be the deal you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C4LZz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTR8X4"&gt;If you want a no-frills M.2 NVMe SSD with 1TB of storage, Best Buy is hosting a deal on SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB model. Normally around $105, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $95 today&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, Best Buy frequently knocks the price down on this SSD, and this isn’t as huge of a price cut as Best Buy makes it seem. Outside of a deal, it usually costs around $120 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBQtIe"&gt;I’ve noted this before in previous deal posts this SSD has appeared in, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;folks on Reddit claim&lt;/a&gt; that this drive lacks DRAM cache, meaning it might struggle with maintaining speed while transferring large files. Still, it’ll likely be a good enough option for people just looking for a good amount of speedy storage without paying too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tDuUR4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cowboy’s excellent third-generation electric bike gets discounted to €1,990</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgJS-P2j5z5hM5m3EcDcb7FSciU=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550260/verge_DSC_0771_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khz54d"&gt;Cowboy’s third generation electric bike, the appropriately named Cowboy 3, has received another discount. Going forward, it will now sell for €1,990 (£1,690), €300 cheaper than its original launch price of €2,290. That price includes mudguards, which Cowboy recently started including as standard, as well as free delivery in 10 days. This latest price cut comes a little over two months after Cowboy reduced the price of its third-gen bike to €2,190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wLeUo"&gt;The reason for the price drop is obvious. The Cowboy 3 came out one year ago, and a successor, the Cowboy 4, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;. So yes, you’re getting a slightly older model without the new version’s improved powertrain or integrated wireless charging dock for your phone. But we really liked the Cowboy 3 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;reviewed it last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got helpful features like built-in crash detection, and it’s also remarkably sleek for an electric bike with a removable battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUJ62s"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Cowboy 4 is currently due to ship this fall. It’ll be joined by the Cowboy 4 ST, a version with a step-through frame. Both new bikes will retail for for €2,490 / £2,290.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Office UI now available for testers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2kZR74RcHr8nGtGIEP1HdkMFlk=/138x0:1623x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550146/Zoomed_in_view_of_WXP_in_default_theme_in_SV.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Office UI.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WkGS9"&gt;Microsoft has started testing its new Office design today. The software maker originally teased its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;design changes to Office last year&lt;/a&gt; before revealing last month that Office’s new UI is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554676/microsoft-office-64-bit-arm-windows-11-beta-insider-redesign"&gt;designed to match the redesigned Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; operating system. Office Insiders can now access the new UI for testing before it’s available to all Microsoft 365 users later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6BE4n"&gt;The main changes are a rounded look to the Office ribbon bar, with subtle tweaks to some of the buttons throughout Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft had originally teased more dramatic changes to its Office UI, which included moving toward more of a command bar instead of the traditional ribbon interface. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kw5nSHg3FFqHG-NlqabNzJoqjKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20103664/m365_vision_excel_HD.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has teased bigger UI changes for Office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ozeIAh"&gt;It looks like, for now at least, Microsoft is gradually bringing subtle changes to its Office design rather than fully ditching the ribbon interface. Microsoft is still working on adaptive commanding that will eventually see Office’s ribbon interface replaced with a toolbar that can be undocked to float nearby actions you’re taking in documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYmwuy"&gt;We’re expecting to see those changes appear on the web and mobile versions of Office first, ahead of any significant design overhauls to the main desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft said last year that these changes could take a year or two to roll out, so we’re only starting to see the first changes in time for Windows 11 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIlj9X"&gt;This updated Microsoft Office interface is available for testers on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. You’ll need to be part of the &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders group&lt;/a&gt; and set to receive beta channel updates in Office settings. Once you’ve updated, a megaphone icon at the top of any Office app will let you toggle the new UI on or off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub’s automatic coding tool rests on untested legal ground</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a GitHub logo of a provider of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj3pRhKYa5qUE4yHbhEmIbsXT-c=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550018/1231387819.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItMtla"&gt;Just days after GitHub announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;new Copilot tool&lt;/a&gt;, which generates complementary code for programmers’ projects, web developer Kyle Peacock &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylpeacock/status/1410749018183933952"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an oddity he had noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKOT13"&gt;“I love to learn new things and build things,” the algorithm wrote, when asked to generate an About Me page. “I have a &amp;lt;a href=“https://github.com/davidcelis”&amp;gt; Github&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeEanH"&gt;While the About Me page was supposedly generated for a fake person, that link goes to the GitHub profile of David Celis, who &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can confirm is not a figment of Copilot’s imagination. Celis is a coder and GitHub user with popular repositories, and even formerly worked at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUzXo4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YYRQBj"&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot,” Celis told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that he was amused by the algorithm reciting his name. But while he doesn’t mind his name being spit out by an algorithm that &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;parrots its training data&lt;/a&gt;, Celis is concerned at the copyright implications of GitHub scooping up any code it can find to better its AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGo3"&gt;When GitHub announced Copilot on June 29, the company said that the algorithm had been trained on publicly available code posted to GitHub. Nat Friedman, GitHub’s CEO, has written on forums like &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27678354"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the company is legally in the clear. “Training machine learning models on publicly available data is considered fair use across the machine learning community,” the Copilot page says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ais6Cu"&gt;But the legal question isn’t as settled as Friedman makes it sound — and the confusion reaches far beyond just GitHub. Artificial intelligence algorithms only function due to massive amounts of data they analyze, and much of that data comes from the open internet. An easy example would be &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/"&gt;ImageNet&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most influential AI training dataset, which is entirely made up of publicly available images that ImageNet creators do not own. If a court were to say that using this easily accessible data isn’t legal, it could make training AI systems vastly more expensive and less transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fJLBv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The details change when an algorithm generates media of its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sidyMb"&gt;Despite GitHub’s assertion, there is no direct legal precedent in the US that upholds publicly available training data as fair use, according to Mark Lemley and Bryan Casey of Stanford Law School, who &lt;a href="https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; last year about AI datasets and fair use in the &lt;em&gt;Texas Law Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdB7mk"&gt;That doesn’t mean they are against it: Lemley and Casey write that publicly available data should be considered fair use, for the betterment of algorithms and to conform to the norms of the machine learning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cg2jW"&gt;And there are past cases to support that opinion, they say. They consider the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/technology/google-books-case.html"&gt;Google Books case&lt;/a&gt;, in which Google downloaded and indexed more than 20 million books to create a literary search database, to be similar to training an algorithm. The Supreme Court upheld Google’s fair use claim, on the grounds that the new tool was transformative of the original work and broadly beneficial to readers and authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njyVJS"&gt;“There is not controversy around the ability to put all that copyrighted material into a database for a machine to read it,” Casey says about the Google Books case. “What a machine then outputs is still blurry and going to be figured out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAARqQ"&gt;This means the details change when the algorithm then generates media of its own. Lemley and Casey argue in their paper that if an algorithm begins to generate songs in the style of Ariana Grande, or directly rip off a coder’s novel solution to a problem, the fair use designation gets much murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRPmwe"&gt;Since this hasn’t been directly tested in a court, a judge hasn’t been forced to decide how extractive the technology really is: If an AI algorithm turns the copyrighted work into a profitable technology, then it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for a judge to decide that its creator should pay or otherwise credit for what they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdNq2u"&gt;But on the other hand, if a judge were to decide that GitHub’s style of training on publicly available code was fair use, it would squash the need for GitHub and OpenAI to cite the licenses of the coders that wrote its training data. For instance, Celis, whose GitHub profile was generated by Copilot, says he uses the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which requires attribution for derivative works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKpEg"&gt;“And I fall in the camp that believes Copilot’s generated code is absolutely derivative work,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNAMcb"&gt;Until this is decided in a court, however, there’s no clear ruling on whether this practice is legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWipmf"&gt;“My hope is that people would be happy to have their code used for training,” Lemley says. “Not for it to show up verbatim in someone else’s work necessarily, but we’re all better off if we have better-trained AIs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to fast-forward through a TikTok video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ga0Y7iUpJ7UBfJb7SCL_sgEQwYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550013/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ibhOk"&gt;TikTok videos aren’t what you would call long, but sometimes you might want to skip a few seconds ahead — especially now that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;videos can be up to three minutes long&lt;/a&gt;. Or you may have a favorite moment that you want to replay, over and over and over. Either way, TikTok has recently added a way to go forward and back on its videos. (Note: it’s possible that this feature hasn’t been rolled out to all users yet; if you don’t yet have it yet, it should arrive soon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydh7Et"&gt;When you’re playing a TikTok video, look at the bottom of the video for a faint white line. You will probably not see it in all videos; after some experimenting, I found that I was mainly finding it in the longer videos. If you do see it, then you can use it to go forward and back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Q99wyA"&gt;You should also see a slightly thicker white line progress as the video progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LUOns"&gt;Touch the thicker white line and it will highlight, with a dot at the end indicating how far you are in the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ehjpzS"&gt;Press the dot and use it to move the video ahead or back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hMDi_ra1DjSeN0ANXaIb9D-4po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702174/Screenshot_20210706_154801.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Longer videos will have a line you can use to move forward or back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGJjxdC-1XZzCnOIjNO475LHFyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702176/Screenshot_20210706_150200.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longer videos will have a line you can use to move forward or back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEEUHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 7th, 2021, 9:40AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to mention that not all users may have this feature yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A bigger, better Switch screen is exactly what I wanted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8E7Bw9rRHzDVohygVGo5XCcokg=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69549747/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch will be released this October.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SttNm7"&gt;At least in many of the corners of the internet I’ve been reading all day, the response to the OLED Nintendo Switch has not been all that positive. It’s no surprise, really — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;credible reporting&lt;/a&gt; had suggested a more powerful model with 4K output, but the final product features the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;same internals&lt;/a&gt; as the current Switch. If you prefer to play Nintendo games on your TV, the new version’s bigger OLED screen isn’t going to do anything for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pzizem"&gt;I’m still buying one, though. A proper screen upgrade has been my most-wanted Switch feature ever since the console came out, and now more so than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy2SDF"&gt;I swapped my launch-model Switch for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; when it came out in 2019. Most of the Switch’s appeal is in its portable nature, I figured, so why not go all-in on a sleeker, more compact version with an actual D-pad? Well, turns out there are lots of reasons not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q9uiyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"},{"title":"Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="at7H2s"&gt;The Switch Lite is perfect for a lot of games, but damn near unusable for a bunch of others. The screen is just too dang small to read all the text in &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;, or to make any sense of the action in &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;. Cross-save functionality would make it a great portable &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; machine for when I’m away from my PC, except that I can barely see what’s happening on-screen. And for obvious reasons, you can forget about &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juIp1j"&gt;It’s not like the regular Switch’s 6.2-inch display is vastly bigger, but it does make a difference, and at least there you have the recourse of playing the worst offenders on your TV if need be. The Switch’s biggest strength is the way it runs the same games in TV and handheld modes, but inevitably some titles are going to be better suited to one than the other, and the Switch Lite only gives you one option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEAEX6"&gt;The new OLED Switch should solve the issue altogether. It has a TV dock, of course, but even in handheld mode I’d expect the bigger screen to make the aforementioned games a lot more playable, without causing a noticeable increase in the size of the console itself thanks to slimmed-down bezels. And the OLED panel technology should, in theory, also make them look much better, with deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. The LCD panels in the current Switch models are adequate at best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVTLyKi0ljOaK1hcvE-m98nG3i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703114/E5nez6yXMBcUNZ3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch’s kickstand looks to be much-improved.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgy1vp"&gt;This is mostly just about me regretting the move to the Switch Lite, but I think the OLED Switch could be a solid upgrade from the launch model too. The kickstand looks much improved, and the bigger screen should make it more practical to play local multiplayer games in tabletop mode. And according to Nintendo, you’ll get the same boost to battery life that was introduced with 2019’s refresh to the original Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dep8N5"&gt;I do have some reservations about the OLED Switch. At $350, it feels like a price hike considering the regular Switch has sat at $299 since its 2017 launch. I really hope the screen doesn’t use a PenTile-style sub-pixel matrix commonly found in OLED panels, for example, because that would probably look pretty rough at 720p and 7 inches. (My guess/hope is that it will use a full RGB layout, like the PS Vita did almost ten years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEyaFJ"&gt;Mostly, though, I’m just glad I’ll be able to play more Switch games again. The Lite caused my Switch playtime to fall off a cliff over the last couple of years, and although it is very cute, I’ll be happy to see the back of it.&lt;/p&gt;
