    <title>Mozilla pauses accepting crypto donations following backlash</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C1Aitx"&gt;Mozilla, the nonprofit organization that makes the Firefox web browser, announced Thursday that it would be pausing the ability to accept cryptocurrency donations following significant backlash spurred in part by a Mozilla founder, Jamie Zawinski (&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mozilla-crypto-donations-jamie-zawinski-2022-1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwT6sV"&gt;Zawinski, who stopped working for mozilla.org &lt;a href="https://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html"&gt;in 1999&lt;/a&gt;, tweeted scathing criticism to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1476951030638260225"&gt;December 31st Mozilla tweet&lt;/a&gt; promoting that it accepted cryptocurrency donations. Mozilla began accepting bitcoin for donations &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-now-accepts-bitcoin/"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qROkaC"&gt;“Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776"&gt;Zawinski said&lt;/a&gt; on January 3rd. (Cryptocurrencies have come under significant scrutiny for their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html"&gt;impact on the environment&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that the bulk of supposed crypto wealth seems to currently be available to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-one-percent-controls-lions-share-of-the-cryptocurrencys-wealth-11639996204"&gt;limited few&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GI1wL9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi, I'm sure that whoever runs this account has no idea who I am, but I founded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mozilla&lt;/a&gt; and I'm here to say fuck you and fuck this. Everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters.&lt;/p&gt;— j͕̠̦̪͕̓͛̊̾̄ͅw̧̧̳̪̘͊̋͗̾͢͠z̢̘̞͈̺̞̩̓̽̐̋͗̆̋̚͟͜ (@jwz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCSMBF"&gt;Peter Linss, who made the Gecko engine that underpins Firefox, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/plinss/status/1478135256683143168"&gt;tweeted his disapproval&lt;/a&gt; to Mozilla as well. “What. The. Actual. Fuck,” he said. “You were meant to be better than this.” And it’s not just them — many quote-tweets of Mozilla’s December 31st post &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1476951030638260225/retweets/with_comments"&gt;are brutal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcniu9"&gt;On Thursday, Mozilla addressed the situation in a Twitter thread. “Last week, we tweeted a reminder that Mozilla accepts cryptocurrency donations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143340159422468"&gt;Mozilla said&lt;/a&gt;. “This led to an important discussion about cryptocurrency’s environmental impact.” Mozilla says it will be “reviewing if and how our current policy on crypto donations fits with our climate goals,” and while that review is taking place, it will be pausing crypto donations. It also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143343531692032"&gt;promised that&lt;/a&gt; the review will be “a transparent process” and that it will “share regular updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BloCBH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the spirit of open-source, this will be a transparent process and we'll share regular updates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We look forward to having this conversation and appreciate our community for bringing this to our attention. 4/4&lt;/p&gt;— Mozilla (@mozilla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143343531692032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93k8u9"&gt;However, Mozilla isn’t completely distancing itself from decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1479143341262577676"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; “decentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTrSIC"&gt;Mozilla is just the latest company to take heat for its involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Tesla was lambasted for its decision to accept bitcoin as payment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it reversed the policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;soon after&lt;/a&gt;. And gaming companies have recently been heavily criticized for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;NFT efforts&lt;/a&gt;, with the developer of the upcoming game &lt;em&gt;STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; going so far as to entirely cancel its NFT plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;in response to outcry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter joins Instagram in copying TikTok’s reaction videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4rK_K-SyaMfwqIEa-axN5mGg3lk=/70x0:1690x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356568/FIcfXhPXoAQ3oJp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter’s new “quote tweet with reaction” feature | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="04LXNr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing a feature called “quote tweet with reaction,” where you can embed a copy of a tweet into a photo or video instead of just replying to it with text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H1Ai2"&gt;Twitter says that the feature is currently being tested on iOS. If you have access to the feature, the retweet menu will have a “Quote Tweet with reaction” button. Tapping it will take you to a screen where you can take a photo or video to put the tweet on top of, or choose one from your camera roll. One of Twitter’s product leads did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samhaves/status/1479189730948378630"&gt;a reaction quote tweet to the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which lets us see how the reactions will show up to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTOqmD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. &lt;a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hCGehy4Y7CHtSKglOjeY52BlHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150607/ezgif_3_da208613da.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of creating a reaction to a tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AhYXy7"&gt;The feature is similar to TikTok’s video replies, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832529/instagram-reels-visual-replies-feature-tiktok-copy"&gt;Instagram recently copied for its Reels feature&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter itself has also been adding new ways to share tweets — in December 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166657/twitter-share-tweets-snapchat-snap-ios-feature-launch"&gt;added the ability to embed a tweet in a Snapchat message or story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlX0kJ"&gt;Some Twitter users, as well as staff members at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have expressed concern that these reaction quote tweets could be an easy vector for harassment. While it’s relatively easy for the platform to moderate regular quote tweets, it’s harder to programmatically scan the contents of a photo or video. It’s also not clear whether you’ll be able to opt out from reaction tweets like you can with Twitter’s photo-tagging feature or limit who’s able to react to your tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575998/twitter-tweet-change-who-can-reply-after-you-post"&gt;like you can with replies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm6xOz"&gt;Twitter didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s question about the ability to change who could react to your tweet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E3 2022 will be online-only again following COVID-19 surges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_AirGTwYPViOdOaYHnej3XMTK_I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356500/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="94TS8w"&gt;E3 — one of the largest video game trade shows of the year — will once again be an online-only event this summer, the ESA has announced, citing ongoing concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic. The news, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/06/e3-shifts-to-online-only-event-because-of-omicron-concerns/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marks the third year in a row that E3 will have skipped its in-person event due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYzmch"&gt;“Due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19 and its potential impact on the safety of exhibitors and attendees, E3 will not be held in person in 2022,” the ESA commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;. “We are nonetheless excited about the future of E3 and look forward to announcing more details soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xd4DQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;E3 will miss a third straight year in person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CReIOY"&gt;The ESA had originally planned to bring back E3 as an in-person conference in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;announcing in April 2021&lt;/a&gt; (when it officially moved that year’s conference to a digital event) that “the ESA looks forward to coming back together to celebrate E3 2022 in person.” But with the onset of the omicron variant and case numbers surging in the United States, the ESA appears to have decided that it’s not worth the risk of hosting a conference packed with thousands of journalists, game developers, and fans this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3WBAT"&gt;E3’s cancellation of an in-person event is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22869140/grammys-sundance-film-festival-postponed-virtual-omicron-coronavirus"&gt;latest in a series of major events&lt;/a&gt; that have been derailed by COVID’s latest surge: the Grammys awards show was just indefinitely postponed from its original January 31st date, while the Sundance Film Festival is also going online-only, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B3s26"&gt;The ESA isn’t the only one looking forward to summer gaming events; shortly after the news that E3 2022 would be a virtual event, gaming industry personality Geoff Keighley announced that his own “Summer Games Fest” event (which itself strove to fill the space left by E3’s cancellation in 2020) would also be returning in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRacing buys Monster Games, teases racing games for the ‘broader market’ like consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race at virtual Chicago Street Course" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YH4yCxtfYWCxutiK2cDyJCjb__M=/251x0:2963x1808/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356339/1321405595.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Davison, driver of the #15 Chevrolet races during the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race at virtual Chicago Street Course on June 02, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SXK9eV"&gt;One of the paid subscription services that experienced sudden growth during the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/features/iracing-nascar-made-in-america/"&gt;has been &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While real-life racing leagues were on hiatus, they used the detailed and realistic sim racing service as an esports broadcasting platform, and enough new people started playing to grow its base of racers on PC from 110,000 at the beginning of 2020 to over 200,000 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6saIAA"&gt;Now iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations &lt;a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-acquires-monster-games/"&gt;says it has acquired Monster Games, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (MGI). That Minnesota-based studio developed the first four games under the &lt;em&gt;NASCAR Heat&lt;/em&gt; brand and its most recent title, &lt;em&gt;SRX: The Game&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for play on PC and the PlayStation and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7Xt6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pro drivers are competing with gamers after F1 and NASCAR canceled races","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/22/21184192/sim-racing-coronavirus-f1-nascar-iracing-veloce-esports-max-verstappen-lando-norris"},{"title":"Fox will broadcast NASCAR’s substitute sim racing ‘season’ on television","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21194033/fox-nascar-iracing-pro-series-broadcast-dale-earnhardt-jr"},{"title":"NBC will broadcast IndyCar’s virtual replacement races on TV","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203305/nbc-indycar-iracing-series-broadcast-sim-online-esports"},{"title":"ESPN to air live NBA 2K League games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248075/espn-espn2-live-nba-2k-league-games-esports-matches"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HxYcJ5"&gt;A press release announcing the purchase is careful to note, “The iRacing development team will remain 100% focused on continuing to develop the core product, &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt;.” But Monster Games’ experience making console games is clearly a part of the plans going forward, as the release also says this deal will “further the company’s ability to bring the highest quality racing games to the broader market, including the console space.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQlaSB"&gt;Pumped up by its subscriber growth, iRacing also recently acquired Orontes Games, which had already developed a proprietary game engine to power the high-res graphics and advanced physics for its &lt;em&gt;Drag&lt;/em&gt; racing game that’s available via Steam Early Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JfWG1"&gt;Rich Garcia, CEO of Monster Games, has a history with iRacing CEO Dave Kaemmer from the early days of Kaemmer’s previous company, Papyrus, working on well-regarded PC racing games. The plan is for MGI to release an unannounced title in development later this year and then develop games using the resources of all three studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTdH3c"&gt;More information on what’s next is promised “in the coming year.” Still, a quote from Kaemmer gives a strong hint about what we should expect, “We are at a point as a company that we are comfortable building out these two new teams to explore the broader racing game market to ultimately funnel serious sim racers to our flagship product &lt;em&gt;iRacing&lt;/em&gt; on the PC. Rich and the Monster team will be an important part of that strategy as we use our code and experience to bring their games to another level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nRUY2"&gt;An &lt;em&gt;iRacing &lt;/em&gt;port for the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X seems unlikely, based on that statement, but bringing its ultra-realistic data to racing games built for play on consoles, as well as continued tech upgrades for the flagship title, appears to be a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eargo’s new hearing aids can automatically adjust to your environment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXrZ_p_sEwuPIWfII3unY6AqpWg=/0x243:7051x4944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355632/E6_full_charger_hd_off_Logos_1__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eargo 6 automatically adjust to a user’s environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eargo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GvYLxb"&gt;While a lot of health tech shown at CES is doomed to become vaporware, there’s reason to believe that 2022 is going to be a big year for hearables. Case in point: Eargo, a CES regular since 2015, is announcing the Eargo 6. The buds are the sixth iteration of the company’s smart hearing aids and feature nifty new tech that automatically adjusts sound levels on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvbH3O"&gt;Hearing aids work by converting sound picked up by a microphone into a digital signal that’s then amplified. They can also amplify certain sounds, like your voice, while also dampening background noise. Eargo’s are registered as an &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/1022593/mann.pdf"&gt;FDA Class II exempt device&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are a medium-risk device with specialized controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re1lG9"&gt;Given that this is Eargo’s sixth version of its hearing aids, some of the updates are iterative. For instance, the new Eargo 6 is better at masking background noise and “noise between pauses in speech.” It’s also got improved IPX7 water resistance. And Eargo added a “mask mode,” which allows the device to more accurately compensate for how masks dampen a speaker’s voice. But the big update this year is a new feature Eargo dubs Sound Adjust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5bSJl"&gt;Sound Adjust builds upon the Eargo 5’s Sound Match feature, which plays sounds in each ear at different volumes and pitches. That creates a personalized hearing profile that can be used to tune the device based on a specific environment, be it a loud restaurant or a meeting. The only issue with the Eargo 5 Sound Match feature was that the initial test to create a personalized hearing profile took 8–10 minutes, and if you ever wanted to update that profile, it requires putting them in the charger and waiting up to five minutes. For &lt;a href="https://help.eargo.com/en/articles/5159823-volume"&gt;temporary adjustments on the go&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to pull out your phone or tap your ear. Eargo says the new Sound Adjust feature builds on this tech via a proprietary algorithm to identify your environment without user input and then automatically modify the hearing aids’ settings. In a nutshell, it’s going from manual to auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuwrlL"&gt;While I wasn’t able to try the Eargo 6 in person, I did get to see a demo over Zoom. The Eargo buds are quite small, to the point where you can’t tell if someone’s actually wearing one. Since I couldn’t try one for myself, I’m not able to say how well the device works for someone like me — let alone someone with hearing loss. That said, the discreet design is notable. A major reason so many people don’t use hearing aids is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904535/"&gt;the social stigma attached to wearing one&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing"&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders&lt;/a&gt; believes roughly a third of people aged 65–74 suffer from hearing loss. That jumps to 50 percent for those over 75. However, only 30 percent of people over 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have used one. That number plummets to 16 percent for adults aged 20–69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HGV96F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders believes roughly a third of people aged 65–74 suffer from hearing loss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="39rCFA"&gt;Eargo CEO Christian Gormsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Eargo 6 is aimed at people with mild to moderate hearing loss, a group that has thus far been underserved due to the cumbersome process of getting hearing aids. There are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4599-steps-to-obtaining-hearing-aids"&gt;several steps involved&lt;/a&gt;, including getting a hearing test, clearance from your doctor, an appointment with an audiologist, and follow-ups. Another problem is hearing aids are expensive. According to &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/health/hearing-aid-cost.html"&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of one digital hearing aid ranges from $1,000 to $4,000, with the cheapest costing between $500 and $3,000. Even Eargo’s models are pricey at $2,950 for a pair (though the company offers a 45-day trial period and financing and says customers all receive lifetime support.) While Medicaid and some private insurance may cover some or all of the cost, most plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hearing-aids"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; — generally don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIIDVq"&gt;Other brands like &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/I/IQbuds2-Max.aspx"&gt;Nuheara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://us.oliveunion.com/"&gt;Olive Union&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hearinghealthmatters.org/blog/2021/signia-ax-insio-ces-2022/"&gt;Signia&lt;/a&gt; have also showcased their hearable tech at CES over the years. But there’s a good reason why 2022 might be a watershed year for hearing tech. Earlier in October, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-landmark-proposal-improve-access-hearing-aid-technology-millions-americans"&gt;proposed a rule&lt;/a&gt; that will allow people to buy hearing aids over-the-counter without needing a medical exam. The FDA also issued updated guidance for personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), electronic devices that act as amplifiers for all sounds. The agency is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/progress-toward-over-the-counter-hearing-aids"&gt;finalize that proposal in the next few months&lt;/a&gt;. This has huge implications for accessibility, as it’s expected to result in much more affordable products and reduce the number of steps needed to get a hearing aid in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtMzGN"&gt;Bigger tech companies have also been adding more hearing-related features to their gadgets. In May, Bose launched its FDA-cleared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430485/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aid-fda-cleared"&gt;SoundControl Hearing Aids&lt;/a&gt;, which don’t require seeing an audiologist and cost $849.95. The catch is that they’re only available in five states, though Bose does have plans to roll out the device nationally eventually. Apple also recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;a new Conversation Boost accessibility feature&lt;/a&gt; to its AirPods Pro. Samsung added &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/samsung-s-advanced-audio-chief-on-the-evolution-of-gala-1846279650"&gt;Voice Detect&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021 to the Galaxy Buds Pro and Buds 2. The feature works by activating Samsung’s Ambient Noise mode, allowing sounds from your environment to filter through whenever it identifies you speaking. The idea is so that you don’t have to take out your buds or switch modes when interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymr1lz"&gt;So far, the biggest hurdle in developing innovative health tech is navigating the FDA’s clearance process. Running clinical trials, though necessary, requires resources that smaller startups may not have access to. In theory, allowing over-the-counter hearing aids could not only grant greater access and autonomy for people who need them but also encourage further developments in hearing tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6CV3U"&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/over-the-counter-hearing-aids-pros-and-cons"&gt;audiologists have raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that over-the-counter hearing aids could cause harm by encouraging people to skip professional assessments. Hearing aids aren’t diagnostic and can’t fully replace doctors visits. Additionally, it’s not a given that factory presets on over-the-counter aids would be effective when everyone’s hearing is unique. The American Academy of Audiology’s &lt;a href="https://www.audiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/COMM21-Position_Statement-OTC-FINAL.pdf"&gt;official position&lt;/a&gt; on the matter states that while audiologists should offer support to people pursuing over-the-counter hearing aid tech, it believes consumers are “best served when they receive a comprehensive audiologic assessment prior to the use of any hearing aid.” For its part, Eargo says it employs over 40 licensed audiologists on staff to help users set up and customize their hearing aids — but that may not be the case for every company that decides to make over-the-counter hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close up of the Eargo 6 buds" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mpa0-BtcPGVGAr7Kycn_716i9N8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149512/E6_buds_corrected_on_white_L_R_Pads_1__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eargo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eargo 6 buds are quite tiny compared to traditional hearing aids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fPrOUH"&gt;This is a common quandary with many health-related gadgets, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;medical community is still coming to terms&lt;/a&gt; with how to handle people taking their health into their own hands. EyeQue Vision Check, a winner of the CES 2019 Innovation Award, is another example of an FDA-registered gadget that lets users skip an in-person vision test. I &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-avoid-the-eye-doctor-with-this-gadget-and-fa-1838853503"&gt;tested it&lt;/a&gt; — and while I did get a more accurate pair of glasses, my vision was still noticeably blurrier than the pair I got after finally visiting my doctor. Although some measurements were comparable, it wasn’t ideal for someone like me with severe astigmatism and myopia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwCrPh"&gt;Regardless of how it all shakes out, there’s also no guarantee that existing direct-to-consumer companies like Eargo will opt to take the over-the-counter route. When asked, Eargo spokesperson Grace Schwartzstein told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “anxiously awaiting the FDA announcement” and that it would “plan to evaluate accordingly.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM says Qualcomm’s computer chips will power its next-gen ‘hands-free’ driving mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEKmnZ3C9HAXLOeSFxze2Z9iWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355612/cadillac_2021_escalade_0433.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SYr6Go"&gt;General Motors completely redesigned the compute architecture that powers its next-generation “hands-free” driving system thanks to US semiconductor company Qualcomm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zk84X9"&gt;The automaker’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712566/gm-ultra-cruise-adas-hands-free-driving"&gt;Ultra Cruise system&lt;/a&gt;, which will make its debut in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226760/gm-cadillac-celestiq-electric-luxury-tease-ces-2021"&gt;2024 Cadillac Celestiq electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, will be the first advanced driver assist system (ADAS) to use Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Ride Platform. The size of “two laptops stacked together,” GM claims the new architecture will have the processing power equivalent to “several hundred” personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ABhtX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“two laptops stacked together”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i2wcPi"&gt;GM first announced Ultra Cruise during an investor event last year, describing it as a massive leap over the company’s Super Cruise system, which allows for hands-free driving on mapped, divided highways. In contrast, Ultra Cruise will cover “95 percent” of driving scenarios on 2 million miles of roads in the US, the company claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxY4JR"&gt;“We’re attempting to have this feature be sort of a door-to-door driverless operation,” said Jason Ditman, chief engineer at GM, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When the vehicle gets onto a capable road, Ultra Cruise will automatically engage and handle the majority of the work, hands-free. Stop signs, stoplights, turns, splits, merges, freeways, subdivision... all of those domains.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJwouVuC9ru4GPjyBYutvs355R0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149798/Ultra_Cruise_compute_image_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OoMsEa"&gt;That’s thanks to Qualcomm’s new high-powered processors, Ditman said. Last year, Qualcomm entered into an agreement with GM to provide computer chips for the automaker’s next generation of electric vehicles. When it comes out in 2023, the Cadillac Celestiq will be one of the first vehicles to feature the chipmaker’s new ADAS platform, which includes Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SA8540P system-on-a-chip and SA9000P artificial intelligence accelerator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXV0Qq"&gt;Those two SoCs will deliver “low-latency control functions on 16-core CPUs and high-performance AI compute of more than 300 Tera Operations Per Second for camera, radar, and lidar processing,” GM says. But more importantly, it saves the automaker a lot of room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2oiuzm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It lets us be real efficient with space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R86tOH"&gt;“It lets us be real efficient with space,” Ditman said. “It gives us the throughput that we need. And it let us take what was originally architected to be distributed modules throughout the car and move all that functionality into the one box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwhn7d"&gt;Consolidating modules for driver monitoring, mapping, and video processing into one box has also improved the system’s latency, Ditman said, because it allows GM to bypass the previous system routed through the vehicle’s CAN network. Ultra Cruise will use sensors like cameras, radars, and lidar to control the vehicle’s steering, acceleration, and braking. GM hasn’t announced all the details around the sensor suite, but Ditman noted that the system relies on a total of 20 different devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZd4G"&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, as well as monitor blind spots and even change lanes automatically. But the driver needs to stay vigilant and keep their eyes on the road; if they don’t, the vehicle’s infrared sensors will detect it, and the system will send several warnings to the driver before disengaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhOr7B"&gt;Ditman said GM learned a lot about driver behavior from monitoring their behavior and made appropriate modifications for Ultra Cruise based on those findings. Some studies have shown that drivers are slow to take back control from a Level 2 system, a troubling sign that could undermine the safety case for more advanced driver assistance. But Ditman said GM’s robust driver monitoring system serves as a “good training tool to get people to pay attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8uMDr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NPR’s losing top talent — everyone has a theory why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6Tsod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in Hot Pod Insider, The Verge’s subscription audio industry newsletter. For more stories like this, you can subscribe &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3kDyS"&gt;Something’s happening at NPR, and everyone has a theory as to what. But first, the impetus. On Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt; host Audie Cornish &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nprAudie/status/1478398877787111424"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; she’s leaving the program after nearly a decade as its host. Her departure, which she says on Twitter is her joining many others in the “great resignation,” marks three hosts of color to leave the network in recent months. (Noel King of &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/11/30/22809789/noel-king-vox-today-explained-co-host-editorial-director"&gt;left in November&lt;/a&gt; for Vox Media — disclosure that Vox also owns &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; — and Lulu Garcia-Navarro of &lt;em&gt;Weekend Edition &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/lulu-garcia-navarro-joins-times-opinion-as-podcast-host/"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in late September.) This &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; follows a thread from Sam Sanders, host of&lt;em&gt; It’s Been A Minute&lt;/em&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samsanders/status/1436025093872885760"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; all the hosts from marginalized communities who had left as of September, which includes Shereen Marisol Meraji of &lt;em&gt;Code Switch &lt;/em&gt;and Joshua Johnson of &lt;em&gt;1A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq0oVa"&gt;Many other NPR employees across various roles, including some of color, have left recently, too. These are just names that came up in the course of my reporting. There are surely more. Brakkton Booker, a reporter on the National Desk that’s now at &lt;em&gt;Politico,&lt;/em&gt; left in March; Sam Gringlas, a producer on &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered,&lt;/em&gt; left in December; Jacob Goldstein, co-host of &lt;em&gt;Planet Money,&lt;/em&gt; left in September for Pushkin; and, as of this week, two HR employees who were partners of the news and programming division left as well, according to a source, who asked to not be identified because of their ongoing work with the network. On Twitter, Ha-Hoa Hamano, principal product manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hahoais/status/1478806505411461120"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; she’s leaving (and discussed many other troubling details about her experience at the network). In 2020, David Greene, host of &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition,&lt;/em&gt; also quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll2urS"&gt;As my source says: “There’s been an email bidding farewell to somebody every week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrRAe7"&gt;An email also went out yesterday from CEO and president John Lansing, acknowledging both Cornish’s departure and the broader conversation happening around these moves. You can read the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1478803794590896142?s=20"&gt;relevant portion here&lt;/a&gt;, but he says an all-hands next week will “talk about development and advancement at NPR — for all staff, including our hosts.” He also calls “diversifying our audience that relies on our content, sourcing, and staffing” its “North Star.” And that “staffing relies on hiring but also development and retention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C8GmaA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MQzJh"&gt;So clearly, the turnover is real, and everyone is scrambling to chalk it up to a specific reason, including myself, the Twitter universe, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deuxmoi/comments/rwcus2/nerd_tea_what_on_earth_is_happening_over_at_npr/"&gt;even Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I spoke with four current and former employees, most of whom requested anonymity because of their continued work in the industry, to get a sense of the situation and what’s led up to all this turnover, and everyone’s thoughts coalesced around a few themes: more competitors who can offer both higher salaries and more creative freedom; NPR being a legacy media company hesitant to greatly alter its tried-and-true programs; and broader frustration with failures to carry out the network’s empowering mission statement, particularly for reporters and hosts of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jptViv"&gt;However, before we fully get into it, I do want to say I wasn’t able to speak to any of these hosts directly, and I’m sure, one day, when they’re wanting to share more, we’ll receive the real reasons behind their leaving. Much of this is informed theorizing and feelings, and I think we all know the decision to leave a job is typically highly personal, so let’s assume there’s a combination of things happening, including the X factor of pandemic burnout and restlessness. Now, for what I’m hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVDmhp"&gt;“There is still a mindset, I think, with certain levels of management that’s ‘why would you ever want to leave NPR once you get here because we are … the top gig when it comes to audio,’” says one producer. “But there are so many other places now that are willing to let you do different kinds of interesting things, and they’re willing to pay you more, and they’re willing to give you IP ownership of the things that you do, and those are just things that we have not moved quickly on, and we’re seeing it play out now in the form of highly talented people across the newsroom and across different parts of the building just say, ‘Well, I don’t have to be here to do the kinds of things that I want to do. I can go somewhere else to do that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoJB6K"&gt;Which is to say: the space is more competitive than ever, and that makes it a prime moment for creators. Lots of media companies are investing in audio, need qualified and talented hosts, and are willing to pay for that access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="R4oNfa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbYu9g"&gt;Another former producer notes, for context, that when they worked at NPR, listeners would write into the network mourning a host who had left 10 years before but that they still missed. This person, who was with the station for many years, says retention has always been a problem for producers and reporters but never got much attention because they weren’t the “higher profile people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziqCtk"&gt;“Why else would you care,” they ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uujTP"&gt;But as for why these hosts are leaving these programs right now, specifically &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt;, another producer says hosting these shows is a specific job that requires sitting in a chair for hours, which might not appeal to reporters who enjoy the on-the-ground aspect of gathering audio and interviewing. Another points out that these shows’ hosts or reporters might not have been able to try new formats or segments within the shows’ specific expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X98Sqb"&gt;“You have to stick to a certain broadcast clock, you have to continue to sound like what people think NPR should sound like, and there’s not a lot of room for experimentation in that kind of format,” they say. “So if you’re looking to do something different and you want to try something different, it’s hard to do that when your position is such that you’re part of a newsmagazine that’s going to look and sound the same every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMjBIf"&gt;One producer points out that when former &lt;em&gt;ATC&lt;/em&gt; producer Theo Balcomb wanted to produce a different kind of daily podcast, she took it to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example, resulting in &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PjjT8d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The standby NPR shows hesitate to experiment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fhQA"&gt;Maria Hinojosa, who says she was the first Latina hired at NPR in 1985, says these departures and the broader upset at the network likely have to do with not adhering to its mission statement to inform and represent the entire American public. She created and runs Futuro Media Group and also hosts &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt;, which NPR previously distributed, though as &lt;a href="https://www.latinousa.org/2020/06/30/latinousaprx/"&gt;of June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, it is distributed by PRX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfnlKJ"&gt;“For me, it was a difficult decision to leave NPR,” she says. “Because I was a child of NPR, you know, it was my first job.” She adds that NPR “wasn’t that into” &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt; leading up to the separation and that she fought to “keep the show alive.” She also points out that, over the years, she ran into uninformed questioning from the team. One host, she says, asked her if she was “pro-Latino” and could be “objective” because she hosted &lt;em&gt;Latino USA&lt;/em&gt;, for example, and she says she felt she had to “jump through certain hoops to prove to certain people” that a show or reporting style made sense and would be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIZ02"&gt;“The critique that I was making, that we were making, that we have been making for decades now, was not to take NPR down and not because we were curmudgeons, but because we understood what the future of the country looks like,” she says. “Therefore, the deep responsibility that NPR has is to be truly representative, and that takes a lot of self-critique, and you’ve got to go to therapy for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBZagp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A host asked Hinojosa if she could be ‘objective’ around Latino issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4NzLow"&gt;In a response to this story, NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara pointed to various hires, including Sandhya Dirks, Erika Aguilar, and Nick Charles, as well as the naming of new hosts, like Leila Fadel for &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;; Scott Tong for &lt;em&gt;Here &amp;amp; Now&lt;/em&gt;; and A Martínez for &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6Pu2Y"&gt;“Diversity in our staff, sourcing, and coverage is not only crucial to the accuracy and fairness of NPR’s content, but to the future of public media and our audience at large,” she says. “Ensuring that public media reflects the people of the United States is not a responsibility or initiative, but a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXPcpI"&gt;She also added that the company tracks voluntary attrition, and its attrition rate in 2021 was 9.3 percent, down slightly from 10.1 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61KbRh"&gt;I imagine we’ll be hearing more about this story in the days, weeks, and months to come, particularly in the expanded world of public media and member stations. For now, though, I’ll leave you with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hahoais/status/1478806505411461120?s=20"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/farai/status/1478811849365897227?s=20"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; I’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thesporkful/status/1478465187816554497?s=21"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WBJenna/status/1478457973001359360?s=20"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; days so you can get even more details and thoughts on what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For some reason Megalovania played during an audience with the Pope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkgyaY4k1HpL388gEZKkP2-Bh1I=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355372/sans.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FDjPBJ"&gt;Six days into 2022 and we’ve already had one of the weirdest collisions of gaming culture and the wider world. Yesterday, during Pope Francis’ &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_oKcdP7_WOU"&gt;weekly general audience&lt;/a&gt; in which he said a few prayers, made a few addresses, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/europe/pope-dogs-cats-kids-intl/index.html"&gt;casually shamed voluntarily childfree people&lt;/a&gt; for preferring the company of their pets to tiny, screaming humans &lt;em&gt;most of us cannot possibly afford&lt;/em&gt;, a troupe of jugglers / acrobats / general circus folk performed to a jazzy ska-esque rendition of “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wDgQdr8ZkTw"&gt;Megalovania&lt;/a&gt;” from Toby Fox’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eJivVN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year just started and we already have the insanity of Megalovania being performed in front of the Pope. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QBxGtl9v1c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QBxGtl9v1c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ultima | #вʟм (@UltimaShadowX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1478963456707641345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o7IaHa"&gt;Everything about this performance inspires in me a manic chuckle as I try to make sense of the scene unfolding in front of my eyes. The performance starts with an acrobat twirling a foam cylinder with their feet. Then, for some reason, the jugglers start, and &lt;em&gt;then &lt;/em&gt;someone wheels by on a unicycle making every element of this performance look like unorganized, mismatched chaos. Something that’s oddly fitting when you think about the chaotic terror of the Sans fight. In the Sans battle, just like in this performance, nonsensical shit is coming at you from all sides while a little man in a funny outfit smiles at you serenely as “Megalovania” plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lgUjMU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vr4IYjeplJA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5kNzc"&gt;As incredulous as it may sound, this is actually not the first time there’s been a Pope / &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt; crossover. In 2016, YouTube gamer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPatGT"&gt;MatPat&lt;/a&gt; famously &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/6/12105428/pope-undertale-youtuber"&gt;gave the Pope a Steam code for &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as he thought the game represented the same themes of forgiveness and compassion that the Pope alluded to in a speech he made earlier in the year. Maybe Big Catholic Boss Guy finally got around to playing it and liked the song so much he requested it for his next general audience. Of course, that would mean the Pope would have taken the “&lt;a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Genocide_Route"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;” option which, depending on your view of organized religion, may or may not match up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mqVGI"&gt;Wow, that got dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYsLcg"&gt;The history of atrocities committed in the name of religion aside, everything about this performance rips. I especially like the wide shot of the stage that includes the Pope in his funny outfit, the performers in their funny outfits, and members of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guard"&gt;Swiss Guard&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;em&gt;totally normal &lt;/em&gt;technicolor pantaloons and traditional halberd lending that extra dash of “is this real or am I tripping balls right now?” all while Fazzini’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resurrection_(Fazzini)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Resurrection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looms in the background looking ready to consume everyone whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUM1gF"&gt;It is the exact kind of surrealism I think Toby Fox would appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PF65V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJtZzM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMVIXFiXsFaA1I5NT9ildQ1A-vI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70355137/Image_Roborock_S7_MaxV_Ultra_Lifestyle_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roborock’s latest robot vacuum is getting closer to the Rosie the Robot of our dreams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roborock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The devices that will be vying for a spot in your home this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="a0FujX"&gt;The smart home kicked into high gear at CES 2022 this week, with new products for every corner of the home making their way onto the show floor (virtually in most cases). We’ve covered the most promising products in separate articles, but we’ve collated those here, and added in a few other noteworthy launches and announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIDoox"&gt;The dominant theme was interoperability. Yes, 2022 could be the year the smart home finally grows up, moving from a collection of shiny gadgets that provide mostly single-point solutions towards the whole home interoperability that has long been its promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtHH9S"&gt;Case in point, we barely saw any &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858402/home-robot-labrador-caddie-retriever-smart-self-driving-shelf"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858262/moen-smart-faucet-motion-control-smart-water-network-ces2022"&gt;Moen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858256/masonite-smart-door-ring-yales-ces-2022"&gt;Masonite&lt;/a&gt; debuted solutions that marry disparate products and services to create a smarter home rather than just a connected one. As Mitchell Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance said during the show, “Right now, we have a connected home. In five years, we will have truly smart homes due to the introduction of contextual awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAHUJd"&gt;A key part of that burgeoning awareness is Matter, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; that wants to make all connected devices in the smart home talk to each other, regardless of who made them. Matter was undoubtedly the wind beneath the wings of many companies’ announcements this week, and we’ll have a deeper dive on what’s new there and why it &lt;em&gt;matters &lt;/em&gt;(sorry!) later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRX07N"&gt;But for now, let’s get to the good part: all the new smart home gadgets and gizmos worth knowing about from CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrjEmR-uq_JYE-aK9I_Ir2o4RrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149507/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video doorbell is still the hottest security camera, with at least three announced this week — including this Belkin WeMo option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PTQKQJ"&gt;Lights, camera ... and more cameras&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="34fPNx"&gt;Smart light bulbs and connected security cameras have long been the darlings of the smart home. That shows no sign of slowing down, with a slew of new products in both categories being announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lefQLIhHlbNM2XIqhSygIg_qtAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149541/Eve_Outdoor_Cam_Solutionshot_wo_Badges.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3UJ4P5"&gt;Eve’s latest security camera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;the $250 Eve Outdoor Cam&lt;/a&gt; launches April 5th, 2022. A floodlight camera designed for Apple HomeKit Secure Video, it features 1080p video, a 157-degree field of view, infrared night vision, and infrared motion detection covering 100 degrees at distances of up to 30 feet. Read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The lighting line starts at just $12 and arrives in March. Cync’s outdoor camera arrives in February starting at $100, and the thermostat ($120) with room sensors ($30 each) is available in January. It seems the lighting company, now owned by high-end custom smart home company Savant, is angling to be a bigger player in the space. Get the details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860472/cync-gelighting-smart-bulbs-thermostat-camera-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGr9Nx"&gt;TP-Link has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865369/tp-link-tapo-smart-home-products-homekit"&gt;new line of smart home products under its Tapo brand&lt;/a&gt;. These include HomeKit-enabled smart lights, plugs, and a smart switch. The products arrive this year, starting with the Mini Plug. The company also announced four new Tapo cloud-connected security cameras — some of which can record to a microSD card. See the full lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865369/tp-link-tapo-smart-home-products-homekit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $80 Abode doorbell has impressive specs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmfcIl"&gt;Smart home security company Abode announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fwireless-video-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22870187%2Fsmart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new wireless video doorbell&lt;/a&gt; and its first foray into smart home lighting with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fabode-color-bulb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22870187%2Fsmart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode Color Bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of these require a connection to an Abode smart home security hub, but they are compatible with it. The $80 Abode Wireless Video Doorbell is battery-powered and features 2K HD video with a 160-degree field of view. It has full-color night vision and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi or can be ethernet-connected. Battery life is six months, and the camera includes person detection. Recorded video requires an Abode subscription plan starting at $6 a month, which also opens up automations with Abode’s Cue automation engine. It comes with an Abode Chime, which is a Wi-Fi extender and doorbell chime in one, and launches in April. The Abode bulbs are full-color, Wi-Fi smart bulbs emitting 800 lumens with a 90 plus CRI and cost $30 for a two-pack. They’re available now from Abode.com. Abode’s products work with Alexa, Google, and IFTTT, and the doorbell can stream live video to a compatible smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRhDA20-jzIUPwTJbFOCLE7SdfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149569/eufy_Video_Doorbell_Dual___product_image.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Eufy Dual. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="219aB4"&gt;Eufy showed off a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;new dual-camera video doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, an intriguing solution for your porch pirate problems. The $260 buzzer arriving next month comes with a hub for local storage, and its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the main 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. Another new Eufy product is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Eufy Garage-Control Cam&lt;/a&gt; that can keep an eye on your garage in 1080p or 2K video and also control the door. Pricing starts at $99, and two versions will launch in March of this year. More details are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcAFPy"&gt;Belkin WeMo launched its first smart doorbell camera. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;$250 Wemo Smart Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; is a wired doorbell with a 178-degree vertical field of view and 4MP high-resolution camera designed exclusively for Apple’s HomeKit and is available now.

It also has new Wi-Fi Video-Sync TV light strips ($120), Wi-Fi Outdoor String Lights ($80 to $90), a Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-connected portable LED Lamp ($60 to $70), Wi-Fi LED Essential Oil Diffuser Light, a Zigbee window and door sensor, and a motion sensor for controlling all those smart lights.

&lt;h1 id="rMexIs"&gt;Smart home security steps it up &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="LypQgU"&gt;Another huge space for the smart home in 2021 that is getting even more crowded in 2022 is home security. And we’ve got some new, innovative security systems and safety gadgets to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWQ5Cv"&gt;Arlo’s newest product isn’t a camera. The smart home camera company revealed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"&gt;Arlo Security System&lt;/a&gt;, a DIY smart home security system featuring all-in-one multi-sensors with eight different functions, plus NFC integrated into the hub so users can tap their phone to disarm the system. Arlo says the system will be available to buy in the first half of 2022.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart security gets cute with this teeny, portable solution from Bosch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2WwKP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spexor-bosch.com/en/"&gt;Bosch’s Spexor&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile security “assistant” that can monitor for break-ins as well as measure air quality and temperature. A tiny, 4.7-inch high device, the Spexor uses air pressure, noise, and motion sensors to detect an intrusion and alert you to changes in air quality. It can run on battery power for up to three weeks and can work with an eSIM card as well as over Wi-Fi. This could be a handy device for camping or RVs, or for monitoring a hotel room or other place you’re staying temporarily. We also like that it doubles as an air quality monitor, giving it usefulness beyond just when something nefarious is going on. It’s currently available in Germany for €250, but there’s no information on when it might come to other markets. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Glass Break Sensor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLCz4W"&gt;Ring has finally caved and introduced a glass break sensor to its Ring Alarm smart home security system. While Ring Alarm owners have been able to call on the power of Alexa using an Echo speaker for this key security feature (Alexa Guard, when enabled, can listen for the sound of glass breaking), a dedicated device for this purpose is something Ring Alarm users have been clamoring for. A glass break sensor can help detect when someone breaks a window to get into your home, and the &lt;a href="https://ring.com/products/glass-break-sensor"&gt;Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor&lt;/a&gt; detects the sound of glass breaking up to 25 feet away. It costs $40, is available for preorder now, and starts shipping February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXrzDW"&gt;There is now another smart smoke alarm option, although it’s not all we hoped it would be. &lt;a href="https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/kidde-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarm-with-smart-features"&gt;Kidde’s new Smoke + CO Alarm with smart features&lt;/a&gt; costs $90 and is available now at Home Depot and &lt;a href="https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/kidde-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarm-with-smart-features"&gt;Kidde.com/smart&lt;/a&gt;. It features Wi-Fi connectivity to alert you via the Kidde app to any alarms in your home. You can also use the app to hush nuisance alarms and connect them to Amazon Alexa and Google voice assistants from the app. But there appear to be no other smart home integrations beyond using voice to check on alarm status and connection. And the promised HomeKit integration with Kidde’s RemoteLync system &lt;a href="https://www.thedigitalmediazone.com/2018/01/12/kidde-shows-homekit-compatible-remotelync-bridge/"&gt;that was teased at CES 2018&lt;/a&gt; seems to have fallen by the wayside. The new alarms, which are hardwired with a backup battery, can make existing Kidde alarms smart when you add one to an existing interconnected system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="f7Ikr5"&gt;Can you follow this Thread?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tY2AnN"&gt;Thread, a key protocol in the upcoming smart home standard Matter, got a lot of airtime this week as companies announced new products that use this low-powered, IP-based smart home mesh networking protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BB2EmD"&gt;Eve’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;Thread-enabled smart blinds&lt;/a&gt; went on sale this week for the first time. Announced earlier this year, the MotionBlinds start at just under $400 per shade and can be ordered through any Coulisse reseller, including &lt;a href="https://www.selectblinds.com/eve-motionblinds"&gt;selectblinds.com&lt;/a&gt;. The MotionBlinds will be available first as smart roller shades and are compatible with HomeKit and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F4pI7"&gt;Smart lock makers Schlage have announced the first lock with a Thread radio. Its Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is also the first Apple Home Key lock, and its Thread radio specifically supports HomeKit over Thread. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y0WNC"&gt;Wemo revealed its working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt;, Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer to be released later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines can now be a Thread border router for your HomeKit home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YPuwbW"&gt;Nanoleaf, the makers of seriously fun smart lighting products, announced its Nanoleaf Shapes, Elements, and Lines products will become Thread border routers for all Thread over HomeKit devices. Border routers act as a bridge between Wi-Fi and Thread products. But unlike the traditional white plastic boxes we’re accustomed to, border routers can be cool, useful products like these light panels. The update will come in the first quarter of 2022. Previously, these Nanoleaf light panels were able to act as border routers for Nanoleaf’s own Thread devices, but now that functionality extends to any HomeKit-enabled Thread-based products, such as the Eve Room or Eve Energy smart plug. While you will still need a HomePod Mini or other Apple Home hub for HomeKit control, now you can create a Thread network independently of those hubs, should you wish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hp7541"&gt;Aqara will release a new version of its motion sensor and door and window sensor with Thread technology built-in in the second half of 2022. Aqara’s products work with HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home through its Zigbee-based hubs. The company also confirmed it will bring Matter support to its existing Zigbee-based products by pushing an over-the-air update to its M2 and the M1S hubs. This will allow all compatible connected sensors to connect to other Matter-compatible third-party devices when the standard launches later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qk8-cdmeqdbEyQiGP83K_526QM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149474/roborock_s7_maxv_ultra_100915271_large.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="roWjQn"&gt;Keep it clean, please&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="PPeFvL"&gt;Robot vacuums that can also mop have largely been disappointing. They basically drag a wet rag around your floor, which you then have to clean, dry, and reattach, and then refill the tiny tank. But Roborock and Ecovacs announced two new competing products at CES this week that want to change that. These fully automated cleaning and mopping and vacuuming bots are inching us closer to that Rosie the Robot dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEPEug"&gt;The new Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra features sonic mopping (i.e., scrubbing rather than just dragging) plus an automatic mop-lift that raises the pad when going over carpet while still vacuuming. Its compatible Empty Wash Fill dock can also wash the mopping cloth and refill the tank with water, as well as emptying the vacuum and cleaning the dock — taking away almost all the manual maintenance required to keep a mopping robot operating. The S7 MaxV Ultra costs $1,400 and is coming in the second quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecovacs’ Deebot X1 OMNI can also self-empty and self-clean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hpSEHW"&gt;Ecovacs has also designed a docking station for its new Deebot X1 OMNI bot vac that can clean the mopping pad and refill the water tank whilst also emptying the bin. The Deebot features carpet avoidance, so it will go around any rugs and miss the carpet. But unlike the Roborock, you’ll have to manually remove the mop to vacuum the rug. But the XI OMNI does have its own onboard voice assistant, so you can tell it what to do without having to use a third-party smart speaker. Called YIKO, it’s a natural language processing technology that takes direct speech commands, so you can tell it to start, stop, and where to clean without getting out a phone or talking to a smart speaker. The Deebot X1 OMNI will be available in March for $1,549 at ecovacs.com and Amazon and at Best Buy in April.&lt;/p&gt;

A collaboration between the door manufacturer, Ring, and Yale, the M-Pwr Smart Door is the first residential exterior door to integrate power, lights, sensors, a video doorbell, and a smart lock into the door system. It’s only available in new home construction initially, and no pricing or release date is available for retrofit applications.

&lt;p id="RpaH9T"&gt;Schlage announced the first Home Key compatible smart lock for North America. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus&lt;/a&gt; Smart WiFi Deadbolt is an updated version of the popular Schlage Encode WiFi smart lock, adding an NFC chip for the Home Key function, as well as a Thread radio to support HomeKit over Thread. It will be available in spring 2022 for $300, and we have more details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage’s new lock can use an Apple Watch as a key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oVL7Lo"&gt;Kwikset released its newest Z-Wave lock that is the first to feature the Z-Wave 700 series chip. The Home Connect 620 uses a traditional key and a keypad and can connect to a smart home using Z-Wave. The new 700 series chip adds Z-Wave SmartStart (QR code scanning) and increased wireless security features. It also helps the device to use less power (more than 50 percent less). But the most exciting part about Z-Wave 7000 is the expanded range, 250 percent greater than the Z-Wave Plus 500-Series, according to the company — making this entry-level lock a good option for a garage or shed door. The Home Connect 620 will cost $149 and comes in a traditional and contemporary style.&lt;/p&gt;

PerfectFill consists of a drain kit and digital valve that work together to draw the bath to your preferred temperature and depth. Pricing starts at $2,700. Kohler also debuted a kitchen faucet that’s suspended from the ceiling and controlled by a waterproof, battery-operated Bluetooth puck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiBzW2"&gt;Moen’s latest smart faucet — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858262/moen-smart-faucet-motion-control-smart-water-network-ces2022"&gt;the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion Control&lt;/a&gt; — adds completely handle-free operation to its connected tap. Now, alongside voice control with Alexa or Google and waving to turn it on and off, you can use gestures to control temperature as well. The company also announced integrations between its smart faucet and other smart water products and its new Smart Water Network, a residential smart water ecosystem centered around Moen’s Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff. We’ve got more information in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858262/moen-smart-faucet-motion-control-smart-water-network-ces2022"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It joins Samsung’s Bespoke line —  a selection of modular, configurable appliances with a clean, modern look and customizable colors and finishes. The fridge with a tablet built in also has an updated, bezel-less design for its signature 21.5-inch touchscreen, support for Samsung TV Plus, and upgraded internal camera technology that can scan food labels.

&lt;p id="GXFjh2"&gt;Whirlpool announced an over-the-air update to some of its smart, Wi-Fi-connected ovens that will deliver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22857723/whirlpool-smart-oven-air-fry-mode-convection-cooking-gadget"&gt;an air fry mode&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will arrive on its Smart Slide-in Gas and Electric Ranges and Smart Single, Double, and Combination Wall Ovens. The ovens are also getting the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.whirlpool.com/smart-appliances/works-with-yummly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22857723/whirlpool-smart-oven-air-fry-mode-convection-cooking-gadget&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22621764__t_w__r_theverge.com/smart-home_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ability to connect with Whirlpool’s Yummly smart thermometer&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you start preheating the oven from some of the app’s recipes.

&lt;p id="LzwgSj"&gt;For those who don’t want to default to Amazon, Apple, Samsung or Google to run their smart homes, there’s now another open source option for managing your smart home. The &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/"&gt;Homey Bridge Smart Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; finally arrives in the US this month. Already available in Europe, the Homey Bridge is a smart home hub embedded with Zigbee, Z-Wave Plus, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 433MHz, and Infrared. It’s controlled by the Homey App for creating automations with devices connected to the bridge, and the app can also be used independently of the bridge. Shipping now, Homey Bridge costs for $69. The app-only solution for Homey has a free version that controls up to five devices and a paid tier for $2.99 a month for unlimited devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxdyOq"&gt;Samsung announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Home Hub controller for its SmartThings platform&lt;/a&gt;. The tablet-like device is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their SmartThings smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. A portable, 8.4-inch touchscreen tablet with Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant built in, the Home Hub also has AI functions, two microphones and two speakers for hearing notifications and giving voice commands. Its global launch is slated for later this year. More details are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Aml6w"&gt;Fossil fuel companies and their close allies are some of the top spenders on Google ads that look similar to search results, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and climate think tank InfluenceMap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJziPc"&gt;The two groups searched for 78 terms related to climate change on Google and then looked at the ads that popped up on the platform. Of more than 1,600 ads, over one in five were from companies “with significant interests in fossil fuels.” The top twenty advertisers included fossil fuel giants ExxonMobil, Shell, and Aramco. Consulting firm &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html"&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt; and investment firm &lt;a href="https://capitalmonitor.ai/institution/banks/explaining-goldman-sachs-sustainability-drive/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20facilitated%20%2418.94bn,it%20calls%20a%20decarbonisation%20service."&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, which have been criticized for working with fossil fuel companies, were also big spenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yi55Ie"&gt;“Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves,” InfluenceMap senior data analyst Jake Carbone told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LN51A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NWH11"&gt;The ads they analyzed mimic the look of typical search results and often appear at the top of the page. One &lt;a href="https://varn.co.uk/01/31/58-1-of-people-dont-which-links-on-google-are-ads-is-google-making-ads-less-clear/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2020 found that 58 percent of people don’t know the difference between those ads and regular links. As a result, Google searches might funnel unsuspecting users to content from groups with a vested interest in promoting the fossil fuels responsible for the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGv3fz"&gt;Many of the ads portray fossil fuel companies as going green, like an ad from Shell that says it’s “a willing and able player in the energy transition.” Another ad from BP says it is “Building and advocating for more renewable capacity &amp;amp; infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdBP5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and InfluenceMap study found 153 ads from Shell that showed up on 86 percent of searches for the term “net zero.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; searched for “net zero” on Google this morning and found an ad at the top of the page from oil and gas company BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4Qiz"&gt;“Net zero” has become a popular goal for countries and companies to reach to essentially reduce and cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by burning fossil fuels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134843/bp-greenhouse-gas-emissions-net-zero-climate-change"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-shell-says-new-brazil-sized-forest-would-be-needed-to-meet-1-5c-climate-goal"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; have set goals to reach net zero by 2050, claims that experts have called &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing"&gt;greenwashing&lt;/a&gt; because both companies still plan to continue producing fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imPfFh"&gt;The entire world needs to reach net zero emissions by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate change, according to a vast &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;body of research&lt;/a&gt;. To hit that goal, there should be no new oil, gas, or coal development, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; developed by the International Energy Agency last year. Selling themselves as part of the solution for climate change is one way fossil fuel companies are trying to stay in business despite consensus among scientists that coal, oil, and gas need to be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8H5eR"&gt;This isn’t the first time Google has come under fire for helping to amplify fossil fuel interests. It came to light last month that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838243/google-ads-climate-change-denial"&gt;continued to run ads on content promoting climate denial&lt;/a&gt;, even after it made a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; to ban the practice. In response to those findings by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, Google said it took down the ads from most of the URLs for violating its policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVfpk6"&gt;In response to an email from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google reiterated its policy banning ads that feature climate denial, and pointed to its efforts to feature ‘information panels’ about climate change on its Search platform. It also insisted that it adequately labels its ads. It did not indicate that it was planning on taking any action based on the new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
