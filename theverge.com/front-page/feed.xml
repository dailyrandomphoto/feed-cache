    <title>Alienware’s X15 is its thinnest and coolest gaming laptop yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware X15" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NROmUbilNm4Mj3T-mfJxDvLzN6E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69369972/alienwarex15lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X15 comes in lunar light, Alienware’s colorway that is white on the outside and black on the inside of the clamshell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JcFeky"&gt;Alienware is keen on giving Razer a run for its money when it comes to making a super-thin gaming laptop. Two of the configurations of Alienware’s new X15 flagship model are actually 15.9mm thick, almost the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Razer’s just-refreshed 15.8mm-thick Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;. That’s impressively thin, especially considering that Alienware doesn’t usually try to compete in this realm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sAAX3"&gt;What’s also noteworthy is that, despite its thin build, the X15 looks like it will be a capable machine. Alienware is also announcing a bigger and thicker 17-inch X17 laptop that’s even more powerful. We’ll go into detail on both below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00ThL6"&gt;Let’s start with the X15, which will cost $1,999 for the base model, available starting today. Packed into that entry model is Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7-11800H processor (eight cores and a boost clock speed of up to 4.6GHz), 16GB of RAM clocked at 3,200MHz (but not user-upgradeable due to size constraints), 256GB of fast NVMe storage (which is user-upgradeable, with two slots that support either M.2 2230 or 2280-sized SSDs), and Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics chip (90W maximum graphics power, and a base clock speed of 1,050MHz and boost clock of 1,402MHz). A 15.6-inch FHD display with a 165Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time, and up to 300 nits of brightness with 100-percent sRGB color gamut support comes standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iXoxDn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s flagship Tiger Lake-H mobile chips are here to take on Ryzen 5000 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"},{"title":"Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X15 and X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eC-fMyrVlI0BV1mxPxoD7huluQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546776/AW_x15_x17_front_angled_with_LED_touchpad.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X17 sits to the left of the X15 in this image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kvAZO0"&gt;Alienware hasn’t shared pricing for spec increases, but you can load the X15 with up to an Intel Core i9-11900H processor, a 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD (with a maximum 4TB of dual storage supported via RAID 0), and 32GB of RAM. To top it off, you can put in an RTX 3080 graphics card (the 8GB version, with 110W maximum graphics power, a base clock speed of 930MHz and a boost clock speed of 1,365MHz). The display can be upgraded to a 400-nit QHD G-Sync panel with a 240Hz refresh rate, 2ms response time, and 99-percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut. The X15 has a 87Wh battery and includes a 240W “small form factor” adapter. At its lowest weight, the X15 comes in at five pounds, but it goes up to 5.2 pounds depending on the specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhdSrO"&gt;All of the X15’s ports, aside from a headphone jack and power input, are located on its back. There’s a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, one Thunderbolt 4 port, a microSD card slot, and an HDMI 2.1 port that will allow the X15 to output a 4K signal at up to 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LD9xbz"&gt;If you’re all about getting a 17.3-inch screen, the X17 starts at $2,099 and has similar starting specs. It has a thicker chassis than the X15 at 20.9mm, and it’s heavier, starting at 6.65 pounds. But that extra heft apparently allows for more graphical and processing power, if you’re willing to pay for it. For example, its RTX 3060 card has a higher maximum graphics power of 130W. This pattern is seen for more pricey GPU upgrades, too, especially the RTX 3080 (16GB) that can sail with 165W of max graphics power at a boost clock speed of 1,710MHz. In the processor department, you can go up to an Intel Core i9-11900HK. Additionally, you can spec this one with up to 64GB of XMP RAM clocked at 3,466MHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaIIOL"&gt;As for the screen, there’s an upgrade option to get a 300-nit FHD G-Sync panel with a 360Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, but you can go all the way up to a 500-nit 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 4ms response time. Like the X15, the X17 has an 87Wh battery, but whether you get a 240W or 330W power supply will depend on the configuration that you buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXJVey"&gt;The X17 has all of the same ports as the X15, along with one extra USB-A port, a Mini DisplayPort jack, and a 2.5G ethernet port (the X15 includes a USB-C to ethernet adapter). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X15 and X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V10aSiRQKcm-8tCGpVJGmae7hzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546780/alienwarethickness.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X15 on top is almost as thin as Razer’s new Blade 15 Advanced. The X17 beneath it is considerably thicker and heavier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e1Guaf"&gt;Generally speaking, thinner laptops struggle with heat management. But Alienware’s Quad Fan claims to move a lot of air, and in X15 and X17 models that have the RTX 3070 or 3080 chips, it touts a new “Element 31 thermal interface material” that apparently provides a boost in the thermal resistance of its internals compared to previous Alienware laptops. We’ll have to see how this fares when we try out a review unit. I’m curious how loud they might get in order to stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmp53J"&gt;If you’re an Alienware enthusiast, be aware that the company’s mainstay graphics amplifier port is missing. We asked Alienware about this, and it provided this statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8ppYER"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today’s latest flagship desktop graphics cards achieve graphical power beyond what the Alienware Graphics Amplifiers (as well as other external graphics amplifiers) can successfully port back through PCI (and Thunderbolt) connections. For Alienware customers who are already purchasing high-end graphics configurations, the performance improvements from our Alienware Graphics Amplifier would be limited. While improvements would be noticeable, in many cases it wouldn’t be enough to justify purchasing an external amplifier and flagship graphics card. So instead, we are using that additional space to offer extra ports and thermal headroom which provides a better experience for all gamers purchasing this product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItZ4Gx8px2CG0RfLNYuBsdgH5sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546784/alienwarex15ports.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the rear of the X15 looks like. The X17 has one extra USB-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and an ethernet jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LpC1uF"&gt;Wrapping up this boatload of specs, the X15 and X17 each have a 720p Windows Hello webcam, and configurations with the RTX 3080 have an illuminated trackpad that can be customized within Alienware’s pre-installed software. These laptops come standard with Alienware’s X-Series keyboard that has per-key lighting, n-key rollover, anti-ghosting, and 1.5mm of key travel. In the X17, you have the option to upgrade to Alienware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;Cherry MX ultra low-profile mechanical switches&lt;/a&gt;, which have a longer 1.8mm key travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idG2dY"&gt;Lastly, both laptops are available in the “Lunar Light” colorway, which is white on the outside shell and black on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD announces the Radeon RX 6000M series with RDNA 2 architecture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AMD Radeon X 6800M on a metal surface seen from above." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZac4HOY5VIz3TYWjRHY3Dd_SRs=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69369667/AMD_Radeon_RX_6800M_and_Radeon_RX_6700M_GPU_3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Radeon RX 6800M.&lt;/em&gt; | AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XfZhZi"&gt;AMD has announced its long-awaited Radeon RX 6000M series of mobile GPUs, featuring its RDNA 2 architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K260QY"&gt;Today’s release consists of three chips: the RX 6800M (configurable at 145W and above), the RX 6700M (up to 135W), and the RX 6600M (up to 100W). AMD says the flagship 6800M delivers the fastest AMD graphics for laptops yet; it claims the 6800M will run modern AAA games at frame rates that are comparable to or better than those of Nvidia’s mobile RTX 3080. It’s also purported to outperform Nvidia’s chip while gaming on battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvbNjG"&gt;AMD says the RX 6700M will deliver up to 100fps “in popular games” at 1440p resolution. The 6600M is better for “epic 1080p gaming.” Keep an eye out for independent reviews of these chips in the coming weeks for better idea of the performance you can expect from each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V032I2"&gt;The 6000M series will be available starting on June 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="efTHFv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10522317"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i3n8uu"&gt;AMD also announced AMD Advantage, a new “design framework initiative” meant to encourage OEMs to include certain features on their AMD-powered systems, and to indicate to consumers which Ryzen- and Radeon-powered laptops AMD thinks are the best. It appears to be a similar idea to Intel’s Evo program, but it’s just for gaming laptops, and the standards look much more stringent. It AMD Advantage laptops are expected to include the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mveRmy"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, Radeon 6000 graphics and Radeon software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hL8wDv"&gt;Support for AMD’s Smart Acess Memory and Smart Shift technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z2xscN"&gt;A display that reaches at least 300 nits of brightness, covers either 100 percent of the sRGB gamut or 72 percent of the NTSC gamut, has at least a 144Hz refresh rate and low latency, and supports AMD Freesync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AXFkxK"&gt;At least one NVME PCIE Express Gen 3 SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aqm3zo"&gt;The ability to maintain a surface temperature under 40 degrees Celsius on the WASD keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gjIhOQ"&gt;Over 10 hours of video playback on battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="h0NqlJ"&gt;It’s unclear how many laptops will actually meet all of these standards. Forty degrees Celsius is close to as hot as keyboards commonly get in the center. But there aren’t too many gaming rigs that reliably break 10 hours of video playback on battery, and plenty of the best gaming laptops out there max out below 300 nits of brightness. That said, all kinds of Intel Evo-certified laptops also don’t meet all the Evo requirements in my testing — units and methodologies can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpTnqP"&gt;The first AMD Advantage laptop to be announced is Asus’ new ROG Strix G15. This can be configured with up to a Ryzen 9 5900Hx, a Radeon RX 6800M, and a 15-inch WQHD 165Hz display with 3ms response time. The G15 will be available at Best Buy in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fall Guys beans are the perfect height to pat Among Us beans on the head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3iZATJgTY5m6OvcjrRbCbJ1qm0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69369108/E2vnSHoVIAE7_7A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a perfect match.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1399466545374371840" target="_blank"&gt;Among Us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LR2cy6"&gt;Turns out that the bean-like &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; characters would be the perfect height to pat the bean-like &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates on the head, should they ever exist in the same universe. The &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; Twitter accounts made the discovery on Monday. How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wyk1G"&gt;Well, it all started &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Bro_996/status/1399460605468155904"&gt;with this question&lt;/a&gt; from Chris on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8UHXqI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Is an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AmongUsGame&lt;/a&gt; crewmate half or a third the size of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FallGuysGame&lt;/a&gt; ? I'm doing a thing and wanna have proper height representation&lt;/p&gt;— Chris.Bro.996 (@Chris_Bro_996) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Bro_996/status/1399460605468155904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FbeS6z"&gt;It’s a good question. I can’t believe I’ve never asked it myself before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCWDEe"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1399464270107086854"&gt;then revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the crewmates in the game are three feet, six inches tall. Seems about right, though I honestly thought they were a little shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mWFSiz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;dunno how tall our Fall Guys beanfriends are, but Crewmates are 3'6"&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1399464270107086854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LBnNp2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1399464895134015488"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; quickly followed up with what people believe to be the canonical size of a Fall Guy: six feet, which is how tall one of the &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; bean creatures is in the game development software Unity. The &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; account also helpfully put a Fall Guy onto a chart next to a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DbYyVI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The actual size of a Fall Guy in Unity is 6ft, lots of people also believe that to be the canonical size &lt;a href="https://t.co/xDWHIRGq8w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xDWHIRGq8w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fall Guys   Season 4.5   (@FallGuysGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1399464895134015488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X6x2Kz"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; account then said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1399465230602850306"&gt;the obvious next thing&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9P3Zw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;need an among us bean added to the chart now&lt;/p&gt;— Fall Guys   Season 4.5   (@FallGuysGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1399465230602850306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce4TMA"&gt;And the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; account delivered, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1399466545374371840"&gt;to hilarious results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4CkL9k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i made one and OMG IT LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY THAT OUR BEANS ARE AT THE PERFECT HEAD PAT HEIGHT FOR YOUR BEANS         &lt;a href="https://t.co/8vVy0f5IJx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8vVy0f5IJx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1399466545374371840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yywcja"&gt;The chart shows that a &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; bean is exactly the right height to be able to pat an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmate on the head! Aww, they can be friends. (Though if I were a &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; bean, I’d be cautious about standing too close to an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5R9Rb"&gt;That’s not all, though. While I have you, I’d like to present my theory that &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; beans are a many-years evolved version of the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmates. Go with me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7zEat"&gt;Let’s start with the height differences that we’ve learned about today. They could indicate that the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; bean species grows to become as tall as the &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; bean species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="af7Yzc"&gt;I understand if that might not be enough evidence for you, so let’s compare the anatomy of the two bean-like species. The skeletal system of an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1398353487252103169"&gt;consists of a single bone&lt;/a&gt;, apparently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZXAoD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;

    <title>EA’s new multiplayer dodgeball game is now free to play until you reach level 25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogvQ2vUmTrzN72-lzV4SFUyiuis=/80x0:943x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69367998/koc_screenshot_16x9_1.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.575p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Knockout City&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tTvtnp"&gt;EA just released its chaotic and fun new multiplayer dodgeball game, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;, on May 21st, and for the launch, had put together a special promotion: the full game would be free to play until May 30th, after which you could pay $19.99 on the platform of your choice if you wanted to keep playing. (It’s also included with an EA Play or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ms0z9a"&gt;But on Sunday, EA and developer Velan Studios announced that even if you missed that window to try &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; without paying for it, you can still check it out without dropping a dime: the game is now free to try up until you level up your “Street Rank” (&lt;em&gt;Knockout City’s&lt;/em&gt; take on a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-like battle pass) to 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Saa7ly"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Block Party is over, but new players to Knockout City can still start brawlin' for free! &lt;br&gt;If your friends are just joining us, they'll be able to play for free and level up to Street Rank 25 before purchasing the game. That’s also enough game time to teach them to pass the ball. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aWjPjKS0ES"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aWjPjKS0ES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Knockout City (@knockoutcity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/knockoutcity/status/1398972535727955972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPv0z6"&gt;That level cap should give you few hours of playtime to try &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; for yourself and decide if you want to pay full price for it. And I recommend you give the game a whirl — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453234/knockout-city-dodgeball-ea-velan-studios"&gt;I was impressed&lt;/a&gt; with just how well it captures the feeling of actually playing dodgeball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OASw83"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Nintendo Switch, and it offers crossplay multiplayer, meaning you can play with your friends no matter what platform they’re on. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How bad is Google Photos’ compression anyway?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjfUx8UkkENNwUi08FxdJa38kfM=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69367842/newlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;My cat, Pretzel. The original photo is on the left, the compressed version is on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtCtkV"&gt;Google Photos has long offered one of the best deals in all of photo storage: it’ll back up your entire library for free, so long as it can compress the images a bit. But as of tomorrow, June 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;that deal goes away&lt;/a&gt;, and you’re now eating through Google storage (which you may have to pay for) whether your images are compressed or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7a4M8H"&gt;With the change looming, I’ve been wondering how bad Google’s compression actually is. Does the compression leave my photos in “High Quality,” as Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451607/google-photos-high-quality-storage-saver-tool-free-space-blurry-screenshots"&gt;has claimed for years&lt;/a&gt;? Or does the compression degrade my photos enough to make it worth using more storage by switching over to “Original Quality” backups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCjfty"&gt;I ran some quick tests this morning to find out. I took some photos and videos from my Pixel 5 (one of a few phones that will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;oco=1#storage"&gt;continue to get&lt;/a&gt; free compressed storage) and a photo from my Fuji X-T30 and uploaded them to two separate Google Photos accounts, one with compression turned on and one that maintained original quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYnVlK"&gt;The results were mixed. For photos, the compressed versions were often indistinguishable from their uncompressed counterparts. But once you’re losing resolution, the compression really starts to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AU06eR"&gt;Here’s what I found across a handful of tests. You can click the images to view them at a larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="hsh1pD"&gt;I can’t find a difference in this photo of my cat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2omYkz9Fte7JrdwCUnf6b-kCO3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550722/PXL_20210407_172630922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The original quality photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAJmHv2HmBaHKjagXmp5yerxeSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550723/PXL_20210407_172630922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The compressed photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u9rZSV"&gt;Here’s a photo I took recently of my cat, Pretzel. I zoomed in on his hair, his eyes, and the books in the background, and I can’t find a difference. The photo, taken on a Pixel 5, was originally 3.4MB but was compressed down to 1.5MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="G0XrCc"&gt;This ultrawide photo looks basically the same&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrbPoVscD5iuKyTtntd4X5IXWQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550724/PXL_20210524_175950510.MP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The original quality photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WSXMduO6_vChyMVXETqk_xt2b5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550725/compressedPXL_20210524_175950510.MP.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The compressed photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lSnKcP"&gt;I took this picture on Yale’s campus last weekend with the Pixel 5’s ultrawide camera. Both versions look great while in full screen on my computer. You could probably make an argument about whether there’s some more noises around the edges of the leaves in the compressed version, but I’m generally of the mindset that if you have to search for image issues, they don’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzPAq8"&gt;The space saving isn’t very substantial here: Google’s compression takes the file size from 7.3MB to 5.7MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="37j10y"&gt;The image size shrinks dramatically from my mirrorless camera&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gp-Ehhf-YyhM9ZmqoPObttgEX4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550726/DSCF0267.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The original quality photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jeQqTrHRg2nz8Bs56g6agoCF4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22550727/DSCF0267.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The compressed photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2yqKIV"&gt;Here’s a photo I took this morning of Pretzel on my Fuji X-T30. I zoomed in on his face, and couldn’t find a difference even when both were blown up as large as Google Photos could make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyjHPs"&gt;At first, it seemed like this was a situation where Google Photos’ compression won out: the file size shrank from 12MB to just 662KB, and the images look practically identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg9amn"&gt;But there’s one very notable difference. Google caps photo resolution at 16 megapixels, which shrank the photo significantly from the original 26 megapixel file my camera saved. Here’s a zoomed-in crop showing how the detail starts to disappear as blocky noise comes in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1yRQYn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10527132"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJYQRg"&gt;Now look, I don’t know that I need all 26 megapixels of this image at this point in time. But if I ever wanted to print this photo in a larger format, crop it down the road, or otherwise make changes to it, those extra pixels would be a huge advantage to have retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="K4THyC"&gt;Video compression is just bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id="OY9DYw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10527143"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Goz5gv"&gt;There’s nothing inherently wrong with 1080p video, but there is something wrong with the way Google processes it. And unfortunately, if you use Google’s compression, all your videos will be compressed at 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANKYZc"&gt;When that happens, everything becomes smudgy, details just vanish, and some colors even lose their pop. It’s a really significant downgrade in terms of quality. I’m not able to embed a Google Photos video here, so I included a screenshot comparison above. I think you can see most of the differences, although it’s much clearer how blurry text becomes at larger sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lyDsE"&gt;I originally recorded this video in 4K back on my Pixel 5 back in February. It looks nice enough on my not-4K computer screen. Street signs, faces, and the falling snow all look sharp. But the compressed version is kind of a mess — it looks like I recorded it with a layer of grease on my camera lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6qq7z"&gt;The loss (or savings) of data is a big one here: it falls from 55MB for this 10 second clip to just 6MB. No wonder it looks so much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="0yYteb"&gt;The compression makes a difference... sometimes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="MfcLEW"&gt;I still came away &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; impressed by the quality maintained after Google’s compression. For photos, the result can be nearly indistinguishable so long as the original file is under 16 megapixels. But for videos, there’s no question that uncompressed is the way to go. It’s too bad that Google doesn’t let you set different options for photos and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7LtdD"&gt;The real drawback is that compressing your photos doesn’t always save a ton of space. That extra space definitely adds up as you push thousands of new photos into the cloud each year. But if you’re going to have to pay anyway, it might be worth maintaining your photos — and especially your videos — at their full quality, especially if you’re uploading them in higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Climate change responsible for about a third of heat deaths, study says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PORTUGAL-WEATHER-HEAT-FEATURE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Xxcw_htjnYddENANRAwmYL2HnM=/0x0:3901x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69367253/1010354674.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People try to keep cool in Lisbon, Portugal during a heatwave in 2018. | Photo credit should read PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ei0ahA"&gt;Heat is a killer — and climate change is driving up its body count. On average, about 37 percent of heat deaths can be tied back to human-caused climate change, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01058-x"&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlflGE"&gt;The study looked at data from 732 places in 43 countries over a period of about three decades, from 1991-2018. They used information including heat deaths and temperature readings from those places to build computer models that calculated how many deaths could be attributed to climate change. The numbers varied depending on location, with a larger percentage of climate-change related deaths occuring in warmer countries than cooler ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56rsXL"&gt;Overall, about 166,000 people died of heat-related deaths between 1998 and 2017, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to climate change, more people are being exposed to heatwaves than ever before. “Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to heatwaves increased by around 125 million,” the WHO estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozPakz"&gt;There is one notable limitation to this new study — while hundreds of locations were included, many areas of Africa and Southeast Asia were not, due to a lack of data. Gathering that information in the future will be vitally important for new efforts to create a global accounting of heat-related deaths and illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35ehJh"&gt;“The countries where we do not have the necessary health data are often among the poorest and most susceptible to climate change, and, concerningly, are also the projected major hotspots of future population growth,” climate change researcher Dann Mitchell &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01049-y"&gt;wrote in an article accompanying the paper&lt;/a&gt;. “Obtaining these data will be key for science to provide the information needed to help these countries adapt.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AfCqv"&gt;“We are thinking about these problems of climate change as something that the next generation will face,” said Ana Maria Vicedo-Cabrera, the lead author of the paper in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/climate/heat-deaths-climate-change.html"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s something we are facing already. We are throwing stones at ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THKCNi"&gt;That’s in line with other research, which has found that climate change is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;already a disaster for human health&lt;/a&gt;. Older people, in particular, are particularly vulnerable, with heat-related deaths for this age group increasing by about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fglobal-health%2Fclimate-and-people%2Fheat-related-deaths-uk-elderly-double-20-years-climate-change%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F31%2F22461924%2Fclimate-change-heat-deaths-study" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;54 percent between 2000 and 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Some areas of the planet are getting hit worse than others, with extreme conditions happening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252174/heat-humidity-human-survival-climate-change-science-advances"&gt;even more frequently than predicted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zX0NuZ"&gt;Michelangelo’s marbles in the Medici Chapel were looking dingy, so a team of art restorers decided to smear some bacteria on the situation. The specialized microbes cleaned up centuries of grime, leaving the marble statues with a fresh new look, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/arts/bacteria-cleaning-michelangelo-medici-restoration.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDfxFh"&gt;The team selected specialized strains of bacteria to target different stains on the marble. Some types of bacteria can thrive in harsh environments and are adapted to eating things that can cause humans problems. These bacteria can break down things like pollutants into relatively harmless components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlL9P8"&gt;In this case, the team looked for bacterial strains that would eat away at the stains and other gunk, without harming the marble itself, and tested their top choices on an unobtrusive patch of marble behind an altar in the chapel. They found a few types that would work, and used gel to spread them across the statues. The different strains of bacteria ate away at residues, glue, and even the stains from an improperly disposed-of corpse that was dumped in one of the tombs in 1537. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAKmFj"&gt;The results of the project will be released in June, but you can get a tiny preview by looking through the images in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/arts/bacteria-cleaning-michelangelo-medici-restoration.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkWaW5"&gt;This is far from the first time that bacteria have been pressed into art-cleaning service. Italy, in particular, is known for putting microbes to work in conservation efforts. A sulfur-chomping bacteria was used to &lt;a href="https://aem.asm.org/content/73/17/5671.abstract"&gt;remove “black crusts”&lt;/a&gt; from parts of the Milan Cathedral, and performed way better than a comparable chemical treatment. In Pisa, a bacterial strain that eats pollutants helped clean up damaged frescos &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaamsen/2019/04/12/bacteria-cleaned-paintings-in-pisa-cathedral/?sh=5524c4731099"&gt;on a cathedral dome&lt;/a&gt; and at a &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/06/23/886276.htm"&gt;cemetery near the Leaning Tower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdDwpB"&gt;Other researchers are mapping out the bacteria and other tiny beings that &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-12-06/art-conservation-painting-microbes-bacteria-fungi/10584390"&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; live on paintings&lt;/a&gt;. They found that some microbes that made their home on the pigments might actually help keep &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-12-06/art-conservation-painting-microbes-bacteria-fungi/10584390"&gt;the artwork from deteriorating in the first place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says it can now fully charge a phone in eight minutes at 200W</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTEREz7crVo5fh-ISkhh1It2pKM=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69365040/xiaomi.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZKE5y"&gt;Xiaomi has shown off its latest fast charging tech demo, and consequently is claiming the new world records for both wired and wireless charging speeds. Using a modified Mi 11 Pro with a 4,000mAh battery, Xiaomi says it’s able to fully charge the phone in 8 minutes over a 200W wired “HyperCharge” system, or in 15 minutes with 120W wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeV6et"&gt;Charging speeds are a frequent battleground for Chinese smartphone companies, who often release demonstrations of breakthroughs that may or may not show up in final products. Two years ago, for example, Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/26/18282069/xiaomi-100w-super-charge-turbo-fast-charger"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a 100W system that could charge a 4,000mAh battery in 17 minutes, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; filled up in 23 minutes at 120W — though it did have a bigger 4,500mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Pfmq"&gt;Oppo is another leader in this field, with its VOOC technology forming the basis of OnePlus’ Dash and Warp fast charging systems. Last year it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325289/oppo-125w-fast-charging-65w-airvooc-wireless-charger"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; a 4,000mAh-in-20-minutes 125W system, though that was more than a year after Xiaomi’s supposedly faster 100W announcement, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;excellent current flagship Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; charges at “only” 65W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1oLy7"&gt;You can see Xiaomi’s latest effort here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ysK0k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Charge up to 100% in just 8 minutes using wired charging and 15 minutes wirelessly! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiaomiHyperCharge?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XiaomiHyperCharge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too good to be true? Check out the timer yourself! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InnovationForEveryone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#InnovationForEveryone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/muBTPkRchl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/muBTPkRchl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1399186017421127680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktDnpG"&gt;Progress is always welcome, and the thought of being able to fully charge a phone in eight minutes is certainly appealing. It’s worth noting, though, that these fast-charge systems always require proprietary chargers and cables, so they’ll mostly be used at home rather than in the emergency situations where they might be most useful. Ultimately, any given phone’s ability to make it through the day on its own juice will continue to be the more important factor for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1yJS7TmWuo1Cc0MXZtu2OI9JTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69364881/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WOe68"&gt;Intel made a splash earlier in May with the launch of its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series&lt;/a&gt; processors for more powerful laptops, but at Computex 2021, the company is also announcing a pair of new U-series chips — one of which marks the first 5.0GHz clock speed for the company’s U-series lineup of lower voltage chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0df8VH"&gt;Specifically, Intel is announcing the Core i7-1195G7 — its new top of the line chip in the U-series range — and the Core i5-1155G7, which takes the crown of Intel’s most powerful Core i5-level chip, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnkU6O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel announces its new 11th Gen Tiger Lake CPUs, available on laptops this fall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5pSqBq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Like the original 11th Gen U-series chips&lt;/a&gt;, the new chips operate in the 12W to 28W range. Both new chips are four core / eight thread configurations, and feature Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics (the Core i7-1195G7 comes with 96 EUs, while the Core i5-1155G7 has 80 EUs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmgxVm"&gt;The Core i7-1195G7 features a base clock speed of 2.9GHz, but cranks up to a 5.0GHz maximum single core speed using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. The Core i5-1155G7, on the other hand, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHz and a boosted speed of 4.5GHz. Getting to 5GHz out of the box is a fairly recent development for laptop CPUs, period: Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512501/intel-9th-gen-laptop-desktop-processors-5ghz-update-specs-speed-features"&gt;first laptop processor to cross the 5GHz mark&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykakbu"&gt;Along with the new processors, Intel has also announced its latest 5G modem solution for laptops — a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250061/intel-qualcomm-m-2-5g-modules-computer-pc-laptop"&gt;M.2 card&lt;/a&gt; that device makers will be able to incorporate into their designs, called the Intel 5G Solution 5000. (While Intel famously sold off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;smartphone 5G division to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has continued its efforts in other areas of the next-generation connectivity standard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2NmZP"&gt;The new modem is a collaboration between Intel, Mediatek (which is handling the modem firmware) and Fibocom (which is actually manufacturing the modules), and will offer sub-6GHz 5G support and integrated eSIM technology. Intel says that Acer, Asus, and HP will all be offering laptops combing Intel’s Tiger Lake chips and new 5G Solution 5000 cards later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram making changes to its algorithm after it was accused of censoring pro-Palestinian content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6dhYmT0EeXs7x29WAbtHENgZxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69364062/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2UzTvW"&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram has made changes to its algorithm after a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employees-bias-arabs-muslims-palestine"&gt;group of its employees reportedly complained&lt;/a&gt; that pro-Palestinian content was not viewable for users during the conflict in Gaza. Instagram typically surfaces original content in its stories before reposted content, but will now begin to give equal weighting to both, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xevjqx"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; and the&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2b394e5-d0c5-45e5-ba96-130865b02ce7."&gt; &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Instagram employee group had made numerous appeals about content that had been censored by Instagram’s automated moderation, such as posts about the al-Asqa mosque being mistakenly removed. The employees didn’t believe the censorship was deliberate, according to &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, but one said that “moderating at scale is biased against any marginalized groups.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHFE57"&gt;The change is not only in response to concerns over pro-Palestinian content, a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but the company realized the way the app functioned— bubbling up posts that it believes its users care about most— led people to believe it was suppressing certain points of view or topics. “We want to be really clear— this isn’t the case,” the spokesperson said. “This applied to any post that’s re-shared in stories, no matter what it’s about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2WedV"&gt;Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have been criticized over the past several weeks about how they have surfaced — or not surfaced—content around the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;Twitter restricted the account of a Palestinian writer&lt;/a&gt;, which it later said was done “in error.” And Instagram ended up apologizing after many accounts were &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/7/palestinians-criticise-social-media-censorship-over-sheikh-jarrah"&gt;unable to post Palestine-related content&lt;/a&gt; for several hours on May 6th, a move that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764509019607040?s=20"&gt;head of Instagram Adam Mosseri tweeted&lt;/a&gt; was due to a “technical bug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uoby0Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many people thought we were removing their content because of what they posted or what hashtag they used, but this bug wasn’t related to the content itself, but rather a widespread issue that has now been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764510378532864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qygd3H"&gt;Instagram says it has repeatedly heard from users who say they are more interested in original stories from close friends than they are in seeing people who reshare others’ photos and posts. That’s why it prioritized original stories, the spokesperson said. “But there’s been an increase— not just now but in the past as well — in how many people are resharing posts, and we’ve seen a bigger impact than expected on the reach of these posts,” the spokesperson said. “Stories that reshare feed posts aren’t getting the reach people expect them to, and that’s not a good experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYt87h"&gt;The spokesperson added that Instagram still believes users want to see more original stories, so is looking at how to focus stories on original content through new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
