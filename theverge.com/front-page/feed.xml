    <title>Google Calendar events now include a way to start group chats with attendees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydTMTc_bB1yPjHmnelquTdJnFQs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898950/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0ZlT5"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/easily-chat-with-meeting-participants.html"&gt;adding a new button to Google Calendar events&lt;/a&gt; on mobile and the web that will immediately open a chat with meeting attendees. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;launched its rebranded version of Hangouts Chat&lt;/a&gt; to customers earlier this year and has slowly added more features to the main Gmail landing page, including its Zoom-like Google Meet video chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkDPoU"&gt;The new Chat button appears next to the attendee list in a Calendar event. Previously, Google only offered the ability to email attendees about a meeting, but since the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;has closely integrated Chats and Gmail&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly to popularize Chats — this new addition makes sense. You can start a chat before, during, or after the meeting with attendees, and the feature will be toggled on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGSsSTpxuDbeNAvFCbYQJi2mS-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872378/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Chat button appears next to Google’s original email button on calendar events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TXK8AX"&gt;It’s worth noting, though, the automatic group chats “only [apply] to participants within your organization, external attendees are not included in the chat group,” Google writes in a post. So some participants might be spared (or miss, whichever you prefer) the extra messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ob5RPT"&gt;Google clearly wants you to use its messaging apps, despite what its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;confusing, ever-changing strategy&lt;/a&gt; might suggest. It might be annoying to be funneled towards Chat in yet another section of Google’s software suite, but for anyone who’s committed themselves to Google Workspace — or been forced to do so by their employer — here’s some added convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter enables tipping with Bitcoin, plans to let users authenticate NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4QGS1fAnQ_1BYai5ZJQSHH1bhTY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898748/Twitter_NFTs.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People will be able to mark their NFTs as legitimate on Twitter. | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VX8loq"&gt;Twitter is turning on the ability to ask for tips in Bitcoin through its app, making it the first major social network to encourage use of the cryptocurrency as a method of payment. The company also plans to let users connect their crypto wallets and authenticate the ownership of NFTs they tweet with a special badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoNL7L"&gt;Twitter has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;testing tipping&lt;/a&gt; for a few months now, but the company hasn’t made tips widely available until Thursday, when the feature is rolling out globally on iOS with Android to follow. Besides Bitcoin, Twitter will let users connect nine traditional payment providers, including Venmo and Cash App, to their profiles to accept tips. Twitter isn’t processing the payments itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioQh7w"&gt;The Bitcoin tips are facilitated by Strike, a Bitcoin wallet app that runs on the Lightning Network protocol. Lightning is designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions using Bitcoin. The company behind it has received funding from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a staunch Bitcoin advocate who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1403174877444587523"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was “only a matter of time” before Twitter supported payments via the protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sZVP5"&gt;Strike works in all US states except New York and Hawaii, and the country of El Salvador. In addition to their Strike usernames, Twitter users will also be able to add their Bitcoin addresses to their profile, which people can then copy and paste into their crypto wallet of choice to send tips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_BNpXY0DOqMruhMttJ7soMJgI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872472/Static_Sending_a_Bitcoin_tip_through_Strike.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How tipping with Bitcoin works on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJKhlA"&gt;Twitter’s app will notify someone when they receive a Bitcoin tip via Strike, letting them quickly reply to the tipper to say thanks or send an emoji reaction. Twitter will also generate invoices for creators to track the tips they receive. “Bitcoin represents one of the best solutions” for enabling people to transact in underbanked regions of the world, Esther Crawford, Twitter’s product lead for creator monetization, said Thursday during a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWVWnr"&gt;Bitcoin isn't the extent of Twitter’s crypto plans: the company said it is also planning to support authentication for NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, by letting people connect their crypto wallets. “NFT authentication will come in the form of a badge, shown on profile pictures, marking the owner’s NFT as authentic,” a company spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NATfFZ"&gt;NFTs have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;boomed in popularity&lt;/a&gt; as a way to buy and trade digital art on the Ethereum blockchain. A few months ago, the main Twitter account &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/"&gt;did a giveaway&lt;/a&gt; of NFTs that were minted on a marketplace called Rarible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-bike maker Cowboy finally moseys its way to the US from Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWBT9b5BLtHWvWdMd2M1GFPZYBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898718/ahawkins_210919_4769_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J1YpJ4"&gt;Belgium’s finest electric bike maker, Cowboy, is crossing the pond and expanding its operations to the US. Cowboy will only have one model available to American customers: its fourth-generation e-bike, aptly named the C4. The C4 comes in a high-step or step-through frame and is available for pre-order for the early bird price of $1,990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZKAWb"&gt;This is a very big deal for Cowboy, which has quickly grown into one of the more interesting and impressive e-bike companies in Europe since its launch in 2017. Cowboy has raised $42 million in venture capital funding and sold over 25,000 bikes across 11 different European markets. And now they’re saddling up and heading to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sBwgDG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve never done business in the US”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cBHbgB"&gt;“I’ve never done business in the US,” Cowboy co-founder and CEO Adrien Roose told me when we met up in Central Park in New York City earlier this week. “So it’s quite exciting for me personally.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4A27LSaq_flnF91a2Rn-yW_HF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870207/ahawkins_210919_4769_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfs2yd"&gt;Roose credits the rise of electric scooter- and bike-sharing services like Bird and Lime, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;Covid pandemic and the effect on travel habits&lt;/a&gt;, with the growing popularity of e-bikes and electric-powered mobility. He also cited the recent news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22590792/ebike-act-senate-brian-schatz-tax-credit-infrastructure"&gt;Congress may approve tax breaks for e-bike purchases&lt;/a&gt; as a factor in the growing level of excitement among e-bike companies for the US market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEcbHl"&gt;“We’ve seen strong signs that the US has reached some form of inflection points,” he said. “We really feel that the time is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPJBa3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has been tracking Cowboy’s progress for a number of years. We called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18656321/cowboy-e-bike-preview-price-date-removable-battery"&gt;Cowboy 2&lt;/a&gt; “the best looking pedal-assisted electric bike with a removable battery” and the &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy 3&lt;/a&gt; a more “mature” e-bike that was focused on “on safety rather than fun.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3C62bv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The C4 is a complete overhaul of the previous generations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZA91G"&gt;The C4 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;a complete overhaul of the previous generations&lt;/a&gt;, with 50 percent more torque and a new integrated “cockpit” with Quadlock mount that wirelessly charges your phone as you ride. I got a chance to ride the high-step C4 around Central Park this week and found the pedal-assist to be nearly instantaneous and incredibly intuitive. Hill climbing was a breeze, and the elegant, simplified design was extremely easy on the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSQcOl"&gt;The C4 reminded me a great deal of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3 by VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, Europe’s other maker of beautiful e-bikes. VanMoof has been selling e-bikes in the US for a number of years, and it’s likely that Cowboy will be competing with many of the same customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCGVwa"&gt;VanMoof is definitely larger and sells more e-bikes than Cowboy. But the Dutch company isn’t without its missteps. Last year VanMoof was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;hundreds of customer complaints&lt;/a&gt; about bikes that were scuffed or damaged upon delivery. Others complained about wobbly wheels, faulty brakes, or a wide range of cryptic error codes that flash on their disabled bike’s display. The Dutch company said it would direct some of the money it has raised in venture capital toward addressing these issues of delivery and quality control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LifBwP"&gt;By comparison, Roose was quick to tout Cowboy’s high customer satisfaction ratings and also the company’s unique approach to software. “In terms of comparing value proposition with Cowboy, there’s really only VanMoof,” he said. “And because we believe that we already have an edge in terms of software, we see ourselves a bit creating our own category with connected e-bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV63Kf"&gt;Cowboy’s customers can connect with one another on the company’s app for shared rides, where they can also compare stats related to health and fitness. It’s not something you see from a lot of e-bike companies, most of which are focused on battery power, motor performance, and other metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlu41o"&gt;Roose said the hope is that Cowboy can help change the conversation around e-bikes, with many cycling purists dismissing battery-powered biking as cheating. He noted that there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963426/ebike-exercise-fitness-heart-rate-study-science-electric-bike"&gt;several studies refuting this notion&lt;/a&gt; that e-bikes don’t provide any health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZGADC"&gt;“When you ride on an e-bike, you get to charge your vascular system that’s high enough to make an impact,” he said. “And people who have an e-bike, they use e-bikes more often and to go further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49gSEr"&gt;To start out, Cowboy’s mobile service and support team will be available in eight US cities, in which customers can make appointments through the app. Customers who live in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC, will have access to the company’s remote repair team. Preorders for the C4 can now be placed at Cowboy’s website, with the first bikes expecting to ship in January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will open its fiber networks to expand broadband access in rural Virginia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cvHb0dUM2LgCF32eddtfPRTiIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898728/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oj8PzK"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/network-moments-virginia/"&gt;announced a new project&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that will bring broadband service to thousands of households in Virginia this fall, in partnership with a local ISP and utility company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0Q8vi"&gt;The project began with fiber networks Facebook was already building to connect its data centers in Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina. With that fiber already laid, Facebook partnered with Appalachian Power and GigaBeam Networks to extend the networks to roughly 6,000 households in Grayson County, VA. The homes are projected to have high-speed broadband access by the end of this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KdIgqs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These are really complicated problems that we’re trying to solve”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDZvrf"&gt;“These are really complicated problems that we’re trying to solve. If they weren’t complicated, then we still wouldn’t have 19 million people that were unserved or underserved,” Michele Kohler, Facebook’s network investments team manager, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview Wednesday. “We’re trying to figure out how can we play in the equation, with these complex partnerships, to figure out how we can help people get connected faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4k9zSR"&gt;Kohler also said that Facebook is providing “engineering and technical resources” to the partnering companies. The proposed network would leverage a new law approved by the Virginia legislature last year that allows electric and communications companies to string fiber along existing poles and conduits. Still, the future of these networks is unclear as utility companies like &lt;a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/15/legal-challenge-slows-rural-broadband-plans-in-virginia/"&gt;Rappahannock Electric Cooperative&lt;/a&gt; have been sued by property owners for infringing on their property rights when they’ve sought to invoke the new provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lomoVl"&gt;Facebook’s announcement comes just a few months after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) said that the state would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580559/virginia-broadband-household-ralph-northam-mark-warner"&gt;be investing $700 million&lt;/a&gt; from the American Rescue Plan to reach universal connectivity in the state by 2024. President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;signed the coronavirus relief package&lt;/a&gt; last March, providing Virginia with more than &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/may/headline-895119-en.html"&gt;$4 billion in relief&lt;/a&gt; — the pool of money being used to support universal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PjgVc"&gt;“I’m a big believer that with this level of high speed and connectivity, people won’t be forced to move away to cities to find good quality jobs,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said in a statement regarding Facebook’s plans Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGuwvw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKLQ9G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Most dermatology algorithms don’t have transparent data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dermatology Symptomatology, Woman" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/90L8Tnq97pXAnwhZIEyk64JZ3rs=/1x0:5100x3399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898652/481684305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tyC2v"&gt;Most algorithms designed to help people identify skin problems don’t let experts see the datasets they were developed with and don’t share information on the skin tone or ethnicity of the patients in those datasets, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2784295"&gt;a new review&lt;/a&gt;. That could make it hard for people to evaluate the programs before using them and to understand if they might not work as well for certain groups of people, the authors argue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Cf0qs"&gt;These types of tools use pictures of skin conditions to teach a system to recognize those same conditions in new images. Someone could upload a picture of a rash or mole, and the tool would be able to tell what type of rash or mole it was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUxOOF"&gt;The paper, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed 70 studies that either developed a new&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;deep learning model or tested an existing algorithm on a new set of data. Taken together, the models were developed or tested using over 1 million images of skin problems. Only a quarter of those images were available for experts or the public to review, the analysis found. Fourteen of the studies included information about the ethnicity or race of the patients in their data, and only seven described their skin types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="42RGse"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I highly suspect that these datasets are not diverse, but there is no way to know”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IxUWF"&gt;The rest did not share the demographic breakdown of their patients. “I highly suspect that these datasets are not diverse, but there is no way to know,” study author Roxana Daneshjou, a clinical scholar in dermatology at Stanford University, said on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RoxanaDaneshjou/status/1440813771820208130"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NdZrg"&gt;The analysis also checked if the models that aimed to identify skin cancer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were trained on images where the cancer was confirmed with a skin sample sent to a lab — the “gold standard” to make sure that diagnosis was correct. Of the studies included, 56 claimed to identify those conditions, but only&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;36 of those met the gold standard. The ones that did not could be less accurate, the authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3E5MV"&gt;The review included &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3"&gt;an algorithm&lt;/a&gt; from Google, which developed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451361/google-skin-condition-dermatology-symptom-checker"&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; designed to help people identify skin conditions. The company plans to make a pilot version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;web tool&lt;/a&gt;, which lets people upload pictures of a skin problem and get a list of possible conditions, later this year. According to the analysis, the Google paper includes skin type and an ethnicity breakdown but did not make the data or model used publicly available. It also didn’t use the gold standard methods for assessing a few types of skin cancers, including melanoma and basal cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OswpqJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Medical algorithms are only as good as the data they were developed with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0UNUk"&gt;Medical algorithms are only as good as the data they were developed with, and may not be as effective if they’re used in situations different from the ones on which they were trained. That’s why experts argue that data, or descriptions of that data, should be freely available: “the data that are used to train and test a model can determine its applicability and generalizability. Therefore, a clear understanding of data set characteristics ... is critical,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pmn8QX"&gt;Lack of transparency is a consistent problem with medical algorithms. Most AI products cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) don’t report important information about the data they were developed with, according to a February 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/fda-clearances-artificial-intelligence-data/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; that its new “action plan” for AI pushes for more transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8zvPa"&gt;The limitations don’t mean most dermatology algorithms are useless, wrote Philipp Tschandl, a researcher at the Medical University of Vienna, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Physicians also aren’t perfect and have their own biases or knowledge gaps that can skew their interpretation of a skin problem. “We know this and still manage to practice medicine well,” he wrote. “We need to find ways through explainability, smart checks, and risk mitigations to allow algorithms to work safely and in an equitable manner within the field of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unagi reveals ‘The Eleven,’ an electric scooter that plays music, avoids potholes, and looks incredible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eps3GG-wBBl1PFmPpfOYAzCkssc=/338x0:2764x1617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898507/ModelElevenGroup.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2kYxMm"&gt;Unagi, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgz-OJdfhhU"&gt;Iggy Pop’s favorite electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;, is releasing its second model called “The Eleven.” (Yes, it’s a &lt;em&gt;Spinal Tap&lt;/em&gt; reference.) As such, the company is taking everything that was cool and stylish about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18080142/unagi-electric-scooter-kickstarter-price-specs"&gt;Model One scooters&lt;/a&gt;, and dialing it up to, well, eleven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWkiPw"&gt;The number of new, high-tech features on this scooter is truly impressive: swappable batteries, motion-detector alarm system, camera-based advanced driver assistance, and front and rear suspension to help cushion those potholes. But it won’t come cheap; customers can pre-order the Model Eleven for $2,860 including object detection, or for $2,440 without that feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2WUc77"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a full on urban assault vehicle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AaOZ9J"&gt;The Eleven is meant to be the company’s new flagship vehicle. “It’s an industrial work of art, the smartest scooter on the planet, and a full on urban assault vehicle,” Unagi CEO David Hyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpteG5"&gt;The Eleven looks fantastic, too. That’s thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5930539/the-makers-mark-yves-behar-fuseproject-profile"&gt;famed Swiss designer Yves Béhar&lt;/a&gt;, who made his mark designing iconic objects for Jawbone, Herman Miller, General Electric, and Puma, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5975203/yves-behars-most-iconic-designs"&gt;among many others&lt;/a&gt;. According to Hyman, Béhar “took over” Unagi’s industrial design team after investing a chunk of money in the company. (Unagi has raised $23 million in venture capital funding in the past year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A61AtO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10769282"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KvOpM"&gt;Along with a “rock star team of renegades across material science, electrical engineering, and client application development,” Béhar designed the Eleven using a new material from Switzerland called “long carbon,” Hyman said. It’s a type of carbon composite that includes other materials like nylon, which allowed Unagi’s design team to formulate the shape of the scooter using injection molding rather than carbon wrapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1viSl7"&gt;The Eleven is almost entirely made of long carbon, including the handlebars, stem, platform, and even some of the innards. It allows for a unique, full-suspension design, while keeping the overall weight light and portable. “The advantage of that is that you can get very complex shapes that you can’t do with a traditional carbon fiber,” Hyman added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="alnjsf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Compared to the Model One, the Eleven has a host of new, high-tech features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pDGapi"&gt;Compared to the Model One, the Eleven has a host of new, high-tech features. A multi-lens camera installed in the stem beneath the handlebars feeds visual data to an onboard computer, enabling the scooter to alert the rider about upcoming obstacles in the road like car doors or potholes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEk4WN"&gt;Hyman likens it to a vehicle’s advanced driver assist system (ADAS), like Tesla’s Autopilot. The feature won’t come standard on the scooter and will likely “add a few hundred bucks to the retail price,” he said. But in a few years, Hyman predicted that Unagi’s scooters will have the ability to slow down or stop autonomously to avoid crashes, a technology that is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252156/spin-scooter-remote-control-tortoise-segway"&gt;already being put to use by other scooter companies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvsmNx"&gt;“Our scooter knows the difference between a human being, a stop sign, a traffic light, or any kind of impeding danger that’s coming into the periphery,” he said. “So if somebody swings a car door open in a bike lane, you’re going to get a very loud warning over the audio system along with a visual warning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h0SDfN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10769321"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NHlHrK"&gt;Those warnings take the form of a ring system in the scooter’s main display that also helps with navigational directions. Customers can put a destination into the Unagi app, which connects to Google Maps through an API, and get turn-by-turn audio and visual directions while they ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4R8lX"&gt;“You never have to look at your phone,” Hyman said. “It’s all done with Google Voice over the audio system at a visual display. You don’t have to take your eyes off the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqDrFD"&gt;Hyman also described the Eleven’s audio system as “very pumping loud,” so it can be heard on a city street. Customers can also play music via a Bluetooth connection, which is sure to be a popular feature with Unagi’s various &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/10/01/1923644/0/en/Unagi-Scooters-scores-3-15-million-to-bring-transportation-freedom-to-everyone.html"&gt;celebrity and influencer customers&lt;/a&gt;, like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, Khalid, Halsey, Steve Aoki, and Billie Eilish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="es2tfB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Be the Forrest Gump of scooters,” he said, “and ride ride across America.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ldUHPz"&gt;There are five different riding modes, with a top speed of 19mph (30kph). The entire scooter only weighs 32lbs (14.5kg), and the battery provides a maximum range of 15 miles on a single charge. Much like the Model One, the Eleven will run on a dual-motor system, with each motor delivering 250W of power for a total of 1,100W for the entire ride. The battery, which has 67.7W of capacity, is removable, meaning a customer can bring extra with them and never have to worry about range anxiety, Hyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naCI2Z"&gt;“Be the Forrest Gump of scooters,” he said, “and ride ride across America.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Witk4T"&gt;Hyman is turning to crowdfunding site Indiegogo to raise money for the scooter’s production, which is an interesting move for a company that has successfully raised a lot of money from venture capital firms. “Tooling on this scooter is very expensive,” he noted. “So we don’t mind getting some cash upfront to offset the tooling costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRIP9i"&gt;Unagi plans on offering discounts to early adopters. And the company traces its roots to a Kickstarter campaign in 2018. “We could have done it with preorders on our site,” Hyman said. “But you know, this company was born on crowdfunding. That’s how we started. We’re believers in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Halo-themed Xbox Series X and PS5 are now available through Walmart (update: to be rescheduled)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6etFJjv5JSjBEKdsBpJGRqCC-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898014/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBOobq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:25PM ET, September 23rd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart’s console restock didn’t get off to a good start. Pages weren’t loading for most people, it seems, and the retailer updated its site with a header saying “Console event to be rescheduled”. We’ll update this post again once we know when the event will happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29Au4E"&gt;Walmart is hosting a big console restock event today, September 23rd, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT.  It’s going to have the PS5 consoles, along with the standard Xbox Series X and the limited edition &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;-themed Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbMpfd"&gt;In case you’re after that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed console, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Halo-Infinite-Limited-Edition-Bundle%2F288604110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;try your luck at getting one through this link&lt;/a&gt;. Spec-wise, it’s no different than the standard model, but it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;a more alluring design&lt;/a&gt;, both on the console and the included wireless controller. Two things to note: it’s $549.99, costing $50 more than the regular Series X. Another thing is that you won’t receive this until the game launches on November 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6F44Hm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10718933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="1LmOSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HhIaF6"&gt;For people who are eager to get a PlayStation 5, Walmart has both editions of the console available today. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You’ll be able to get the $499.99 version&lt;/a&gt; that has a built-in Blu-ray disc drive and a DualSense controller. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s also going to sell the digital version&lt;/a&gt; that lacks a disc drive for $399.99. Both consoles have around 660GB of useable storage, but they’re expandable via their NVMe M.2 slot. If you just plan on playing PS4 games, you can use a cheaper external USB hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch 4 is $20 off and comes with a free wireless charger today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The regular Galaxy Watch 4 has a touch-sensitive bezel, which is fiddly." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aotX4LF0nKdqEAnXgoVj3-BjHr0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898410/dbohn_210816_4717_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 runs Watch OS 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKg29I"&gt;Today only, the new Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is not only discounted to its best price to date, but the smartwatch also comes with a free dual wireless charging pad. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Smart-Bluetooth/dp/B099Y7SPHC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the combo on sale for $230&lt;/a&gt;, which is $20 cheaper than the watch would normally sell for on its own. The deal encompasses all available colorways, as well as the larger &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Smart-Bluetooth/dp/B099YPLVZ3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm version for $260&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer a bigger watch. The wireless charging pad you get with it fast charges both the watch and a phone, and it would normally sell for $60 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmxGIt"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 launched just over one month ago, and it’s the first device to run the new Wear OS 3 platform that Google and Samsung collaborated on. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that even with the software promises of Wear OS 3, it still very much feels like Samsung’s world and is best paired with a Galaxy phone. It’s a very capable smartwatch with snappy performance and expansive health tracking. With today’s deal, the Galaxy Watch 4 becomes an even better value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ufm4sT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10768955"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LBGZVj"&gt;If you’d like a pair of Samsung earbuds to accompany your new smartwatch, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals092321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Galaxy Buds 2 are $35 off at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. These are the latest wireless earbuds from Samsung, and even though they just released in August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/8/18/22630394/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-earbuds-woot-chromebook-2-airpods-max-apple-deal-sale-amazon"&gt;they have seen some sales from Woot before&lt;/a&gt;. Now, they have dropped an additional $10, hitting a new best-ever price of $115. You even have your choice of colors: graphite, white, olive, and lavender. The only thing to keep in mind is that these have a 90-day warranty from Woot as opposed to a one-year warranty direct from Samsung. Though, there is no better price anywhere else for this great pair of active noise-canceling earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7Qqg2C"&gt;If you saw Amazon’s recent announcement of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;new Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, you know that in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685873/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preordering the upcoming model&lt;/a&gt;, you can look forward to discounts on the outgoing one. Sure enough, today, the 10th-generation ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite has hit a new all-time low price of just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage-Special/dp/B07V3GSG2Y/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-waterproof-ad-supported-10th-generation%2F-%2FA-75574430%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals092321"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The new 11th-gen model will be bringing several improvements, but it also has a higher price of $140. Compared to this freshly discounted price for the 10th-gen model, let’s just say sometimes it pays to be a late adopter. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cxzNHP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10695294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhUTR"&gt;Apple users, if you saw the Samsung deal at the top of our roundup and like the sound of a dual wireless charger for your watch and phone, we’ve got you covered. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergedailydeals092321/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-qi/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon is discounting the Apple MagSafe Duo wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the price from $129 to a much more palatable $96.74. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;haven’t exactly loved the MagSafe Duo&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though a big part of that is due to its high price. Getting a nice deal on it is surely more worthwhile if you value owning the only dual wireless charging solution that can charge your iPhone and Apple Watch at the fastest rate they can achieve — plus, it rarely goes on sale. The MagSafe Duo also gets some style points for folding up nice and small to be a little more travel or hotel-stay friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TkwA9U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p5ygZR"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 has become a fan-favorite for people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;getting into exercising at home&lt;/a&gt;, as well as general VR gaming without the need for an expensive PC setup. Some households may have a tougher time sharing one headset, so the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal092321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy-two-get-$100-off deal that Oculus is currently running&lt;/a&gt; could be just what a couple or family needs. If you add two Quest 2 headsets to your cart on the Oculus website, the discounted price will automatically be applied, totaling $498 for two of the 128GB models or $698 for two of the 256GB. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Vid1"&gt;What better way to get in shape or immerse yourself in interactive virtual worlds than to do it alongside your loved one or friend while competitively destroying each and every one of their high scores? Mercy is for the weak. (Disclaimer: The Verge Deals is not responsible for marital or relationship advice.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android adds facial gesture controls and handwriting recognition accessibility features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhSAR5NLr-vSqy9nVE9ClpNFHzM=/0x0:834x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898307/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNVQfw"&gt;Google’s raft of &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-fall-2021/"&gt;new features coming to Android this fall&lt;/a&gt; includes some interesting new accessibility features. There are new facial gesture controls designed for people with motor impairments, as well as a new handwriting recognition feature for Lookout, a Google app that uses a phone’s camera to help people with low vision or blindness. There are also improvements coming for Google Assistant, Digital Wellbeing, Nearby Share, and Google’s Android keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKsO1o"&gt;There are two parts to Android’s facial gesture controls. Camera Switches (which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626754/android-accessibility-face-gesture-controls"&gt;previously been spotted&lt;/a&gt; in Android 12’s beta) sits within Android’s existing Accessibility Suite and lets you use gestures like opening your mouth or raising your eyebrows to activate various commands. The second part is Project Activate, a standalone app that’s designed to help people communicate. Here, facial gestures can be set to trigger actions like playing audio or sending a text message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/209OPL1Vbo4o5aBuQJQ181vUoaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871770/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using facial gestures to control a weather app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yje8II"&gt;Meanwhile, Google says Lookout’s handwriting recognition will be able to read out Latin-based languages and is accessible from its Documents mode. Euro and Indian Rupees are also being added to the app’s Currency mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30D3kL"&gt;Beyond accessibility, Gboard is also seeing improvements. Most interesting is that on all devices running Android 11 and up, Google’s Android keyboard will be able to use Smart Compose to finish sentences, similar to what’s already possible in specific services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973917/google-docs-smart-compose-feature-g-suite-update"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17340224/google-gmail-how-to-use-smart-compose-io-2018"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;. This feature has previously been exclusive to Pixel phones. Copying and pasting is also being updated to automatically separate out separate contact information and details like phone numbers and email addresses when they’re copied in a single chunk of text. Finally, Gboard will also proactively suggest sharing a screenshot if you immediately switch to a messaging app after taking one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAJhp7"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379419/android-digital-wellbeing-heads-up-walking-google-pixel-4a"&gt;“Heads Up” Digital Wellbeing feature&lt;/a&gt;, which reminds people to stop looking down at their phones while they’re walking, is expanding from just Pixels to all Android phones, while asking Google Assistant to “open my reminders” now offers a one-stop-shop for managing all reminders added to the voice assistant. Nearby Share is also being updated to offer new visibility settings, letting you control who can see your device and send files. It’s a real grab bag of features that should offer something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xsr0Pz"&gt;Google isn’t offering exact release dates for any of these features, and there’s no mention of whether any of them will be exclusive to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661647/android-12-final-beta-5-pixel-5a-stability-ui-changes-preview"&gt;upcoming Android 12&lt;/a&gt;. So expect most of them to gradually roll out over the course of this fall, which is generally considered to run until the start of December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda will use Google’s embedded Android Automotive in its cars starting in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Honda e Prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsHiATzJEHPEFIqd0QIKtSxgDv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898246/geneva_honda_eprototype_vladsavov29.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mn0CN3"&gt;Google nabbed another big automaker in its quest to become the default operating system for cars. Honda will soon begin rolling out vehicles with Google’s embedded Android Automotive OS, which includes Google’s voice-activated Assistant, Google Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps as the default infotainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fw9P7"&gt;The first Honda vehicles with embedded Android will start rolling out in 2022. The Japanese automaker wouldn’t say which models it expects to get the new infotainment systems first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJko9m"&gt;“We will collaborate with Google to better integrate Google in-vehicle services in our vehicles including the ability to more-easily use features like Google Assistant, Google Maps functionality and other in-vehicle apps offered through Google Play,” a Honda spokesperson said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gqrald"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honda wouldn’t say which models it expects to get the new infotainment systems first&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uut7ru"&gt;To be clear, Android Automotive is distinct from Android Auto. The former is the car’s default infotainment system, controlling everything from music to navigation to heating and air conditioning, while the latter is projected from a smartphone onto the car’s dashboard display and serves as a competitor to Apple’s CarPlay. Google also had a number of announcements regarding Android Auto (that you can read about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22453578"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdBDsA"&gt;There are only two cars available today with embedded Android Automotive: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;. But Google has made deals with a number of other automakers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17873502/google-android-os-cars-renault-nissan-mitsubishi-alliance"&gt;Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, that will result in millions of future vehicles released with default Android operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GchADo27AuvRadCIJQEPOscnN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872025/Cars_with_Google_built_in.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aky4h"&gt;The news that Honda is joining the Android Automotive party won’t come as a complete surprise, given that the automaker’s current operating system has been Android-based for years. Honda was also part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5279116/google-open-automotive-alliance-android-car-announcement"&gt;Google-led Open Automotive Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, along with Audi, Hyundai, and chipmaker Nvidia, which focused on the integration of Android into in-car infotainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ndb0MI"&gt;But it can also be a slippery slope. Initially, car companies seemed to want &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14268252/apple-carplay-google-android-auto-vs-carmakers"&gt;to keep big tech companies at arm’s length&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from tapping into the lucrative customer data streams flowing in and out of their vehicles. But Honda figures that by letting Google under the hood, it can probably sell more cars to customers who would prefer a more smartphone-like in-car experience than the OS software currently provided by the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xIUljj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a new dashboard for Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
