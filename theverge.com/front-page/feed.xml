    <title>GoPro announces Hero 10 Black with 5.3K60 and smartphone-like features</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxGdhOQ9nQCHMwhdxfcLqZS1YEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866244/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtLuLw"&gt;GoPro has announced the next version of its action camera, which has a new processor that lets the camera shoot in higher frame rates (for that cool slow-motion footage), have better stabilization, and automatically upload videos to the cloud while charging. The new processor also works to make using the GoPro Hero 10 Black a faster, more responsive experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXH0lD"&gt;In a lot of cases, the Hero 10 can shoot at double the frame rate of the Hero 9: it can now shoot at 5.3K at 60 frames per second (offering both the frame rate improvement as well as a small resolution bump) and can shoot at 4K120, and 2.7K240. While 240fps is still as slow (er, fast?) as the camera will get, it’s now able to shoot that frame rate at 2.7K, versus the 1080 resolution limit of the GoPro Hero 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3PvkVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of GoPro’s biggest competition is phone cameras, and it’s more like a phone than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qI2gAq"&gt;GoPro says this increase in performance is due to the camera’s new GP2 processor, which is a successor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fwhat-is-the-gp1-chip-in-hero6-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GP1 chip it’s used in cameras ever since the Hero 6 Black&lt;/a&gt;. The company continuing to have custom chips for its cameras is a tactic that makes sense, as some of GoPro’s toughest competition comes from the smartphone market, where companies like Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;and Google&lt;/a&gt; are taking the same approach. The GP2 also allows the Hero 10 to be phone-like in a few ways, from its very responsive touchscreen to the heavy video processing that it's doing with things like local tone mapping and improved noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u74tCr"&gt;Arguably, though, one of the most smartphone-esque features is the camera's ability to upload videos to the cloud while it’s charging. However, doing so will require &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fsubscribe-to-gopro-subscription%2FGoProPlusYearly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a GoPro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 a month or $50 a year. The subscription also gets you $100 off the camera, bringing its price of $499 down to $399, and it also includes access to GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-Subscription-Camera-Replacement-FAQ/ta-p/394296"&gt;damaged camera replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. The launch price, though, represents the slow creep up of the cost of GoPro’s cameras — without a subscription, the Hero 9 cost $450 at launch, which was itself up from $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892060/gopro-hero-8-black-mounitng-system-software-specs-price-ship"&gt;with the Hero 8&lt;/a&gt;. This year, of course, there’s also the possible factor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the ever-present chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ihdly_jTD5S3x-1x5hazefgXzEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853035/UuWJ4Owe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro continues to push its subscription by offering discounts and adding new features that rely on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="buOYUB"&gt;For those who don’t want a subscription, it’s also easier to get footage off the camera with your smartphone. GoPro says the new chip makes wireless transfers to its app 30 percent faster, and there’s also a new option to transfer your footage with an honest-to-goodness cable for those really looking for reliable, fast offloading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikY9y85R8pkH_IzQX2fuEkas-HQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853257/GPOP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro’s maximum horizon leveling mixed with HyperSmooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOYQaD"&gt;The new camera also comes with a few smaller improvements that make it more appealing. The camera’s “horizon leveling” feature, where it tries to keep the horizon as a straight line, lets the camera tilt up to 45 degrees before the sky starts moving, compared to the 27 degrees from the Hero 9. Unfortunately, the improved horizon leveling isn’t available on the camera’s highest resolutions and frame rates, as it’s limited to 4K at 60 frames per second and 2.7K or 1080 at 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiem0Y"&gt;The still photos the camera takes are also getting a resolution bump, from 20MP to 23MP, with still frames pulled from video reaching 19.6MP when shooting in the camera’s 5K 4:3 mode and 15.8MP when shooting in the 5.3K60 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mooYPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hero 10 has some quality-of-life improvements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yo91xI"&gt;GoPro also says that a new generation of its HyperSmooth stabilization feature can be used while you’re streaming live — though getting the highest video quality from your streams will also require a GoPro subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWNh8U"&gt;If you had a Hero 9 and bought some of GoPro’s Mod add-ons, the company says most of them should be compatible — including the Max Lens Mod, though support for it will be coming in a future software update. Even the stock lens gets a bit of improvement, though, with GoPro saying that it should repeal water easier and be harder to scratch. (And, of course, it’s still removable.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A familiar body, but with all-new brains&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ObBlrn"&gt;Last year GoPro did a complete overhaul of its Hero action camera lineup with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;. It added a front-facing screen, 5K filming, and more battery life. This year’s GoPro Hero10 is an iterative update that builds on the foundation laid by the 9. But while the $500 Hero10 looks almost identical to the Hero9, there is one big change that sets the stage for much bigger things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="msg5t9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10755081"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlNfDg"&gt;Although GoPro claims the Hero10 is 3 percent lighter than the Hero9 (153g vs. 158g), it feels identical in my hands. The one distinguishing feature between the two models is the blue labeling on the Hero10, versus the silver decals on the Hero9. There is a grippy, rubber finish; stowable mounting prongs; two physical rubber buttons for power, mode switching, and recording; two screens; and a latching battery, USB-C port, and microSD card slot compartment. GoPro claims the removable lens covers are more scratch resistant and water-repelling, while at the same time producing less ghosting. I didn’t have any trouble with my Hero9’s lens cover, but more protection is always welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_JiZxMHZkOOxjfIA4ZowFUXddc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851873/bfarsace_210909_4746_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 has the same hardware as the Hero 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6D4cmdRZzXPAqPO9hALVAvQRIUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851869/bfarsace_210909_4746_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a rubber record button on the top of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETShAt2tvAjhrC-Ao5HWjfWOGiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851867/bfarsace_210909_4746_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rubber button on the side of the camera is for power and mode switching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmlCGp"&gt;Internally the GoPro Hero10 is getting a big upgrade with the new GP2 processor. This is the first processor change to the Hero lineup since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16388394/hero-6-black-hands-on-sample-video-photos"&gt;Hero6&lt;/a&gt; that came out in 2017, and it provides a much needed speed update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK4Fga"&gt;First, GoPro claims the Hero10 can upload footage to your phone or the cloud 30 percent faster because of the GP2 processor. And for the first time in the Hero lineup, you can plug your GoPro directly into your phone for 50 percent faster uploads to your device via GoPro’s Quik app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zjHug"&gt;Second, the front screen now has a higher frame rate, even though it is exactly the same hardware as the Hero9. In most modes you will now see a 30fps image on that front screen. I also noticed there is a lot less lag on the front screen when actively recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3kGDI"&gt;But more importantly, the third speed boost, and the most notable one, is that the Hero10 can capture content quicker. In photo mode, the Hero10 both takes and saves a photo much faster than the Hero9. I was able to take three HDR photos on the Hero10 before a single photo was done processing on the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XlsuM"&gt;That speed is also noticeable when stopping a video recording, where the Hero10 is able to save the recorded video faster so you can get back to the live view and menus. All of that being said, there is still a lag that I find especially annoying when attempting to snap photos. The system is still far from perfect for a quick photo capture. But with higher resolution screen grabs from the video you don’t have to worry about snapping stills at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9Uteno0sjpm9y_9oh2vnA5ma4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851866/bfarsace_210909_4746_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New this year is 5.3K filming at 60fps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgHlVt"&gt;The Hero10 can grab 19.6-megapixel photos from 5.3K 4:3 video. That’s up from 12-megapixel frame grabs in 4K 4:3 video on the Hero9. In a 16:9 frame, the Hero10 can provide up to 15.8-megapixel photos from 5.3K video, where the Hero9 maxed out at 14.7-megapixel photos from 5K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSN3IX"&gt;Although this is the same 23.6-megapixel sensor that was used in the Hero9, GoPro claims the GP2 processor can get more out of it. The Hero10 takes photos in four modes: live burst, which continuously captures images as you hold down the shutter; burst, for a set amount of photos taken in one burst; night; and standard photo. There are also four color processing options that range from SuperPhoto for the most in-camera color and contrast processing, to RAW that provides the flattest image for post color work. Across the board, the photos are punchy in perfect lighting but take on a lot of grain in lower light, even in night mode. I’ve never viewed a GoPro camera as a photo-first tool, and even with the higher megapixel photos, this camera is best in video mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oLoJEg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10755129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="nDYPfc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the GoPro Hero10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="AbtIyP"&gt;The Hero10 can shoot 5.3K video at 60fps, 4K at 120fps, and 2.7K at 240fps. That is a frame rate boost at every resolution compared to the Hero9, and that 5.3K60 setting is really great for dreamy shots of water or snow flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLK4t"&gt;GoPro is also releasing HyperSmooth 4.0, GoPro’s in-body stabilization software, with the Hero10. Long gone are the days of needing a gimbal for a GoPro. There are three stabilization levels: boost, standard, or off. Boost crops your image the most but provides the best stabilization. With HyperSmooth 4.0 also comes an extended tilt limit of its horizon leveling feature, letting you get more sideways while still maintaining a level shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiTKta"&gt;If GoPro continues to improve this feature, I could see there being a day where needing to mount your GoPro level to the horizon is no more, much like Insta360’s micro action camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319707/insta360-go-2-action-camera-test-price-specs-features"&gt;the Go 2&lt;/a&gt;, that supports 360-degree horizontal leveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyvihk"&gt;The Hero10 also uses the same batteries as the Hero9, although at the highest capture resolutions, like the new 5.3K 60fps, you will see greater battery drain. I was needing two batteries to get through a full day of casual filming in these high resolutions as opposed to one battery for a day of casual filming with the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Qwwu54J95fUzcJwg0VOAyZrhVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851872/bfarsace_210909_4746_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 is still waterproof up to 33 feet without external housing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNJCBl"&gt;The Hero9 and Hero10 footage is almost indistinguishable once exported. With the Hero10’s 5.3K footage there is a teeny-tiny bit more room to punch in, but unless you are a 60fps super fan, I think most Hero9 users won’t need to upgrade this year. GoPro claims the GP2 processor also allows for local tone mapping and 3D noise reduction in it’s video algorithms, not just in photos, which should provide for better low-light performance and better detail in small, typically tough to film places such as blades of grass. But while I found the Hero10 to have slightly better low-light performance, there is still a lot of smoothing and noise happening to the image, and there is still a graininess to the image when lighting conditions are not perfect. Check out our video above for loads of samples where you can see that this camera still performs best on sunny, blue sky days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A8SbS"&gt;The last change in image is in the color differences between the two cameras. This year GoPro is natively setting the Hero10’s color preset to natural as opposed to vivid, or “GoPro Color” on the Hero9. Although, again, you really have to pixel peep to see a difference between the two settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCjsVF"&gt;There are a few features I didn’t get to test in my time with the Hero10 that will be rolling out in a large software update coming on November 16th. The Hero10 will be getting Max lens mod support, a few additional resolutions including 24fps at all resolutions, and the SuperView lens at 5.3K 30, 25, and 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOGob5LpGiSXwmrY9FXGHJc0RUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851868/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $500, the Hero 10 is the most expensive Hero camera since the Hero6 launched in 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpL6yk"&gt;The Hero10 remains a great action camera because of its size, durability, and 5.3K 60fps abilities. There is simply no other camera this size that is this powerful, and if you currently own a Hero8 or older, the Hero10 will feel like a huge upgrade. But I don’t think it’s a big enough leap forward for Hero9 users unless you need that buttery 5.3K 60fps or have to have the latest and greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY1hBA"&gt;The Hero10 is also very expensive. It retails for $500 without a GoPro subscription, $400 for existing GoPro subscribers, or $400 for new subscribers with an included year of GoPro subscription. This is the most expensive Hero camera GoPro has put out since it last updated the processor in the Hero6. For a hundred dollars less, the Hero9 is still plenty capable and still available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe5uCu"&gt;But, with all of that being said, the GP2 processor sends a very clear sign that GoPro isn’t done pushing the limits of this small, action camera. When GoPro released the GP1 processor in the Hero6, GoPro was facing an incredibly rocky future after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/15/14922328/gopro-karma-drone-review"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; at making a drone and a gimbal. GoPro decided with the GP1, its first custom-made processor, to slim down the company and focus solely on Hero Blacks, 360 cameras such as the Fusion then the Max, and its subscription service. Instead of going big in many directions, it set out to make a select few really great products that had enough features for the pros but were easy enough for a hobbyist to pick up, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPMN4W"&gt;The result is a balanced camera that provides plenty of resolutions for any task, an easy-to-use UI, and a subscription service worth its price. If GP1 is any indicator of how far GoPro can push its systems, the next few years looks very promising for the Hero lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LNtu5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10755247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Lucid Air is the first electric car with a 520-mile EPA-rated range</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="flyhpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Motors’ Air Dream Edition&lt;/a&gt; has received an Environmental Protection Agency-rated range of 520 miles, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNnVJP"&gt;The EPA rating certifies Lucid’s claim from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;over a year ago&lt;/a&gt; that its forthcoming electric sedan would be the longest range production EV on the market. It also represents a victory for Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;who led development of the Model S when he worked at Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and has said that the Air will outmatch Elon Musk’s company in terms of range, luxury, acceleration, and price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7a2gA"&gt;The Air Dream Edition bests the longest-range Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292629/tesla-model-3-long-range-plus-epa-rating-aerodynamic-wheels-mass-reduction-efficiency"&gt;the Model S Long Range Plus&lt;/a&gt;, by over 100 miles. But that added range will come at a cost, with the Dream Edition with 19-inch wheels starting at $169,000. If that sticker price is too spicy for you, it may be best to wait until 2022, when Lucid plans to release a base model that starts at $77,400 (or $69,900 with the federal EV tax credit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdRQwm"&gt;The EPA also rated the various trim levels, such as the Dream Edition with 21-inch wheels (481 miles), Dream Edition Performance (471 miles with 19-inch wheels and 451 miles with 21-inch wheels), and the Grand Touring (516 miles with 19-inch wheels and 469 miles with 21-inch wheels). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zu2GuN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OFHr41"&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range. Of course, range is highly subjective and the EPA rating is meant to present a snapshot of the Air’s performance under the specific conditions of the agency’s testing process. It typically excludes factors such as steep hill climbing and the effects of cold weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYjbbV"&gt;“The EPA estimates, including EV range, are meant to be a general guideline for consumers when comparing vehicles,” the agency says &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/explaining-electric-plug-hybrid-electric-vehicles"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. “Just like ‘your mileage may vary’ for gasoline vehicles, your range will vary for EVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e7l0f"&gt;EV range is determined independently by the EPA, as well as Europe’s Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which are typically more optimistic than the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYXtUg"&gt;The Newark, California-based company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;which recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, is gearing up to start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;delivering its first vehicles to customers later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and it has already built more than 100 near-final quality versions at its new factory in Arizona. Lucid is hosting a production preview at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21739985/lucid-motors-ev-factory-construction-arizona"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Plant factory&lt;/a&gt; (known as AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make iPhone 13 preorders a one-step process on Friday by following these steps  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_vNfkWDiabkczCTpDc4TicD6fM=/277x0:1456x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866078/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process lets you make your selection ahead of preorders opening.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQuvga"&gt;If you’re planning on preordering one of Apple’s new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of &lt;em&gt;pre-registering &lt;/em&gt;for a &lt;em&gt;preorder&lt;/em&gt; sounds ridiculous. But if you’re someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it’s a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuY6R"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-upgrade-program-iphone-12/?Bibblio_source=true"&gt;isn’t the first time Apple has offered pre-registration&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this route appears to have been reserved for customers on the iPhone Upgrade Program, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-month payment plan that includes AppleCare Plus and offers a phone upgrade each year. But now anyone can enter their details early to buy a phone with far less hassle on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU0o9c"&gt;To pre-register, head over to the Apple Store app or Apple’s website to get started. Anyone on the upgrade plan will have their upgrade eligibility checked and credit lines approved. Other customers can pick out their preferred iPhone model, register their carrier status, enter payment details, and pick out accessories and / or an AppleCare Plus plan. Just be aware that some users are reporting seeing a “Your iPhone pre-order has expired” error message, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk5eV1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Xkgk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp begins testing a yellow pages-style business directory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWoGji3-OfC6t9PD760h3gqVqT0=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865539/E_Vsa4mVEAEul1L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvQOnZ"&gt;WhatsApp is piloting a new business directory in São Paulo, Brazil that lets users find local shops and services with a presence on the app, the service’s head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Will Cathcart has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots show how WhatsApp will show businesses sorted by categories like “grocery store” and “restaurant,” before letting users chat directly with them. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-business-idUSKBN2GB1SV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the test will include thousands of businesses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTnmT"&gt;Although the Facebook-owned messaging service is most famous as a person-to-person messaging service, e-commerce has become an increasingly important part of its offering in recent years. As of last October, WhatsApp reported that &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;over 175 million people globally&lt;/a&gt; used the service to message a WhatsApp business account every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ovXeLN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm excited we’re starting to pilot a local business directory within &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.  This will help you find and contact local businesses, like your neighborhood coffee shop, florist, clothing store and more.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR"&gt;https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175339541188608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNeXLd"&gt;WhatsApp has offered a standalone app for small businesses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/19/16908810/whatsapp-business-app-launch-small-businesses"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and since then has added features like support for product catalogs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;shopping carts&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also started offering in-app payments, letting users make purchases &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/business/br"&gt;directly from businesses&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to sending money to friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefIMP"&gt;But this e-commerce push created problems for WhatsApp earlier this year when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;updated its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. The changes were widely interpreted as giving WhatsApp the ability to share data from people’s personal chats with Facebook, when in fact the changes only applied to chats with businesses, which may see data stored on Facebook servers. The new policy generated an outcry, with WhatsApp competitors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; reporting a surge in new users in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHYHY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Cathcart said&lt;/a&gt; WhatsApp is not logging users’ location or which businesses they browse when using the new directory feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R79zDw"&gt;As well as its app for small businesses, WhatsApp also offers a WhatsApp Business API to connect larger businesses with customers. It’s notable for being one of the few ways WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17636418/facebook-whatsapp-ads-monetize"&gt;monetized directly&lt;/a&gt;, since it currently doesn’t show ads like Facebook and Instagram. Although WhatsApp reportedly backed down from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069422/facebook-whatsapp-ads-sales-advertising-plans"&gt;immediate plans to show in-app ads last year&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s vice president of business messaging Matt Idema told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “over the long term” he expects ads to be part of WhatsApp’s business model “in some form or another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV08Nt"&gt;Although the pilot is limited to one city in Brazil for now, Idema said that India and Indonesia were among the candidates for expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1D3PE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqhV5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric scooter startup Gogoro is going public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnoYYOUurldpR7Kv0Ai4NHOz138=/450x0:2880x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865521/gogoro_1_burnout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gogoro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOGFX8"&gt;Gogoro is the latest EV company to jump on the trend of going public by merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. The Taiwanese e-scooter and battery-swapping tech startup announced Thursday that it will combine with a SPAC called Poema Global Holdings, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal — which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 — will net Gogoro around $550 million, and will value the startup at more than $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imR1KZ"&gt;It’s a huge step for the scooter company, which has been rapidly expanding this year. In April, Gogoro announced a partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;largest two-wheeler manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; in the world to bring its electric scooter and battery tech to India. That was Gogoro’s most major push outside of Taiwan to date — until May, when it announced an expansion into China through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440780/gogoro-china-electric-scooters-battery-swap-dcj-yadea"&gt;two more partnerships with established local players&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June, Gogoro announced a &lt;a href="https://about.bach.gogoro.com/news/foxconn-gogoro-partnership-battery-swapping-smartscooters/"&gt;partnership with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; — which has been rapidly pushing into electric vehicles — that is supposed to “accelerate Gogoro’s global expansion” even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUFk5x"&gt;Foxconn is contributing an undisclosed amount to the so-called “Private Investment in Public Equity” portion of the SPAC merger — essentially a fundraising round that happens concurrently with the transaction. (The PIPE will contribute a total of a little more than $250 million, while $345 million will come from the Poema Global Holdings SPAC.) The iPhone assembler is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, and has a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-geely/geely-and-foxconn-form-partnership-to-build-cars-for-other-automakers-idUSKBN29I0P9"&gt;deal with China’s largest private automaker&lt;/a&gt;, Geely. It’s also been developing its own EV platform for other automakers to use. (At least one of its forays into EVs has failed, though, as &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-s-EV-project-with-China-s-Byton-halted"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported this week&lt;/a&gt; that Foxconn has walked away from its investment in struggling Chinese startup Byton.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnI2Ud"&gt;Founded in 2011 by a pair of former HTC executives, Gogoro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;came out of stealth mode at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; where it revealed a slick electric scooter powered by two small swappable batteries. (In fact, it won our “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7509787/verge-awards-best-of-ces-2015"&gt;best in show&lt;/a&gt;“ award that year.) The company has spent the six years since executing on the vision it laid out during that debut: building out an expansive network of battery-swapping stations across Taiwan that make it easy for owners to quickly “recharge” their scooters. Gogoro takes the tech even further, though, by letting those battery-swap stations interact with — and occasionally help power— the local electrical grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1oD1n"&gt;The company has also toyed with some other ideas along the way. It has offered its two-wheelers up for a number of different scooter-sharing programs around the world. And it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;released a “sports car” of an e-bike in 2020&lt;/a&gt; meant to promote an all-in-one motor that the company designed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Project Taara laser tech beamed 700TB of data across nearly 5km</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Project Taara link" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMDaaIcOoqLvFtDmfPbJfKihNAE=/0x109:1179x895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865487/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Taara link | Image: X&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1c2BOG"&gt;In January, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243484/alphabet-google-shutting-down-loon-internet-balloon-company-x"&gt;shut down Project Loon&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative exploring using stratospheric helium balloons to distribute wireless internet (an attempt to use solar-powered drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/11/14240236/alphabet-ending-stopping-solar-drone-titan"&gt;folded in 2017&lt;/a&gt;). However, some technology developed as a part of the Loon project remained in development, specifically the Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC) links that were originally meant to connect the high flying balloons — and now that technology is actively in use providing a high-speed broadband link for people in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2czUXj"&gt;Sort of like fiber optic cables without the cable, FSOC can create a 20Gbps+ broadband link from two points that have a clear line of sight, and Alphabet’s moonshot lab X has built up &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/"&gt;Project Taara&lt;/a&gt; to give it a shot. They started by &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/exploring-a-new-approach-to-connectivity-861a0159f63e"&gt;setting up links in India a few years ago&lt;/a&gt; as well as a few pilots in Kenya, and &lt;a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/"&gt;today X revealed what it has achieved&lt;/a&gt; by using its wireless optical link to connect service across the Congo River from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3lg6z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The wireless optical link achieved 99.9 percent availability over 20 days&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwHaMX"&gt;In 20 days, Project Taara lead Baris Erkmen says the link transmitted nearly 700TB of data, augmenting fiber connections used by local telecom partner Econet and its subsidiaries. The reason for testing the technology in this location is not only the climate, which the team admits is better suited to wireless optical communications than a foggy city like San Francisco but the obstacle created by the deep and fast-flowing river. The cities are only a few miles apart as the crow flies, but Taara says a fiber link to Kinshasa has to run nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers), making it five times as expensive to get online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKCcmk"&gt;Despite sending its communications without the protection of a physical fiber, Taara says that during the test period, its link had 99.9 percent availability. The team tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that end users don’t know when their communications are using FSOC instead of fiber and that it aims to provide an indistinguishable experience. They also said that they hadn’t experienced any weather conditions in the Congo that affected the connection on this link so far. They credit its resilience in the face of haze, light rain, birds, and other obstacles to the ability to adjust laser power on the fly, as well as improved pointing and tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Project Taara pointing and tracking system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUye7h_veVKEUVmdMHdw_mAO2S0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854621/unnamed.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: X&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Project Taara pointing and tracking system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpZ20J"&gt;Project Taara links are placed high up, naturally, since they need to be able to see each other, and as you can see in the GIF above, they’re capable of automatically adjusting their mirrors to connect “a light beam the width of a chopstick accurately enough to hit a 5-centimeter target that’s 10 kilometers away.” The system can adjust itself within +/-5 degree cone, and the team says that if that fails for some reason, they can attempt to remote control them into a connection before sending technicians out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How do you cross-examine a whistleblower?</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fD94ICUNGdCKI-QrFBnWGC1Mxs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865023/1235132528.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Theranos lab assistant-turned-whistleblower Erika Cheung testifies in the Elizabeth Holmes wire fraud trial&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZLmaDL"&gt;Erika Cheung, who took the stand yesterday for her direct testimony, which continued today, is known for being one of John Carreyrou’s sources for his &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;blockbuster article about Theranos&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the article that’s part of the reason we are now witnessing US v. Elizabeth Holmes. (Holmes is on trial for several counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCMDX5"&gt;Cheung is, famously, one of the people who blew the whistle on Holmes. She’s even &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/erika_cheung_theranos_whistleblowing_and_speaking_truth_to_power?language=en"&gt;given a TED talk about it&lt;/a&gt;. The other major source for Carreyrou was her friend, Tyler Shultz, who also worked at Theranos and was the grandson of one of the board members. He is expected to testify later in the trial, since he tried to bring problems in the lab to Holmes’ attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfI6QG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t feel comfortable running the patient sample.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kxu3Y"&gt;At Theranos there were two labs, Cheung testified: the research and development lab and the clinical lab. She worked in both, starting with the R&amp;amp;D lab. Her position in both labs was largely the same — an entry-level job that involved running quality control tests to make sure the machines were working properly. About a quarter of the Theranos machines failed the test at any given time, Cheung said. By comparison, the commercially available machines failed much less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0WFjS"&gt;Theranos was Cheung’s first job out of college, and she worked there only about six months. During that time, she testified, she saw problems with the Theranos blood tests that gave her serious pause about their use on patients. In one email we saw today, Cheung wrote that she was happy to do quality control on a hepatitis C sample to confirm the test worked, but “I don’t feel comfortable running the patient sample,” she wrote. She didn’t want to give results to a patient from something that failed so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQf97D"&gt;Cheung was “stressed and uncomfortable with what was going on,” she said on the stand. “Behind closed doors, we have all these problems and they [patients] think they have accurate results” they can use for medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev2qgl"&gt;Cheung’s testimony established what the policy was for running VIP samples at the Theranos labs, that some results were thrown out so that machines could pass quality control, and that Cheung raised her concerns quite high up the food chain — though never directly to Holmes. Instead, Cheung talked to both Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately, and George Shultz, a member of Theranos’ board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w51cdJ"&gt;Balwani told her she was unqualified to critique Theranos, and that she should unquestioningly run the tests or quit. So she quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SI0ke6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The failures in the lab aren’t really in question&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ0JED"&gt;She eventually went to Carreyrou and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which are the regulators that oversee those labs. As a result, she was served with threatening legal papers by Theranos’ law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWSZXs"&gt;The failures in the lab aren’t really in question — the defense acknowledged them in opening statements. Those failures, argued Lance Wade, Holmes’ lawyer, just weren’t Holmes’ fault. And so, in his cross, he made a point of establishing in tedious detail all the experts that Cheung worked with, and the existence of their PhDs and medical degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LygSMi"&gt;And instead of trying to call Cheung’s credibility into question, Wade used Cheung to introduce the people in her chain of command — emphasizing her distance from Holmes. He also used her to introduce documents about lab regulations from CMS. There was a 120-page long document that set out standards from the lab assistants like Cheung to the very top of the lab. Per these regulations, a lab assistant — the lowest-level employee — must have a bachelor’s degree in science. That means Holmes wasn’t qualified even to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3l6xQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who supposedly invented this revolutionary technology couldn’t work in her own lab&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZMBIo"&gt;You can look at that two ways. One is that Holmes, unqualified founder, couldn’t have known how bad things were in the lab because she didn’t have a degree. The other is that it is &lt;em&gt;a big red flag &lt;/em&gt;that the person who supposedly invented this revolutionary technology couldn’t work in her own lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pHjLG"&gt;Wade also went through documentation that showed that throwing out “outlier” samples was mentioned — bolstering his opening argument that nothing Theranos was doing was secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEpKyE"&gt;We saw pages of documentation with signatures affirming the procedures. Cheung was asked to read the signatures aloud. None of them belonged to Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RS9hqA"&gt;It’s still possible Wade will rip Cheung apart on Friday — I’ve seen some gnarly cross-examinations — but this approach so far is like water. He’s agreeing with some of the damning things Cheung has to say, but laying the blame elsewhere. For the defense, it’s maybe the smartest move on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 SSD buying guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWDkBFIMCrtecqUoN0dXd78QXjE=/6x0:1994x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674661/ps5ssd2_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxsstu"&gt;Sony’s update adding the much-anticipated support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;for M.2 SSD storage expansion is here&lt;/a&gt;, letting you install more PS5 games than the 825GB built-in SSD allows. When the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;first launched in beta&lt;/a&gt;, Sony provided a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;list of requirements&lt;/a&gt;, making it clear that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to just grab any SSD and chuck it in your PS5. We’ve tried to list as many of the compatible ones as we can, as stock has seemingly been hit pretty hard — the more options you have, the more likely you are to actually get your hands on one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E1aa6b"&gt;Which SSDs work with the PS5?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="jV7ZmR"&gt;Sony’s main requirements are that the SSD is PCIe Gen4 and at least 250GB. However, Sony makes it very clear that your SSD needs a heatsink, which can complicate things, given the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1420811116083662855"&gt;limited amount of space in the PS5’s SSD bay&lt;/a&gt;. What SSDs you’ll want to consider will depend on whether you want to install a heatsink yourself or not, and whether you’re a “play by the rules” type or a “let’s see what I can get away with” type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrTNPU"&gt;The best no-hassle SSDs: Install them and never think about it again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FD0cFH"&gt;WD told us that, based on Sony’s requirements, its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fwestern-digital-500gb-black%2Fp%2FN82E16820250184" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD Black SN850 drives&lt;/a&gt; (available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities) would work, and that it was in the process of testing compatibility. The drive easily surpasses Sony’s speed recommendations, but you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the version with a heatsink — for the 1TB model, the heatsink version costs $20 more than the non-heatsink version and has a big orange line on the front. It’s also the SSD that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cerny/status/1421686135936348161"&gt;PS5’s lead system architect bought for himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RnZs9N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvsMRw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/seagate-confirms-its-first-ps5-ready-ssd-will-cost-275-for-1tb/"&gt;Seagate says&lt;/a&gt; its upcoming &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fseagate-500gb-firecuda-530%2Fp%2FN82E16820248196" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Firecuda 530 drives&lt;/a&gt;, which have the option for an included heatsink, will work in the PS5 as well. When they release at the end of August, it’ll be $160 for a 500GB model, $260 for a 1TB model, and $540 for a 2TB model. You can tell the heatsink models by the orange vertical stripe near the connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RidVXB"&gt;If you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fgigabyte-1tb-aorus-gen4-7000s%2Fp%2FN82E16820009022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find one in stock&lt;/a&gt;, Gigabyte’s 1TB &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Solid-State-Drive/AORUS-Gen4-7000s-SSD-1TB#kf"&gt;Aorus Gen4 7000s SSD&lt;/a&gt; has a built-in heatsink, and runs at 7,000MB/s. (Note: If you’re willing to spend a ton of money on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Nanocarbon-Aluminum-Heatsink-GP-AG70S2TB/dp/B08XY93JT3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 2TB model&lt;/a&gt;, you may have better luck finding it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9xK7Cv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A helpful guide to installing an SSD in a PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0rbha4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tM2YBF"&gt;PS5 heatsinks: For those willing to put in some work and / or roll the dice a little&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y2wIlm"&gt;For an SSD that meets the speed requirements, Crucial told us its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcrucial-1tb-p5-plus%2Fp%2FN82E16820156280" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;newly announced P5 Plus SSD&lt;/a&gt; is compatible with the PS5, but you’ll need to install your own heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9nyhSC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPqDn"&gt;Heatsinks should be low profile — for the ones that are just going over the top of the SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;Sony wants you to add&lt;/a&gt; no more than 8mm of height, including the heatsink and thermal interface. Because of that, low-profile heatsinks like the ones below are going to be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UZipZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCfuOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RutnfF"&gt;If you’re looking to go all-out on speed but are still okay with installing a heatsink, Samsung’s blazingly fast 980 Pro is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u5Dq1S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPlE7H"&gt;If you’re looking at the 980 Pro, this heatsink from EK Water Blocks is compatible with single-sided SSDs. It also fits within Sony’s height requirements (and looks pretty, though it’ll be buried in your PS5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2hyUeJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677975"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNr0zx"&gt;If you’re willing to stick to 1TB of storage, Sabrent’s Rocket 4 Plus is another option. It does come in 2TB and 4TB capacities, but those seem to be double-sided, meaning that heatsinks for them are much more difficult to find. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-4-plus-m2-nvme-ssd-review"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, the 1TB version is single-sided, making PS5-compatible heatsinks for it readily available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8CLWhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ucha1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7bRzv"&gt;If you’re looking for something that’s got a built-in heatsink, but you’re willing to roll the dice on speed, Patriot’s Viper Gaming SSD matches Sony’s requirements. However, it falls short of Sony’s recommended speed, though it’s still rated as a Gen4 SSD. There’s also Gigabyte’s Aorus NVMe Gen 4 SSD, which has an official speed rating that’s lower than Sony’s recommendations, though &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Solid-State-Drive/AORUS-NVMe-Gen4-SSD-1TB/sp#sp"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it runs at 5,600MB/s when plugged into a PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="urMepF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OQEv9p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10755341"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X28FsF"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WpBZfA"&gt;I’m a loose cannon willing to bend the rules to expand my storage.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FyM2Ph"&gt;Some SSDs are double-sided, meaning that they have chips on both the front and back of the PCB. We reached out to StorageIO’s storage analyst and operator Greg Schulz to see if that meant that both sides needed to be covered by a heatsink, and he told us that “the denser the packaging, the more need to remove the heat.” According to him, the heat would have to be dealt with by airflow (which the SSD in the PS5 doesn’t seem to have much access to), or other methods ranging from “heat sinks to small fans to thermo tape among other approaches depending on packaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBWZNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to find a heatsink compatible with double-sided SSDs and Sony’s size requirements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNjQg8"&gt;For that reason, we’re putting the double-sided SSDs without included heatsinks into this category. While there are plenty of heatsinks that are compatible with double-sided SSDs, I struggled to find many that weren’t taller than Sony recommended (though we’ll come back to that note in a bit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pd11AB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683818"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfyjaF"&gt;If you can’t find a double-sided compatible heatsink that fits with Sony’s specifications, you’d either have to run the SSD with a heatsink on only one side and just hope it doesn’t overheat, or you’d have to try to MacGyver on two ultra-slim heatsinks like the ones below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V64oEq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tMxi8y"&gt;So with all those warnings out of the way, here are the SSDs for those who like to live on the edge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eef8LC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;We’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsabrent-rocket-nvme-4-0-1tb%2Fp%2F1Z4-00H3-00016" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sabrent Rocket NVMe&lt;/a&gt; ourselves (though without a heatsink). It comes in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities, and despite the fact that it’s slower than Sony’s recommended speed, it seemed to work just fine. It does &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-nvme-40-m2-ssd-review-a-high-performance-value"&gt;appear to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;, though, so the heatsink situation may be sketchy. The same goes for the 2TB and 4TB versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Internal-Extreme-Performance-SB-RKT4P-2TB/dp/B08P2CG4JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;faster Rocket 4 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GsEjLU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPio4X"&gt;Our contact at Sabrent told us that he had tested the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F0D9-001Y-00027" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; in a PS5 and that it fit — despite the heatsink’s listed height being way outside Sony’s spec (it’s just over double the height). He says that the console can close back up with the heatsink on, and provided pictures, but it’s still going in this category because of how different it is from Sony’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqOonx"&gt;Finally, there’s the PNY XLR8 CS3040. It meets all of Sony’s requirements and recommendations, but it also &lt;a href="https://www.servethehome.com/pny-cs3040-1tb-pcie-gen4-nvme-ssd-review/"&gt;appears to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this means your mileage may vary when it comes to heatsinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fDvOUS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cAY7TT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FFmqmE"&gt;SSD speed and spec requirements if you want to find one for yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xB4eVB"&gt;Sony says your SSD has to be at least Gen4 and have at least a 250GB capacity. It also recommends SSDs that run at 5,500MB/s or faster. PCIe Gen3 SSDs aren’t supported (we tried), and neither are SATA ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pUtS16ODVV1WvJqvxenGHAyRcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748004/photo1627558599.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s requirements screen that shows up when you install an incompatible drive. In this case, it was a Gen3 drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G5aqAw"&gt;SSD size requirements: what size will fit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OCS8df"&gt;The PS5 is compatible with 2280-type SSDs, which seems to currently be the most widely available size. You can see a list of all the sizes the PS5 supports on Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;requirements page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RTjJiB"&gt;What are Sony’s heatsink requirements?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XrQbU"&gt;It depends on whether the heatsink goes on one side of the SSD or encloses it on both sides, but Sony has diagrams &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;on its requirements page&lt;/a&gt; that show the exact measurements that will fit. Basically, though, SSDs with a built-in heatsink, or a double-sided one attached, can be up to 11.25mm tall. If you’re using a single-sided heatsink, you’re limited to one that adds less than 8mm of height. The maximum height not only includes the heatsink, but the thermal pads you use to attach it to your SSD as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony has very specific size / spacing requirements for SSD heatsinks, so you’ll want to pay close attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EVryHS"&gt;You’ll also want to make sure your SSD and heatsink are compatible; heatsinks come in the same sizes as SSDs do, and the sizes have to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQKa8b"&gt;As noted previously, you’ll also want to pay very close attention to whether your SSD is single or double-sided. That can be hard to determine from the product pictures, so you may want to either wait until you actually have your SSD in hand to order your heatsink or take a careful look at the heatsink’s compatibility list (if it has one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XQFlAs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leqych"&gt;When in doubt, check it out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma521S"&gt;Sony warns that even a drive matching all of its requirements may still not work. If you don’t want to deal with uncertainty, it’d be best to stick to the SSDs that people have tested and know are good, rather than trying to wander into the Newegg wilderness to find one for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmAPqt"&gt;If you’ve picked up an SSD for your PS5, you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;our install guide here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX launches its first private crewed mission to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zlRdLYfytlao0lWPhidnyR7k6LE=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864733/IMG_6341.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP79gQ"&gt;SpaceX launched four private citizens to space on Wednesday, kicking off the first-ever crewed mission&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to orbit without any professional astronauts on board. Dubbed Inspiration4, the mission marks the latest private foray into space as companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX compete to normalize space travel for paying tourists, not just government astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhsGjT"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on time at 8:02PM ET from the company’s 39A launchpad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, soaring from Florida’s east coast under clear night skies. Inside the capsule is billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a trained pilot and founder of payment-processing firm Shift4 Payments, and three others he picked and paid for to ride with him: Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant and cancer survivor; Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer at Lockheed Martin; and Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3K8aZW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Dragon capsule and crew are in a nominal orbit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="otHuHT"&gt;The crew was buckled inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon &lt;em&gt;Resilience &lt;/em&gt;capsule at the top of the rocket, reusing the spacecraft that sent four government astronauts to the International Space Station nearly a year ago. But for Inspiration4, the capsule won’t dock to the space station. It’s poised to spend roughly three days orbiting Earth at a higher altitude, some 360 miles above ground — the farthest human spaceflight since the last NASA space shuttle mission to repair the Hubble telescope in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOSExg"&gt;Roughly nine minutes after liftoff, Falcon 9’s first stage booster returned to Earth for a landing on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean. Minutes later, the Crew Dragon capsule separated from the rocket’s second stage as it was leaving Earth’s atmosphere, sending the Inspiration4 crew further toward orbit. The capsule will spend the next hour and a half gradually raising its orbit via intermittent thruster firings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GpFyi"&gt;“The Dragon capsule and crew are in a nominal orbit,” SpaceX engineer and livestream anchor Andy Tran said. A live camera from inside the capsule showed the crew waving and giving double thumbs up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aNH4RmqDNMa_Mn2w8qqp5UXLPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854133/Sep_15_2021_20_37_13.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="75fYH7"&gt;The mission serves as a multimillion dollar fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit research center that also provides free care for kids with cancer. Isaacman donated $100 million to the hospital and, with the Inspiration4 mission, aims to raise another $100 million. That part of the fundraiser has raised about $30.8 million so far. Isaacman, bankrolling most of the mission, won’t say how much he paid for each Crew Dragon seat, but they typically cost roughly $55 million a pop, according to a government watchdog report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWa6ML"&gt;Inspiration4’s Crew Dragon capsule was tailored for a more touristy experience than what NASA astronauts have on their trips to the ISS. Months before the mission, SpaceX installed a massive glass dome, where the capsule’s station docking door normally is, to give Inspiration4 passengers a 360-degree view of space while in orbit. Though the glass dome hasn’t been tested in space, SpaceX’s director of crew mission management, Benji Reed, said it was put through a rigorous testing and qualification process before validating it as safe for flight.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Exhaust from SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is illuminated by the sun just after liftoff, which occurred less than an hour after sunset.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Babuhu"&gt;The crew has a few activities planned during their stay in orbit — Sembroski is expected to play a ukulele made by Martin Guitar that’s stowed onboard as one of the several sponsorships riding along for the mission. Proctor brought along poetry and some personal art. And the whole crew is participating in a study on the effects microgravity has on the human body. SpaceX, Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine and investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine will collect biological samples from the passengers before the mission and plan to gather biomedical data on the passengers during the mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6HknX"&gt;Exactly where and when the capsule reenters Earth’s atmosphere after its three-day mission depends on the weather conditions around the coasts of Florida. The capsule can spend up to a week in orbit if need be, Isaacman has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usu9rw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:45 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with photos and additional information from SpaceX’s livestream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
