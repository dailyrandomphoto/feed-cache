    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tbxYNj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is one of the biggest apps in the world, and you’ve probably been hearing its name: the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/roblox-rblx-starts-trading-at-64point50-after-direct-listing.html"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock price climbed so high it was temporarily worth more than gaming giants EA and Take-Two combined. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has come up as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;contentious topic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkMIc3"&gt;But it’s also just an astonishingly popular app: 42.1 million people play &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;. And its popularity is surging during the pandemic. Daily active users were up 85 percent in 2020, compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUKT9a"&gt;Until recently, though, I didn’t really understand what &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; actually was, despite the app having been around since 2006. (Just to give you an idea of how long that is in tech years, the App Store for iOS launched in 2008.) So I spent some time in the world of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to help explain what all the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYo5EjSrbBJADgbQl0RApXiKMyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544249/Showcase_Filmstrip_1920x1080.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eKqRrK"&gt;What is a Roblox&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IXnLFp"&gt;I… don’t actually know! I don’t think there’s any one &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; object, like a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; block. I guess it could refer to the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; lets you build games that you can then explore? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siu2Wq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a game, even? Apple has me wondering these days. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSlXd"&gt;According to an Apple exec who took the stand during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, a game has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;beginning, an end, and challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Glad I could solve that one quickly for you. Roblox (the company), for what it’s worth, says &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; (the app) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;offers “experiences.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnn3Vj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1hQk3"&gt;It’s a platform where you can play millions of different... experiences... specifically created for the platform. A vast majority of those experiences are games, but you can also do things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;attend concerts&lt;/a&gt; or visit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546657/stranger-things-roblox-starcourt-mall-experience"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things’&lt;/em&gt; Starcourt Mall re-created in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I even went to a &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; awards show — &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sFU4T52yX18"&gt;built inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqwxlL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That all sounds complicated. How do you win?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu1Xyo"&gt;It is! And you don’t win at &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, really. Sure, there are individual games you could win, but the real draw of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is just to be a place to hang out, play lots of stuff, and maybe do so with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvbSaGkOODSZKAZbL7XH2yzO3XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702947/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.05.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s my avatar at the beginning of a &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; obstacle course game, or an “obby.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2ylbq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; where the cool kids hang out? The nerd kids? (Are the cool kids the nerd kids now?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UNdFB"&gt;Likely all kinds since it’s played by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;more than half of all US kids under 16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cl15r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. How is that even possible? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7nXZe"&gt;I’m not entirely sure. That’s a tremendous number! But since Roblox put that stat in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;the documents it had to file&lt;/a&gt; before going public, it seems like a safe bet. If Roblox lied to shareholders, there’d probably be hell to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZqet5"&gt;And while &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 12, it’s not just kids playing it; 30 percent of players are older than 17. Roblox told me that ages 13–17 and 17–24 are its fastest-growing demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrskB5"&gt;The need for entertainment and virtual connection during the pandemic brought a huge number of new players as well, especially with additions like &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/updates-to-private-servers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; dedicated space for virtual birthday parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdjVLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, color me intrigued: what would a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; birthday party look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KwnXo"&gt;You could set up a private party in &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; dedicated space, which can almost feel like a virtual rave. But I’d expect that more &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; birthday parties look like a bunch of friends opening up the app, partying up, and just jumping from game to game and world to world right from the launcher. In the span of an hour, you can hop through all kinds of different experiences because the app loads everything really quickly, which means it’s pretty easy to replicate the chaotic energy of a real kids’ birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vvh950Exhi_SVkDbLQIBFMwotXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702935/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.53.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; avatar in a psychedelic party space.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYqe8b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, yeah. I heard people do that kind of thing in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; too. Is this like that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O5q08"&gt;Sort of. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;the violence-free Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you run around a small island with your friends shooting paintball guns at each other, and, like in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, you can attend concerts at a huge virtual concert stage. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Creative Mode lets you build entire worlds and game modes using buildings, weapons, and other assets created by Epic. And &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; lets you build whatever you want with its blocky cubes and make games in your own private servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP11uX"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; largely offer fixed experiences around set mechanics. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, lets developers make whatever type of games they want — whether that be a third-person action game, a first-person shooter, or that time Lil Nas X threw a concert — and players can grab their friends and hop from game to game and world to world with almost no friction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlE3r1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, hold up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Lil Nas X? “Old Town Road”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53XhvK"&gt;Yes, him. He put on an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f12ukZuUwWI"&gt;epic, nearly 10-minute performance&lt;/a&gt;, towering over crowds of tiny dancing Roblox avatars and teleporting them to new virtual stages for each song. (Yes, including that one.) You can watch the whole show right here, if you’d like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tvtx2h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f12ukZuUwWI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SU0NCi"&gt;The concerts were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;a smash hit&lt;/a&gt;, garnering 33 million views across two days and four shows. (By comparison, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; huge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott concerts&lt;/a&gt; in April drew &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9422287/travis-scott-fortnite-billboard-cover-story-interview-2020"&gt;45.8 million viewers over five shows&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcP1ah"&gt;Roblox &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;has big plans&lt;/a&gt; for other virtual music events as it works to realize its version of a metaverse. At the end of March, rock duo &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ese3QtoWfkg"&gt;Royal Blood performed during the in-game “Bloxys” awards&lt;/a&gt; and premiered a new song. Also, Roblox would &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like not to get sued over music rights, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;it just signed deals with Sony&lt;/a&gt; and BMG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvQOYR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probably wise. So what’s a metaverse? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyiJ4p"&gt;I think of a metaverse as a collection of virtual worlds, landscapes, and characters that you can experience in one shared space. One example is &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which lets players dress up as characters from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;huge range of popular franchises&lt;/a&gt; across movies, other video games, and even sports. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has a huge range of virtual worlds that you can go to and games to play that can take place in any kind of environment that a developer can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2aUih"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s say I just want to play the games, though — what can I play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zk3WEr"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, in the span of 15 minutes, you can easily check out a handful of games in just about any genre you can think of. In a popular third-person horror game called &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862/Piggy-BOOK-2-Egg-Hunt?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piggy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I had to flee from a terrifying pig wielding a baseball bat. One of the top &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; genres is “&lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/?Keyword=obbys"&gt;obbys&lt;/a&gt;,” short for “obstacle courses,” where you have to navigate precarious platforms and avoid, well, obstacles. I even found a clone of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/301549746/Counter-Blox?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counter Blox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QElUod"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are they good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tHv5O"&gt;That’s a tough question to answer, actually. Often, playing a “good” &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game or even being good at a game is secondary to just hanging out with your friends. A lot of games lean into this more relaxed vibe by focusing heavily on roleplaying elements — and I mean roleplaying in the most literal sense of the term. In one game I tried, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/192800/Work-at-a-Pizza-Place?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;I worked at a pizza parlor&lt;/a&gt;. In another, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5712833750/Animal-Simulator?refPageId=41371707-4429-4e79-a225-acfe7fb6c395"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I galloped around a virtual world as a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eegsyw"&gt;One of the top games on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4924922222/Brookhaven-RP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brookhaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drops you in a small town, lets you pick a house and car, and gives you free rein to just be a person in the town you loaded in. (It reminded me of a kid-friendly version of a &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying server.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnYNHHoVxaCYV1DMie3LHMFVt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702930/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.47.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Me in front of my new house in &lt;/em&gt;Brookhaven, &lt;em&gt;a popular &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; game. I have no idea who the cool skateboard person is. They photobombed me.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNDFsq"&gt;You shouldn’t hop into &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; expecting to play games with the production values of something like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;. Many of the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games I’ve tried feel somewhat rudimentary, offering simple controls and graphics. But the point isn’t really to go pro in any one &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game — it’s more that there are millions of virtual spaces to hang out, and many of them have the added benefit of being games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6BCiY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite game you’ve played?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUnqJ8"&gt;Thanks for asking. &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/69184822/Theme-Park-Tycoon-2"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;Theme Park Tycoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Roller Coaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; clone that brought back a lot of my capitalist theme park-building instincts from my childhood. I’ve been going out of my way to avoid playing it so that I can actually finish this article. I also like jumping into random obbys, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6174369490/Escape-Mcdonalds-Parkour?refPageId=12a47271-4f5b-49c2-849f-d5edb3a54bed"&gt;like this McDonald’s-themed one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II5bz9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I pick what to play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuK7L2"&gt;There’s not a single &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experience that you can enter in the way you can hop into a world of vanilla &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and immediately start building houses and crafting tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEQXRo"&gt;Think of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; instead like an app store. The “storefront” recommends games for you to play, and you can also search through the games available or browse through different categories and genres. A lot of players also share games among themselves or find things recommended online by creators and YouTubers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CDhyW"&gt;Because there’s so much to choose from, it can be overwhelming at the start. But since it’s so easy to jump into a game, you’ll probably be able to find something fun just by exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBAvUJWauNQWLH8TXj6Wt4gmzH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544266/Screen_Shot_2021_05_27_at_1.07.40_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s Discover tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zoLA5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who makes these games? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJQYf5"&gt;Anyone. Everyone! Kids do, and you can, too. &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/create"&gt;Roblox has free development tools&lt;/a&gt; to get started, and it &lt;a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/learn-roblox/studio-basics"&gt;offers extensive documentation and guides&lt;/a&gt; to help you learn how to make games for the platform. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, where you’re literally building the environments around you using blocks, Roblox offers developers a more traditional suite of game development tools along the lines of Unity or Unreal Engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtZs"&gt;And it’s not just amateurs making &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games — there are entire studios dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. I spoke with one, The Gang Stockholm, while writing this article, and they’ve now built &lt;a href="https://blasterhub.com/2021/05/roblox-nerf-strike-beta-thoughts/"&gt;an official Nerf battle arena game&lt;/a&gt; for toymaker Hasbro. One of &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; top games, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/920587237/Adopt-Me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adopt Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, grew from a two-person development team to being supported by a full development studio that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xn4e/how-these-developers-hope-to-build-a-100-person-game-studio-inside-roblox"&gt;has ambitions to hire 100 developers&lt;/a&gt; by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2I8IqV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there’s money to be made in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IakPY4"&gt;Developers can make money by selling things like items, cosmetics, or avatars (often in their own in-game stores similar to those in mobile apps) in exchange for &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; in-app currency, Robux. And it seems like some of the most successful games can pay out nicely, once they’ve reached critical mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMHfkU"&gt;But if you’re considering developing games for Roblox, you should know that Roblox (the company) can take an &lt;a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics"&gt;up to 73 percent&lt;/a&gt; cut of revenue from Robux players spend on your games if you decide to cash out Robux into real money. That’s much higher than the 30 percent cut taken by Apple and Google’s app stores (in most cases) and the 12 percent cut Epic Games takes from games on the Epic Games Store. The company will take less if you spend within the Roblox ecosystem, though, such as on ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXEVcE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say I want to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; now. Where can I download it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyghqZ"&gt;It’s on PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Xbox One (and, by extension, Xbox Series X / S), and you can even play in VR using &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/208260046-Roblox-VR"&gt;the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free to download, though buying Robux costs real money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18lJRA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for PS4 or PS5? What about Nintendo Switch? Or Oculus Quest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TmPkk"&gt;Right now, no, but Roblox hasn’t shut the door on the possibility of the app coming to those devices in the future. On the company’s most recent earnings call, Roblox co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/roblox-corporation-rblx-q1-2021-earnings-call-tran/"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt;, in the long term, the Switch, PlayStation, and Quest all make “perfect sense for Roblox” but that “we won’t share any ship dates for them.” So it sounds like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; could come to your Switch someday, but it’s hard to say exactly when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeyW0M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is hugely popular with kids — how does Roblox protect them from bad actors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTCzSq"&gt;There are a number of settings parents can toggle to help control what their kids can do in the app and even who they can talk to. Parents can also toggle a switch to require a PIN to change settings, and they even turn on a restricted mode that limits a user to only accessing content curated by Roblox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5E829C"&gt;Roblox also says that players who are 12 or younger have posts and chats filtered not just for inappropriate content but also to prevent personal information from being shared. That way, a child theoretically can’t share a home address with a &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; friend using &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; chat, for example. Players can also block and report users. You can read more information on &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/parents/"&gt;Roblox’s parents guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313120-Safety-Features-Chat-Privacy-Filtering"&gt;in this support article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ddfy0Y"&gt;Roblox is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389637/roblox-content-ratings-games-kids"&gt;content ratings for games&lt;/a&gt;, though hasn’t said when the ratings system might become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeZw6k"&gt;It seems there are still some potential gaps, though. &lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;Cecilia D’Anastasio, as part of an article with the headline “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/"&gt;How Roblox Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists&lt;/a&gt;,” detailed a Roblox experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpfsGs"&gt;And I don’t know how Roblox can stop kids from finding this &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-creepy-clown-video-hidden-in-roblox-1846804469"&gt;terrifying clown video hidden in the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxFKVV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could do without the clown thing, but Roblox seems like a big deal. So: should I invest in the stock? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y40OjQ"&gt;I can’t give financial advice, so you’re on your own for that one. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return"&gt;how wild the stonks market has been&lt;/a&gt; this year, though, I suppose Roblox, like anything else, has a lightning-in-a-bottle chance of being the next GameStop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;Better than spending that money on NFTs, right?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Melinda French Gates will leave foundation if she and Bill Gates can’t ‘work constructively’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDONESIA-IMF-WORLD BANK-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UfopBOBcHCfxDmt8Uhgb8SS6bdc=/0x42:4000x2709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552418/1051872980.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3TxH9o"&gt;Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418019/bill-melinda-gates-marriage-separation-charity-foundation"&gt;recently announced their divorce plans&lt;/a&gt; but largely left the question of how the co-chairs would continue to work together at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation unanswered. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2021/07/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-mark-suzman-plans-evolve-governance"&gt;a new statement from the foundation&lt;/a&gt; has offered some clarity: they might not (via &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/gates-foundation-divorce.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The foundation says Melinda French Gates will resign from her position as co-chair and trustee if either she or Bill Gates decides they are unable to work together after two years. It’s not clear how the organization settled on that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoBvoh"&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman announced the two-year post-divorce trial period along with the commitment of an additional $15 billion from Melinda and Bill toward the foundation’s efforts to fight poverty, disease, and inequity. Suzman also writes that the co-chairs have decided to expand the charitable foundation’s number of trustees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y3YUos"&gt;The additional trustees will bring new perspectives, help guide resource allocation and strategic direction, and ensure the stability and sustainability of the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38On7J"&gt;Per the statement, Melinda and Bill are “are fully committed to continuing to work constructively together at the foundation,” but if Melinda does resign after two years, Suzman suggests she’ll keep giving under her own brand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="t679yR"&gt;Melinda would receive personal resources from Bill for her philanthropic work. These resources would be completely separate from the foundation’s endowment, which would not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2N8rTv"&gt;The amount of those resources are unknown, but given Melinda’s &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/05/05/melinda-gates-now-a-billionaire-after-she-gets-stock-transfer-from-bill-gates/?sh=2da61953e5a5"&gt;reportedly significant personal wealth&lt;/a&gt;, her philanthropic work might not be hindered much either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjqUCD"&gt;Melinda and Bill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;long ago resigned from their positions at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; but have continued to have an outsized impact on the world through the work of their foundation (being billionaires helps, too). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has recently focused its efforts on combating the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/26/21237482/coronavirus-pandemic-gates-foundation-microsoft"&gt;donating $250 million&lt;/a&gt; toward the development of vaccines and other treatments in 2020. Last month, the foundation committed &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2021/06/gates-foundation-commits-2-1-billion-to-advance-gender-equality-globally"&gt;$2.1 billion over the next five years&lt;/a&gt; toward women’s economic empowerment, health, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEGvxU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiCPdc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon has its own version of spatial audio and it’s already pushing it on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdA7Nx_txiaOx-y7u2tg4yvul0g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552002/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h7fivc"&gt;You know spatial audio is having quite a moment when wireless carriers decide to create their own implementations of it. Verizon has announced a new sound feature it’s calling “Verizon Adaptive Sound,” and the company claims it “produces a brilliant spatial surround experience regardless of what headphone, soundbar, or earbud brand you use or what application you’re watching or listening to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNuXwO"&gt;The audio trick, which Verizon says has been in the works since 2019, is coming to Motorola phones first, including the new Motorola One 5G UW Ace that goes on sale July 8th. The Motorola Edge Plus also just received a firmware update that seems to add this feature, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/07/05/motorola-edge-update-adds-something-called-verizon-adaptive-sound/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jFwE"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is integrated right into the settings menu on Android devices in the sound section. From there, you can adjust sliders for treble, bass, voice enhancement, and spatial surround sound. For those who’d prefer to ignore VAS completely and hear everything as normal, it can toggled on or off in settings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrjWt6xY5uE9XG2fHYt6KgndHCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703786/Screen_Shot_2021_07_07_at_12.57.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhXV3I"&gt;“While some technology solutions have attempted to provide premium sound experiences to some specific (usually expensive) devices and to a limited subset of content, most devices and content experiences have been relegated to a disjointed, sub-optimal, and lowest-common-denominator-like experience,” a Verizon spokesperson said by email, in an obvious reference to Apple, Sony, and Amazon. “We wanted to change that.” Some devices that offer 360-degree audio do indeed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;come at a premium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHGt2H"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is based around “an innovative software and cloud-based solution,” a spokesperson said. That’s on the vague side, so I’ve asked the carrier for more specifics on exactly how it works and what it does. Is this just some kind of gimmicky, fake virtual surround effect? Or does it mix down Dolby Atmos channels (when available) to make the sound profile, similar to Apple’s spatial audio? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLxleo"&gt;Apple spatial audio works with AirPods earbuds and the AirPods Max headphones to create immersive surround sound — with head tracking — when watching TV shows and movies in supported apps. The company has more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;added spatial audio to its Apple Music service&lt;/a&gt;, though the results are very inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWaUx8"&gt;Verizon’s big talking point seems to be universal support across hardware and streaming services. But until we can give Verizon Adaptive Sound a try ourselves on one of these Moto devices, we can’t say how it compares to existing approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9kqCY"&gt;The feature “will be made available on a broader portfolio of new devices in the future, as well as some existing devices via an over-the-air software update,” according to Verizon. My initial hunch was that we’ll mostly see this on entry-level and midrange 5G phones, but the carrier told me it won’t be specific to budget devices. Does that mean Verizon will force this into the sound settings of something like Samsung’s Galaxy S21? For now, Motorola is the only partner being named. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump files sweeping, nonsensical lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter, and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - July 06, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8cVR--ep2OLrhzgoCisq0YyJcA=/111x0:3329x2145/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551618/1327350293.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Devaney/ GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEPVci"&gt;Former President Donald Trump has filed proposed class action lawsuits against &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.595800/gov.uscourts.flsd.595800.1.0_1.pdf"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.595801/gov.uscourts.flsd.595801.1.0.pdf"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.595803/gov.uscourts.flsd.595803.1.0.pdf"&gt;Google subsidiary YouTube&lt;/a&gt; as well as CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai. The lawsuits come six months after Trump was permanently or temporarily suspended from all three platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Qtbx5"&gt;Trump announced the lawsuits at a press conference today, following &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-lawsuit-facebook-twitter-82323cf3-b8ce-48ed-8cab-cafe31f0bae7.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;an early report by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He referred to the cases as “a very important game-changer for our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmU2sX"&gt;However, the claims are based on an amalgamation of mostly untested or disregarded legal arguments, and they come after numerous other failed attempts to sue social media companies over suspensions or other forms of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsowUa"&gt;The complaints allege that social media companies violated the First Amendment by suspending Trump and other users from their networks, an argument that courts have typically disregarded — ruling overwhelmingly that the First Amendment is intended to limit censorship by the government, not private companies. His effort is backed by the America First Policy Institute, an advocacy group founded by former Trump officials, including Linda McMahon and Brooke Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJIE1O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The suits are backed by the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpKbaW"&gt;Trump’s lawsuits seek damages on behalf of any users who have had an account “wrongly restricted or curtailed” on Facebook, Twitter, or a Google service. It asks courts to declare Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional. Trump paradoxically cited Section 230 as a legal justification for suing the companies in his press conference, however, saying incorrectly that “once they got Section 230 they’re not private companies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckCtHz"&gt;The claim also seemingly challenges the premise of social media terms of service agreements — complaining that Facebook, for instance, “expressly conditioned” usage on agreeing to “speech restrictions imposed by Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX6PIB"&gt;Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the lawsuit. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XY3y1Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Judges have repeatedly rejected claims that social media companies are public venues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QuxC7m"&gt;Trump described the class action as an attempt to stop companies from violating US speech laws. “We’re not looking for a settlement. We don’t expect a settlement,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference, suggesting that companies could be liable for “potentially trillions of dollars” in damages, “a number the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR4cKO"&gt;This appears unlikely. On Twitter, attorney and legal writer Eric Goldman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgoldman/status/1412798837647831040"&gt;cited an upcoming paper&lt;/a&gt; that found courts almost invariably side with web platforms when users sue for being banned. Judges have thrown out not only suits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272066/social-media-bias-laura-loomer-larry-klayman-twitter-google-facebook-loss"&gt;from conservative users&lt;/a&gt;, but also ones that allege discrimination based on protected classes — as in a &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/google-beats-youtube-users-suit-alleging-racial-discrimination"&gt;recently dismissed lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google, which some Black creators accused of suppressing or demonetizing videos about race. Users have prevailed in rare cases where censorship is done not by platforms, but by government agencies and politicians using them, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20688860/trump-loss-knight-institute-second-circuit-court-twitter-block-lawsuit-analysis"&gt;including Trump himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QbLid"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump apparently cited emails between Facebook and his own administration as evidence of collusion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jGHdV"&gt;Trump’s new lawsuits are far more elaborate — and often confusing — than many of these claims. The suits suggest Facebook, Twitter, and Google became state actors not only because they own powerful platforms for hosting speech, but also because members of Congress called them into hearings and urged them to remove specific categories of content, including false information and incitement to violence. (Trump was banned from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for violating rules against incitement during the January 6th riot that sought to nullify President Joe Biden’s election.) There is no legal precedent for using this common practice — which the suits refer to as “legislative coercion” — as a justification for punishing companies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDvlaw"&gt;Trump also accuses the platforms of “closely coordinated interaction ... to constrain free speech” with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the press conference, Trump appeared to cite &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-fauci-zuckerberg/fact-check-mark-zuckerberg-email-to-fauci-mentioned-pandemic-response-not-elections-or-ballots-idUSL2N2NM23G"&gt;an email thread&lt;/a&gt; between Zuckerberg and Fauci from March 2020, which was during Trump’s own presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTN7Uy"&gt;Judges have almost universally rejected claims that social media platforms are public spaces that must host any content protected by the First Amendment. While Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has pushed for more direct regulation of how companies can moderate, he did so in a case that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368045/clarence-thomas-social-media-regulation-knight-v-trump"&gt;effectively unrelated to the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY2KZ3"&gt;Trump clashed with social media companies well before he was banned from them this year. As president, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; asking federal agencies to reduce Section 230’s protections, but the order had little effect and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437627/biden-revokes-trump-executive-order-section-230-twitter-facebook-google"&gt;revoked by President Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; a year later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USlM5d"&gt;In the press conference, Trump equivocated on whether he would actually return to Facebook, Twitter, and Google should they rescind their bans. “I don’t know. I might not,” he said. “If I put out a press release, I’m getting extremely good pickup.” Trump launched a blog to distribute announcements in May but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform"&gt;shut it down within a month&lt;/a&gt; after attracting a reportedly low readership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hwA3y"&gt;Facebook’s Portal video calling device is getting a &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt; crossover that lets you and up to three friends dress up as characters from the play using augmented reality technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3GHvH"&gt;Here’s how you can use it, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-takes-center-stage-on-portal-with-curtain-call-ar-experience-plus-new-story-time-content/"&gt;according to a Facebook blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lv7bye"&gt;Anyone can initiate the experience by tapping “Curtain Call” in the effects tray on Portal. You can then select one of three locations from the menu to visit: Hogwarts Great Hall, the Ministry of Magic or the Edge of the Forbidden Forest. When the lights come up, each person on the call will embody a character from the show with a unique spell, which is assigned randomly. Simply nod your head or tap the screen to cast it and watch as your friends marvel at the magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Knr6Iy"&gt;The AR masks that transform you into a character, which are powered by Facebook’s Spark AR technology, will also match your skin tone. “Callers can fully embody the characters thanks to real-time skin sampling that matches the 3D character to your unique skin tone before converting it into an AR mask for seamless integration,” Facebook says in its blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6tSoha"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature works in the US and the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sz4JQM"&gt;The feature works with Portal-to-Portal video calls for users in the US and UK. And if you don’t have a Portal device, “fans on Instagram and Facebook can still interact with the AR masks via each app’s camera and share video and photos via Stories,” according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYyCSE"&gt;Facebook has been ramping up its augmented reality efforts; it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438403/facebook-spark-creator-ar-effects-messenger-portal"&gt;last September&lt;/a&gt; that creators would be able to make AR effects for Messenger and Portal in 2021. The company is also investing heavily in AR and VR devices, with nearly 10,000 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326875/facebook-reality-labs-ar-vr-headcount-report"&gt;reportedly working in its Reality Labs division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, a leather case for your MagSafe puck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ILxqlDEUnwChx43BVOb6jJg7F0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69551329/856500010205_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if MagSafe, but covered in leather?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldz8wB"&gt;I’m not going to pretend to understand how product development meetings work, but there must have been something pretty special in the water when Nomad’s crack team of accessory specialists put together its latest pitch. From the company that was brave enough to encase your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;AirPods Pro case in leather&lt;/a&gt;, comes an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-rustic-brown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all-new leather MagSafe case&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right, it’s a leather case for the iPhone 12’s magnetic charging puck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbQHjj"&gt;Nomad’s argument is that the case, which is available in either black or brown, gives a MagSafe charger “a classic, yet bold new look,” and that it makes the charger slightly bigger and easier to grip to remove from a phone. But it also costs $25. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5zK_6fLsV4DWMd50ob2xCvu4eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699659/856500010199_Lifestyle_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad’s expanded leather universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhHnC"&gt;As a tech blogger, I consider it my duty to maintain a base level of open-mindedness about new technology. But I also reserve the right in exceptional circumstances to point out when something seems just plain silly, and encasing a charging puck in leather is one of those moments. I can get behind the idea of a leather case for anything you’re going to be carrying around in your pockets to protect it from the stresses of everyday life, but a charger? A charger that you’re almost certainly going to leave plugged in next to your bed for 99 percent of its life? &lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVkJJ"&gt;If you’re already a fully paid-up member of Nomad’s expanded leather universe, and you’ve already got a leather case for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287731/nomad-rugged-leather-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111850/nomad-leather-airpods-pro-case-rugged-design-apple-accessory"&gt;your AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;your AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, then sure, why not also cocoon your MagSafe charger in leather for the hell of it. Maybe try following our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357436/how-to-patina-iphone-x-leather-case-saddle-brown-processor"&gt;exhaustive guide to getting a nice patina&lt;/a&gt; on your leather accessories while you’re at it. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII Remake’s directors wanted to show ‘a new side’ of Midgar with Yuffie chapter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOMu8IhVthIfmwJ1rPZoAGNxCR4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550977/FF7RIntergrade_AprilScreenshot_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F76Jpt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a complete story. Instead, the game explores the beginning of the classic RPG, with later chapters planned to finish the narrative at some point in the future. This means you’ll meet most of the main cast, but certain characters haven’t yet made an appearance — which turned out to be helpful when co-director Motomu Toriyama&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;started thinking of the game’s first add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsKhyr"&gt;“We were going to depict a side of Midgar that took place during the same timeline as the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; base game, and so I thought Yuffie, who was an optional character [in the original game], was the logical choice,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Even in the source material, she makes an appearance in the middle of the journey, but the events of her journey were never depicted, so I took the liberty to create this new story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0GRnx"&gt;The result is a short add-on called &lt;em&gt;Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt;, which recently launched alongside an enhanced PS5 version of the game. It stars Yuffie Kisaragi — a fan-favorite ninja obsessed  with materia, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21203140/final-fantasy-vii-remake-materia-size-aerith-hair-director-hamaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FFVII’&lt;/em&gt;s strange magical orbs&lt;/a&gt; — as she heads to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21213574/final-fantasy-7-remake-midgar-city-design-ps4-interview"&gt;the sprawling metropolis of Midgar&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with the Avalanche and seek out a particularly powerful magical item. The story takes place concurrently with the main game; you’ll even see characters like Barrett and Jessie in brief snippets and hear about the impact of events that they were involved in. &lt;em&gt;Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt; only lasts a few hours, but it’s designed to show the story and world from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="uSew5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10640850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ofxtnz"&gt;“Players can see a new side of Yuffie, the Avalanche members living in the slums, and the dark side of Shinra, allowing them to immerse themselves even deeper into the world of Midgar,” Toriyama explains. “By getting an understanding of &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR Intermission&lt;/em&gt;, I think players can further enjoy the relationships between the main characters and more of the world of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remak&lt;/em&gt;e opening up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78cjsc"&gt;Yuffie wasn’t the only optional character in the original &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; that launched in 1997. Players were also able to recruit Vincent Valentine, a gunslinger with a dark, mysterious past. And while his dual-pistols would probably be a lot of fun with &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR&lt;/em&gt;’s more action-oriented combat, his backstory made it a more challenging fit. Yuffie, on the other hand, had a less-defined history, making her an almost ideal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvD2SFfGumpAg2P5FsUHIzfhAhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703331/re_08_Battle_Yuffie_LimitBreak_Bloodbath_activation_stance__EN_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaz9l6"&gt;“If, for example, this were Vincent, he would have been sleeping in a coffin in the Shinra mansion, so we couldn’t move him around; but Yuffie was traveling the world as a materia hunter,” Toriyama says. “By having the events from Midgar depicted in &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR Episode Intermission&lt;/em&gt; be a part of her travels as a materia hunter, we are able to see the emotions beneath her fun character, which will then connect to the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yfBAG"&gt;Aside from the new story elements, the new episode also has some gameplay tweaks as well. One of the highlights of &lt;em&gt;FFVIIR &lt;/em&gt;is how each character has a very different feel; combat is completely different if you’re wielding Cloud’s comically large sword or Tifa’s kickboxing skills. For Yuffie, her ninja background means she moves incredibly fast and can attack both from up close and afar, giving her a distinct style among the cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0GLeo"&gt;She even moves through the world quickly outside of combat. &lt;em&gt;Intermission&lt;/em&gt; has a number of environmental puzzles that involve clambering up pipes and running along walls. “The controls focus on leveraging the lore of her being a ninja, so we were very particular about making Yuffie’s movements fit that unique characteristic about her, with having her deftly move across latticed walls and poles,” says co-director Naoki Hamaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dk10PM"&gt;The new episode is relatively brief — you can probably experience all of it in around five hours — but it manages to cram a lot into that small package, from gigantic boss battles to brand-new characters. And while we still know very little about when the next main part of &lt;em&gt;FFVVIIR&lt;/em&gt; is coming or what it will actually entail, it sounds like this isn’t the last players will see of Yuffie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6nZSe"&gt;“With this episode, we were able to delve further into Yuffie’s back story, have her go through an experience similar to Cloud and his team, and leave Midgar at around the same time,” says Toriyama. “This will then lead to her encounter them — as an ally — in the story down the line.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s actually making the futuristic CE 04 electric scooter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNQE_sd5ZLqY0rrdTAu6LjbW37c=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550920/P90428705_lowRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxUvz8"&gt;BMW has been warning us for years that it wants to make and sell a radical electric city scooter, and now it’s following through. On Wednesday, the German automaker announced that its Motorrad division will put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560306/bmw-electric-scooter-concept-motorrad-definition-ce-04"&gt;the striking BMW CE 04 into production&lt;/a&gt;, with decent range and speed on offer as well as plenty of futuristic vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryl6b6"&gt;The CE 04 broke cover as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560306/bmw-electric-scooter-concept-motorrad-definition-ce-04"&gt;a concept scooter in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that itself was basically just a reimagining of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/26/15698882/bmw-motorrad-motorcycle-concept-link-photos"&gt;another concept that BMW debuted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. What’s really striking about the images BMW released Wednesday is how similar the production version looks. Instead of watering down the bold design in an attempt to please a wider range of buyers, the CE 04’s bright orange accents and sharp, angular lines make it look just as much like it belongs in an anime as its concept predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YddRJ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s striking how little BMW changed the design from the concepts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pO7GtU"&gt;BMW is really angling the CE 04 as a city vehicle — so much so that the press release quite seriously opens with an &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0337029EN/the-new-bmw-ce-04"&gt;extended first-person narrative written from the perspective of a fictional owner and parka-obsessed city-dweller&lt;/a&gt; that I cannot recommend enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="49tow7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10640976"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypwkiy"&gt;This framing helps contextualize the limited 81-mile range, which is made possible by a lithe 8.9kWh battery (built on the same cells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462746/bmw-ix-suv-ev-price-specs"&gt;that power the new iX SUV&lt;/a&gt;). But while that pales in comparison to the three-digit range figures of most every modern four-wheel electric vehicle, it’s enough to cover the kinds of daily short trips one typically makes with a scooter like the CE 04. Driving in a city means there will also be a lot of braking, which presents ample opportunity to use regenerative braking to feed energy back into the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNOM40"&gt;For however long the battery lasts, it sounds like the CE 04 will be a fun ride. BMW says it has a maximum output of 31kW (42 horsepower) and a top speed of 120 kilometers per hour (roughly 75mph). Automatic stability control, dynamic traction control, and an anti-lock braking system — technologies that BMW has been iterating on for a while now, with the company going so far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle"&gt;developing a prototype self-driving motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; — are all available to help riders keep that quickness in check. A 10.25-inch TFT screen between the handlebars will offer onboard navigation and smartphone connectivity. (And the bike will have an “[a]ctively ventilated mobile phone charging compartment with USB-C charging port” to boot, according to BMW.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URT1Uu"&gt;BMW &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;sold a futuristic electric scooter before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13103000/bmw-c-evolution-scooter-usa-paris-auto-show-2016"&gt;the C Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, which was quite well-received despite never really catching on — likely thanks to the $13,000 price tag. Eager buyers hoping for a break here aren’t going to catch one, though, as the CE 04 starts at around $12,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Tgn2Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 7th, 12:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added pricing information from BMW’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grubhub will use Russian-made robots to deliver food on college campuses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TO-_5-2J1gun8PXu1PKtINdH5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550815/YanexRoverDeliveryMI_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p4Nktj"&gt;Grubhub and Russian self-driving startup Yandex are teaming up to use robots to deliver food on US college campuses. It represents the latest deal that envisions hundreds of six-wheeled self-driving robots that essentially act as roving lunchboxes in cities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLiXV"&gt;The robot-powered delivery service won’t kick off until this fall when college students return to campus. Yandex, which is often described as Russia’s Google, will operate the robots, as well as handle the entire food delivery process. Grubhub, which has partnerships with over 250 college campuses in the US, will serve as the platform for the delivery transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AAV6pn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating delivery workers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y87zhx"&gt;Grubhub cited the cost savings it will get by eliminating the delivery worker from the equation as a potential benefit from the deal with Yandex — though neither company disclosed the financial terms of the partnership. “We’re excited to offer these cost-effective, scalable and quick food ordering and delivery capabilities to colleges and universities across the country that are looking to adapt to students’ unique dining needs,” said Brian Madigan, vice president of corporate and campus partners at Grubhub, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76a5yH"&gt;Yandex says that its delivery robots can navigate pavement, pedestrian areas and crosswalks, and reach campus areas not accessible by car. “Such functionality enables the robots to handle delivery tasks traditionally performed by people and provides efficient last-mile logistics automation,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ7Iso"&gt;Food delivery via robot is nothing new in the US. There are many startups operating delivery robots of varying sizes — everything from fully sized minivans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;like Udelv&lt;/a&gt; to robots that look almost identical to Yandex’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"&gt;Starship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139394/postmates-serve-autonomous-delivery-robot-los-angeles"&gt;Postmates has a delivery robot called Serve&lt;/a&gt; that can carry 50 pounds of cargo. There are even some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265397/nuro-robot-delivery-houston-texas-kroger"&gt;like Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, which has made what can be best described as a mini-robotic car, that fall somewhere in between. All claim to be autonomous, but some require human monitors to track their movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGYR6F"&gt;Demand for delivery robots has skyrocketed since the pandemic, though it remains to be seen whether that holds up as the economy reopens and fewer people rely on takeout from restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXbA2l"&gt;Delivery services view the use of robots as one of the many ways they can cut down on labor costs and achieve profitability. Earlier this year, DoorDash acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics. But most seem to be stuck in the experimental phase, with companies unclear on how exactly to scale up the use of these automated helpers. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wPUuh"&gt;Ubisoft has officially confirmed the existence of &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game codenamed &lt;/a&gt;“&lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;,” after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/assassin-s-creed-infinity-to-offer-live-online-game-service?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the new online service-based game. While Ubisoft’s announcement doesn’t shed much light on what form the new game will take, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that it will be an evolving online game similar to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs1XUu"&gt;Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;marks what is likely to be the biggest change in the franchise’s history since its debut in 2007. Until now, Ubisoft has tended to release a new standalone &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; game once every one or two years, each focused on a single location and time period. But according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Infinity&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will feature multiple connected settings that may look and play differently, and this number may expand over time. The new game is reportedly years away from release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MuOfxS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A huge change for the franchise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKdcgG"&gt;The title also marks a shift in how Ubisoft develops &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; games, the company says. While previous titles have generally been led alternatively by its teams in Montreal and Quebec City, the new game is being developed under a “collaborative, cross-studio structure” between the two studios. “Rather than continuing to pass the baton from game to game, we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft’s most beloved franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner that’s less centered on studios and more focused on talent and leadership, no matter where they are within Ubisoft,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLG1C0"&gt;Development of the title has reportedly been impacted by a recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations that emerged against senior Ubisoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21305018/ubisoft-multiple-employees-administrative-leave-sexual-misconduct"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. Employees are reportedly angry that managers accused of misconduct are still in senior positions within the company. A spokesperson for Ubisoft told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; “Any employee that had allegations and remain at Ubisoft has had their case rigorously reviewed by a third party and were either exonerated or underwent appropriate disciplinary actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
